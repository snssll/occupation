1: In this task, the Earth Drillers are responsible for pouring water into wells or pumping water or slush into wells to cool drill bits and remove drillings. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality.

- E0: This task involves physical labor and direct interaction with machinery, which cannot be replaced by the LLM. The task requires hands-on work that cannot be performed by a language model.
- E1: The task description involves straightforward actions that do not require complex decision-making or specialized knowledge beyond the basic instructions provided. The LLM could potentially assist in generating written instructions or safety guidelines related to pouring water or pumping slush into wells.
- E2: While the LLM could potentially provide general information on drilling processes or safety protocols, it may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the physical task of pouring water or pumping slush into wells. However, additional software could be developed to provide real-time guidance or troubleshooting tips based on the input provided.
- E3: The task does not involve image processing or detailed visual instructions that would require image capabilities in addition to text processing. Therefore, this task does not fall under E3.
