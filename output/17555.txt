1: In this task, a Food Preparation Worker is required to perform cleaning duties in a dining area and kitchen. The task involves physical actions such as vacuuming and sweeping/mopping, which cannot be directly assisted by an LLM. The LLM cannot perform physical tasks or interact with the environment in a hands-on manner. Therefore, there is no way for the LLM to significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with high quality. As such, this task falls under E0 as it does not meet the criteria for exposure to LLM capabilities.

2: E0

3: High
