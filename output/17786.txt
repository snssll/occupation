1: In this task, the occupation of Mechanical Door Repairers involves winding large springs with an upward motion of the arm. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality. Since this task involves physical labor and precise mechanical work, it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM, which is focused on text-based tasks. The LLM cannot perform physical actions or interact with mechanical components directly. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not benefit from the capabilities of the LLM.

2: E0

3: High
