1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of studying consumers' reactions to new products and package designs, and to advertising efforts, using surveys and tests as an Industrial-Organizational Psychologist, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM.

- The task involves analyzing consumer behavior, which may require understanding psychological principles and conducting surveys and tests.
- The LLM can assist in generating survey questions, analyzing survey data, providing insights into consumer behavior based on existing knowledge, and potentially even suggesting experimental designs.
- While the LLM can help with text-based tasks like generating survey questions and analyzing data, it may not significantly reduce the time it takes to conduct surveys and tests in the real world, which involve human interaction and data collection.
- The LLM alone may not be able to directly replace the hands-on aspects of conducting surveys and tests, which are essential in this task.

Based on these considerations, the task of studying consumers' reactions to new products and package designs, and to advertising efforts, using surveys and tests would likely fall under label E2 - Exposure by LLM-powered applications.
