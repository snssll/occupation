1: In this task, the concierge is responsible for providing food and beverage services to guests. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality. The task itself is straightforward and does not involve complex text input or output that would require the capabilities of the LLM. The task is more operational and hands-on, involving physical interactions with guests and food service. Therefore, the LLM would not be able to directly assist in completing this task.
