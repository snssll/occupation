1: In this task, a Print Binding and Finishing Worker is required to trim the edges of books to size using cutting machines, book trimming machines, or hand cutters. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. Since the task involves physical manipulation of books and cutting machines, it does not directly involve text input or output that can be processed by an LLM. The task does not involve writing, summarizing, translating, or any other text-based activities that an LLM could assist with. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM.
