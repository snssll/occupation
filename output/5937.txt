1: In this task, a Roof Bolter in mining is required to drill test holes and test bolts for specified tension using torque wrenches. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves physical actions such as drilling and testing bolts, which cannot be directly performed by an LLM. While the LLM could potentially provide information on the specifications of bolts or torque wrenches, it cannot physically drill test holes or test bolts. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not involve activities that can be significantly expedited or completed by an LLM.

2: E0

3: High
