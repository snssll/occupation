1: In this task, a flight attendant is required to determine the special assistance needs of passengers, such as small children, the elderly, or persons with disabilities. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone or with additional software could significantly reduce the time it takes for a flight attendant to complete this task with equivalent quality.

- E0: This task involves direct human interaction and requires the flight attendant to assess passengers' needs in person. The LLM cannot physically interact with passengers or observe their conditions, so it cannot directly assist in determining special assistance needs.

- E1: The LLM could potentially provide general information or guidelines on how to assist passengers with specific needs, but it cannot replace the hands-on assessment and personalized care required in this task. Therefore, the LLM alone would not reduce the time significantly for a flight attendant to determine special assistance needs.

- E2: While additional software could potentially be developed to provide training materials or guidelines for assisting passengers with special needs, the core task of assessing individual passengers' needs would still require human interaction and observation. The LLM alone would not be able to perform this task more efficiently.

- E3: Image capabilities would not be relevant for this task as it does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images.

Based on the above analysis, the most appropriate label for this task is E0.

2: E0

3: High
