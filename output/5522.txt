1: In this task, an Agricultural Inspector is responsible for overseeing the quarantine, treatment, or destruction of plants or plant products to prevent the spread of pests or diseases. To determine the appropriate exposure label for this task in relation to the LLM, we can break it down as follows:

- The task involves understanding regulations, guidelines, and procedures related to plant inspection and quarantine, which can be accessed and understood through text-based resources. The LLM can assist in providing information on these regulations and guidelines, potentially saving time in researching and understanding them.
- The task may require documenting and reporting findings, which can be facilitated by the LLM in generating reports or summaries based on the inspection data provided.
- The LLM can also help in drafting communication materials such as emails, reports, or notifications related to the quarantine or treatment of plants.
- While the task itself does not involve complex image processing or detailed visual analysis, the text-based nature of the task aligns well with the capabilities of the LLM.

Based on these considerations, the task of directing or monitoring the quarantine and treatment of plants by Agricultural Inspectors could be classified as E1, as the LLM can significantly reduce the time needed to complete the task with equivalent quality by providing information, generating reports, and assisting in communication related to plant inspection and quarantine.
