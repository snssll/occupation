1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of devising, selecting, or purchasing a domain name and web address for Online Merchants, we need to consider the level of exposure to LLM.

- E0: This task does not involve any direct text-based interaction or analysis that would significantly benefit from the capabilities of an LLM. It is a practical task that requires decision-making based on business considerations and branding strategies, which do not necessarily rely on text generation or analysis.

- E1: While an LLM could potentially assist in generating ideas for domain names or providing suggestions based on input criteria, the core task of selecting a domain name and web address is more practical and business-oriented. The decision-making process involves factors beyond text generation, such as market research, branding, and legal considerations.

- E2: It is conceivable that an application could be developed on top of an LLM that integrates market research data, branding guidelines, and legal requirements to recommend domain names and web addresses based on specific criteria. However, the task itself does not inherently require complex text analysis or generation that would significantly benefit from the LLM's capabilities.

- E3: The task of devising, selecting, or purchasing a domain name and web address does not involve image processing or analysis, so exposure to image capabilities would not significantly impact the completion of this task.

Based on the considerations above, the task of devising, selecting, or purchasing a domain name and web address for Online Merchants is best classified as E0.
