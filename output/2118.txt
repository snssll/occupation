1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of cleaning, gauging, and lubricating gun ports as an Explosives Worker, Ordnance Handling Expert, and Blaster, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be aided by the use of a large language model (LLM).

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** If the task involves detailed instructions, specifications, or guidelines for cleaning, gauging, and lubricating gun ports, the LLM could potentially assist in providing step-by-step procedures, safety precautions, or best practices. The LLM could generate text on the proper techniques, tools required, and safety measures to be followed during the process.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the LLM may not directly reduce the time it takes to complete the task by half, there could be additional software developed on top of the LLM that could enhance the process. For example, an application that provides interactive 3D models of gun ports, highlighting areas that need cleaning, gauging, or lubrication, could be beneficial.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Since the task involves physical components like gun ports, having image capabilities could aid in visualizing the parts that need attention. An image-based system could provide annotated images of gun ports, indicating areas for cleaning, gauging, or lubrication, which could streamline the process.
