1: In this task, the helper-electrician is required to paint various objects related to electrical functions. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone or with additional software could significantly reduce the time it takes for an average worker to complete the task with equivalent quality.

- The task involves physical work that cannot be directly completed by the LLM, such as painting objects.
- The task does not involve complex text input or output that the LLM could assist with.
- While the LLM could potentially provide information on painting techniques or safety guidelines, the task itself does not primarily involve text-based information retrieval or generation.
- There are no clear subtasks within this task that could be significantly expedited by the LLM or LLM-powered tools.

Based on these considerations, the task of painting a variety of objects related to electrical functions would fall under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM or any tools built on top of it.

2: E0

3: High
