1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of reviewing and evaluating applicant qualifications for licensing, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it. 

- The task involves reviewing and evaluating applicant qualifications based on established guidelines and licensing codes. The LLM can assist in providing information on general guidelines and regulations related to licensing codes.
- The LLM can help in summarizing relevant information from documents or regulations, which can aid in the evaluation process.
- The LLM can generate questions or provide feedback on applicant qualifications based on the guidelines provided.
- However, the task may require nuanced judgment and interpretation of qualifications, which may not be accurately captured by the LLM alone.
- The LLM may not have access to specific, up-to-date licensing codes or regulations unless provided in the input.

Based on these considerations, the task could be classified as E2. While the LLM can assist in summarizing information and providing feedback, additional software that can retrieve up-to-date licensing codes and regulations could further enhance the efficiency of completing the task.
