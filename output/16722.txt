1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of taking inventory of supplies and equipment as a Cook in an Institution or Cafeteria, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be aided by the use of a large language model (LLM).

- E1: Direct exposure - In this case, using an LLM could potentially reduce the time it takes to complete the task by providing templates or formats for inventory lists, suggesting efficient ways to organize the inventory, or even automating parts of the inventory process through text input and output. The LLM could assist in generating detailed inventory reports based on the input provided.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While an LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task of taking inventory, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to streamline the process. This software could include features like automatically cross-referencing inventory lists, suggesting reorder quantities based on historical data, or integrating with inventory management systems for real-time updates.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities would not significantly impact the task of taking inventory of supplies and equipment, as it primarily involves text-based input and output. The task does not require detailed image analysis or editing.
