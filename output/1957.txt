1: In this task, a Coin, Vending, and Amusement Machine Servicer and Repairer is required to clean and oil machine parts. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality. 

- The task of cleaning and oiling machine parts is a manual, hands-on task that does not involve complex text input or output.
- The task does not involve writing, summarizing documents, providing feedback on documents, or any other text-based activities that the LLM excels at.
- The task does not involve accessing up-to-date information, specialized domain knowledge, or making recommendations based on data.
- The task does not involve image capabilities such as reading text from PDFs or editing digital images.

Given that the task is purely manual and does not involve text-based or image-related activities that the LLM can assist with, it is clear that the LLM would not reduce the time it takes to complete this task significantly.
