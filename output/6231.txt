1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of establishing contacts with employers to create internship and employment opportunities for students as an Educational, Guidance, and Career Counselor, we need to consider the nature of the task and how LLM exposure could impact it:

- E0: This task involves human interaction and relationship-building, which cannot be effectively automated by an LLM. The nuances of networking, understanding employer needs, and advocating for students require human judgment and communication skills.

- E1: While an LLM could potentially assist in drafting initial outreach emails or summarizing information about potential employers, the core aspect of establishing meaningful contacts and building relationships with employers is highly reliant on human interaction and expertise. The LLM may not significantly reduce the time or improve the quality of this task.

- E2: An LLM-powered application could potentially help by summarizing information about companies, providing insights into industry trends, or suggesting potential employers based on data analysis. However, the critical aspect of personal networking and tailored communication with employers would still heavily rely on human input and judgment.

- E3: Image capabilities would not significantly impact this task as it primarily involves text-based communication and relationship-building, which are not enhanced by image processing capabilities.
