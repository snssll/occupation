1: In this task, the main responsibility is to inspect recreational facilities for cleanliness. To complete this task, a worker would need to physically visit the facilities, visually assess the cleanliness, and potentially interact with staff or visitors to gather information. This task involves on-site inspection and human interaction, which cannot be directly replaced by an LLM. While the LLM could potentially provide guidelines or checklists for cleanliness inspections, it cannot physically inspect the facilities or interact with individuals on-site. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not involve text-based work that can be significantly expedited or improved by the LLM.
