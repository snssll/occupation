1: In this task, a recreational therapist is responsible for planning, organizing, directing, and participating in treatment programs and activities to facilitate patients' rehabilitation, help them integrate into the community, and prevent further medical problems. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves a high level of human interaction, decision-making based on individual patient needs, and hands-on activities related to organizing and participating in treatment programs. While the LLM could potentially assist in generating ideas for activities or providing general information on rehabilitation programs, the core aspects of this task require human judgment, empathy, and physical presence, which cannot be fully replaced by the LLM. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as the use of LLM or LLM-powered tools would not significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced recreational therapist to complete the task with high quality.
