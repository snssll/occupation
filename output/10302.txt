1: In this task, the crane and tower operator is required to physically manipulate levers, pedals, and dials to operate heavy machinery for lifting and moving loads. This task involves hands-on operation of equipment and requires physical presence and control over the machinery. Since the task involves physical actions and direct operation of equipment, it does not lend itself to automation or assistance from an LLM. The task cannot be completed through text input and output alone, as it requires real-time physical interaction with machinery.
