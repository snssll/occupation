1: In this task, a Librarian or Media Collections Specialist is required to search standard reference materials, including online sources and the Internet, to answer patrons' reference questions. With the help of a large language model (LLM), the librarian could potentially streamline the process of searching for information by quickly accessing and summarizing relevant data from various sources. The LLM could assist in finding accurate and up-to-date information to respond to patrons' inquiries effectively. This task involves text input (patrons' questions) and text output (answers to those questions), which aligns well with the capabilities of the LLM. Therefore, the LLM could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality, making it fall under the E1 label.
