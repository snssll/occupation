1: In this task, a Transportation Inspector is required to issue certificates of compliance for vessels without violations. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we can break down the task as follows:

- Understanding the regulations and requirements for issuing certificates of compliance: The LLM can provide information on regulations and requirements related to transportation inspections, ensuring the inspector is up to date with the necessary criteria.
- Reviewing the inspection reports for vessels: The LLM can assist in summarizing inspection reports, highlighting any violations or areas of concern that need to be addressed before issuing a certificate of compliance.
- Generating the actual certificate of compliance: The LLM can help draft the certificate based on the information provided, ensuring accuracy and compliance with standard formats.

Based on these steps, the task involves writing and transforming text according to complex instructions, providing edits to existing text following specifications, and maintaining records of written data. Therefore, this task falls under the E1 label as the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality by providing assistance in understanding regulations, summarizing reports, and generating the necessary documentation.
