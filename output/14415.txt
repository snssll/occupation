1: In this task, a Highway Maintenance Worker is responsible for removing litter and debris from roadways, including debris from rock and mud slides. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone or with additional software could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality.

- E0: This task involves physical work that cannot be automated by the LLM or any software tool. It requires manual labor, such as picking up litter and debris from roadways, which cannot be performed by the LLM.

- E1: The LLM could potentially assist in generating written reports, documenting the types of debris found, or providing safety guidelines for debris removal. However, the core task of physically removing litter and debris from roadways cannot be automated by the LLM.

- E2: While the LLM could potentially help in summarizing safety guidelines or providing information on different types of debris, it would not significantly reduce the time it takes to physically remove litter and debris from roadways. Developing additional software on top of the LLM that could automate this task is not feasible.

- E3: The task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images. Therefore, the image capabilities of the LLM would not significantly impact the completion of this task.

Based on the analysis, the most appropriate label for this task is E0.

2: E0

3: High
