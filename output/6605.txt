1: In this task, a Paper Goods Machine Setter, Operator, or Tender is required to examine completed work to detect defects, verify conformance to work orders, and adjust machinery as necessary to correct production problems. This task involves physical inspection of the paper goods, identifying defects, and making adjustments to the machinery. The task does not involve writing, summarizing, translating, or any other text-based activities that could benefit from the use of an LLM. Additionally, the task requires hands-on interaction with machinery and physical products, which cannot be performed by an LLM. Therefore, this task does not align with any of the exposure levels in the rubric.
