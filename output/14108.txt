1: In this task, a dermatologist is required to record patients' health histories. This task involves documenting information about the patient's medical background, previous skin conditions, allergies, medications, and other relevant health information. With the help of the LLM, a dermatologist could potentially streamline the process of recording and organizing this information by generating structured notes based on the patient's verbal history or medical records. The LLM could assist in summarizing and categorizing the information provided by the patient, making it easier for the dermatologist to create comprehensive health histories.

Considering the nature of the task and the capabilities of the LLM, it falls under the category of E1 exposure. The LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes for a dermatologist to record patients' health histories by providing assistance in structuring and summarizing the information effectively.
