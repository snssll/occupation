1: In this task of selecting and inviting guest speakers to speak to classes as a Library Science Teacher, Postsecondary, the exposure to LLM can be evaluated as follows:

- E0: This task involves a high degree of human interaction and decision-making based on personal judgment and relationships. The process of selecting and inviting guest speakers requires understanding the needs and interests of the students, aligning the speaker's expertise with the curriculum, and considering various factors such as availability, relevance, and credibility. LLM cannot replace the nuanced decision-making and personal touch required in this task.

- E1: While LLM can assist in generating potential guest speaker ideas based on current trends, research, and availability, the final selection and invitation process heavily rely on human judgment, networking, and communication skills. LLM can provide information on potential speakers, their expertise, and background, but the final decision-making and invitation process involve human interaction and negotiation, which cannot be fully automated.

- E2: LLM-powered applications could potentially assist in summarizing information about potential guest speakers, analyzing their relevance to the curriculum, and even suggesting suitable speakers based on past data. However, the complex nature of selecting and inviting guest speakers involves a deep understanding of the educational context, student needs, and curriculum alignment, which may require specialized domain knowledge beyond what LLM can provide.

- E3: The task of selecting and inviting guest speakers does not significantly benefit from image capabilities. This task is primarily text-based and relies on information gathering, analysis, and communication skills rather than visual content.
