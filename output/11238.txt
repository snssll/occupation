1: In this task, the occupation involves participating in recreational demonstrations to entertain resort guests. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality. Since this task involves physical participation in recreational activities, it cannot be directly completed using the LLM. The LLM cannot physically entertain guests or participate in demonstrations. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM or any tools built on top of it.

2: E0

3: High
