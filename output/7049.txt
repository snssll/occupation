1: In this task of following lesson plans designed by absent teachers, the main activities involve understanding the lesson plan, delivering the content to students, managing the classroom, and potentially adapting the plan based on the students' responses. The task does not involve complex decision-making or specialized knowledge beyond what is typically covered in teacher training programs. 

Considering the task requirements, the LLM could potentially assist by providing guidance on how to deliver specific content, suggesting engagement strategies, or offering alternative explanations for concepts. However, the task primarily involves in-person interaction, classroom management, and real-time adaptation, which are not areas where the LLM can directly intervene. While the LLM could potentially provide some support in preparing for the lesson, the actual execution and adaptation during the class would still heavily rely on the substitute teacher's real-time judgment and interaction with students.
