1: In this task, a Health and Safety Engineer is required to provide expert testimony in litigation cases. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. Providing expert testimony involves a deep understanding of health and safety regulations, standards, and practices. The task requires the engineer to communicate complex technical information clearly and effectively in a legal setting.
