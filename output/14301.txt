1: In this task, a Credit Authorizer, Checker, or Clerk is responsible for relaying credit report information to subscribers either by mail or telephone. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we can break down the task:
- The task involves communicating information from credit reports to subscribers, which can be done through written correspondence (mail) or verbal communication (telephone).
- The information relayed may include details from credit reports, such as credit scores, payment history, and other financial information.
- The task does not require specialized domain knowledge beyond understanding credit reports and relaying that information accurately to subscribers.

Based on the nature of the task, it is evident that the task involves primarily written and verbal communication. The LLM can assist in drafting written correspondence, summarizing information from credit reports, and potentially even providing scripts for telephone conversations. The LLM can also help in generating responses to common inquiries related to credit reports. Therefore, this task falls under E1 as the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality by providing assistance in writing and transforming text, providing feedback on documents, and preparing written communications.
