1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of arranging the availability of audio-visual equipment, transportation, displays, and other event needs as a Meeting, Convention, and Event Planner, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves coordinating various logistics for events, which may require accessing information, making decisions based on that information, and communicating effectively with vendors and clients.

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM can assist in writing and transforming text, providing edits, summarizing documents, answering questions, and maintaining records of written data. In this case, the LLM could potentially help draft emails to vendors or clients, summarize event requirements, or maintain records of equipment availability. However, the task also involves practical logistics that may not be easily handled by text-based interactions alone.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM itself may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to streamline the process. For example, an application could be created to search for available audio-visual equipment providers, transportation services, and display options based on specific event requirements. This software could integrate with the LLM to provide recommendations and information for decision-making.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Since the task does not involve detailed visual information or image editing, the image capabilities of the LLM would not significantly impact the completion of this task.

Based on the considerations above, the task of arranging event logistics as a Meeting, Convention, and Event Planner would likely fall under **E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications**.
