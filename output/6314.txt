1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of estimating material requirements and costs and presenting designs to clients as an Interior Designer, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be impacted by the use of the LLM.

- Interior Designers typically rely on their expertise to estimate material requirements and costs based on the design specifications. The LLM could potentially assist in providing information on current material costs, trends, and possibly even suggest design ideas based on input.
- The task of presenting designs to clients for approval involves effective communication and visualization of design concepts. The LLM could help in generating written descriptions of design concepts, drafting emails or reports, or even creating visual aids like mood boards or design presentations.

Considering the above points, the task could benefit from the LLM's capabilities in generating written content, providing information on material costs, and aiding in communication with clients. However, the task still heavily relies on the designer's creativity, expertise, and visual skills, which may not be significantly enhanced by the LLM.
