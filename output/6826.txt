1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of explaining survey objectives and procedures to interviewees and interpreting survey questions for their comprehension, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could assist in completing it. 

- The task involves explaining survey objectives and procedures, which requires clear and concise communication skills. The LLM can generate text to help articulate these explanations effectively.
- Interpreting survey questions for interviewees' comprehension may involve simplifying complex language or providing examples to aid understanding. The LLM can assist in paraphrasing and providing additional context to make the questions more accessible.
- Overall, the task involves written communication and explanation, which aligns well with the capabilities of the LLM in generating text and providing information.

Considering these points, the task can be significantly aided by the LLM, as it can help in crafting clear explanations and interpretations for interviewees, ultimately reducing the time and effort required to complete this task effectively.
