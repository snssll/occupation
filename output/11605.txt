1: In this task, a nurse midwife is required to perform physical examinations on patients. This involves taking vital signs, checking neurological reflexes, examining breasts, and performing pelvic examinations. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes for a nurse midwife to perform these physical examinations with equivalent quality.

- E0: This task involves physical interactions with patients that cannot be replaced by text-based interactions with the LLM. The LLM cannot perform physical examinations or take vital signs, so it cannot directly assist in this task.

- E1: The LLM could potentially provide information on best practices for physical examinations, guidelines for taking vital signs, or explanations of neurological reflexes. However, it cannot physically perform these tasks or provide real-time feedback on physical examinations. While it could potentially assist in preparing for examinations by providing information, the actual performance of the physical examinations still requires human interaction.

- E2: It is challenging to imagine additional software built on top of the LLM that could significantly reduce the time it takes to perform physical examinations as this task heavily relies on hands-on skills and physical interactions. While the LLM could potentially provide theoretical knowledge or guidelines, the practical aspect of physical examinations cannot be automated or significantly expedited by software.

- E3: The task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images, so the image capabilities of the LLM are not relevant in this context.
