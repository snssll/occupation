1: In this task, an Aircraft Structure, Surfaces, Rigging, and Systems Assembler is required to position and align subassemblies in jigs or fixtures based on blueprint lines and index points. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. This task involves physical manipulation of components based on precise measurements and blueprint instructions. The task does not involve writing, summarizing text, or any form of data analysis that an LLM could significantly assist with. As such, the task does not align with the capabilities of the LLM or any tools built on top of it. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not benefit from LLM exposure.

2: E0

3: High
