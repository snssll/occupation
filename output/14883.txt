1: In this task, an Animal Caretaker is required to respond to questions from patrons and provide information about animals, including behavior, habitat, breeding habits, or facility activities. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we can break down the task:
- The task involves providing information about animals, which can be done effectively by an LLM through text generation capabilities.
- The LLM can assist in crafting responses to questions from patrons by generating informative and accurate text based on the input provided.
- While the LLM can provide general information about animals, it may not have access to up-to-date facts unless explicitly mentioned in the input.
- The task does not involve any visual elements or detailed image processing, so image capabilities are not necessary.

Based on these considerations, the task can be significantly expedited and improved in quality by using the LLM to generate responses and information about animals, making it suitable for an E1 label.
