1: In this task, a Conservation Scientist is required to revisit land users to view implemented land use practices or plans. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves physical interaction and observation in the field, which cannot be directly performed by an LLM. The task also requires assessing the effectiveness of implemented land use practices, which involves real-world evaluation beyond text-based analysis. As such, this task falls under E0 as it cannot be significantly expedited or completed by an LLM or LLM-powered tool.
