1: In this task, an interpreter or translator is required to compile terminology and information to be used in translations, including technical terms such as those for legal or medical material. With access to the powerful OpenAI large language model (LLM), the interpreter or translator can significantly reduce the time it takes to compile such terminology and information. The LLM can assist in generating translations, providing definitions, and offering context for technical terms. This process can be streamlined and made more efficient with the LLM's ability to process and generate text quickly. Therefore, this task falls under E1 as the LLM can directly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality by at least half.
