1: In this task, a Labor Relations Specialist is required to select mediators or arbitrators for labor disputes or contract negotiations. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves decision-making based on expertise in labor relations, understanding the specific context of the dispute or negotiation, and considering various factors such as the skills and experience of potential mediators or arbitrators. While an LLM could potentially assist in providing information about different mediators or arbitrators based on existing data, it cannot make the final decision on who to select as that decision requires human judgment, expertise, and consideration of nuanced factors that may not be captured in data alone. Therefore, the task does not fall under E1 as it involves decision-making beyond the capabilities of the LLM. Additionally, developing software on top of the LLM to make such decisions would be complex and may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task. The task also does not involve image capabilities, so it does not fall under E3. Considering these points, the task is best classified as E2, as it is conceivable that additional software could be developed to assist in providing recommendations based on data about potential mediators or arbitrators, but the final decision-making would still require human expertise.
