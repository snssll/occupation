1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of accepting music requests from event guests as a Disc Jockey, I will consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves interacting with event guests to gather their music preferences and then playing those songs during the event. This task primarily requires human interaction and decision-making based on social cues and event atmosphere. The LLM, even with its text-based capabilities, cannot directly assist in this task as it involves real-time communication, understanding social dynamics, and making on-the-spot decisions based on guest preferences. Therefore, the task does not align with any of the exposure levels in the rubric.

2: E0
