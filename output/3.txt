1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of accepting music requests from event guests as a Disc Jockey, I will consider the capabilities of the OpenAI large language model (LLM). 

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM can assist in writing responses to music requests, generating playlists, or providing information on specific songs or artists based on the requests. This can significantly reduce the time it takes to manage music requests efficiently.
- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not reduce the time by half for this task, additional software could be developed to streamline the process further. For example, an application that organizes music requests, suggests popular songs, or integrates with music streaming services could enhance the efficiency of handling requests.
- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not relevant for this task as it primarily involves text-based interactions with event guests regarding music requests.

Based on the above analysis, I would assign the label E2 to this task.

2: E2

3: Moderate
