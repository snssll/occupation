1: For the task of using cameras in different mounts as a Camera Operator in television, video, and film production, we need to consider the exposure to LLM. In this case, the task involves physical manipulation of cameras in various mounts, which cannot be directly assisted by the LLM. The task requires hands-on operation and positioning of cameras, which is not something an LLM can assist with. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not involve text-based or image-based processing that can be significantly aided by the LLM.
