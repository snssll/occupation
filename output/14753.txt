1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of researching and studying players and teams to anticipate issues that might arise in future engagements for Umpires, Referees, and Other Sports Officials, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The LLM can assist in tasks that involve writing, summarizing, providing feedback, answering questions, and maintaining records of written data. In this case, the LLM can help in researching players and teams by providing information on their performance, statistics, and any recent developments that might impact future engagements. The model can also assist in summarizing key points and generating questions based on the research conducted. However, the task does not involve image capabilities or highly specialized domain knowledge that would require additional software beyond the LLM. Therefore, the task falls under E1 as the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the research and study aspect of the task.
