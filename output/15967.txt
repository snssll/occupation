1: In this task, the main activity involves signaling operators to guide the movement of tractor-drawn machines. To complete this task, the worker needs to have a good understanding of construction equipment operations and safety protocols. The task does not involve complex text input or output, and the context is primarily focused on physical actions and coordination on a construction site. Since the task does not involve writing, summarizing documents, analyzing text, or any other text-based activities that could benefit significantly from an LLM, it is unlikely that access to an LLM would reduce the time it takes to complete the task with high quality. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM.

2: E0
