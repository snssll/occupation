1: In this task, a Real Estate Sales Agent acts as an intermediary in negotiations between buyers and sellers. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone or with additional software could significantly reduce the time it takes for a real estate agent to act as an intermediary in negotiations. 

- E0: This task involves a high degree of human interaction and negotiation skills that are based on real-time communication, understanding of market dynamics, and personal relationships. The LLM cannot replace the nuanced judgment, empathy, and negotiation skills required in such interactions. Therefore, using the LLM alone or with additional software would not significantly reduce the time it takes for a real estate agent to perform this task.

- E1: While the LLM could potentially provide general information on negotiation tactics or real estate market trends, the core aspect of acting as an intermediary in negotiations heavily relies on human interaction, emotional intelligence, and real-time decision-making. The LLM cannot replicate these essential skills, and its use would not reduce the time significantly for a real estate agent to perform this task with equivalent quality.

- E2: It is challenging to imagine additional software built on top of the LLM that could effectively replace the role of a real estate agent in negotiations. The task involves complex human interactions, understanding of individual needs, and dynamic market conditions that are difficult to capture solely through text-based interactions with the LLM or any potential software. Therefore, the exposure to the LLM alone does not significantly reduce the time for this task.

- E3: The task of acting as an intermediary in negotiations between buyers and sellers does not involve image processing or analysis that would benefit from additional image capabilities. Therefore, the exposure to the LLM with image capabilities does not apply to this task.
