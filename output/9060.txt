1: In this task, the Gambling Change Persons and Booth Cashiers are responsible for maintaining cage security according to rules. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality. Since the task involves ensuring security compliance and adherence to rules, which may require physical presence, human judgment, and real-time decision-making, it is unlikely that the LLM can directly assist in completing this task. The LLM does not have the capability to physically secure a location or enforce rules in a physical environment. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not meet the criteria for exposure to LLM capabilities.
