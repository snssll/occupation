1: In this task, an Investment Fund Manager meets with investors to discuss investment goals and strategies. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider how the LLM could assist in this task. The LLM could potentially help in preparing materials for the meeting, such as summarizing investment strategies, generating questions that investors might ask, or providing background information on specific investment opportunities. It could also assist in drafting emails to schedule meetings or follow up with investors. However, the actual meeting itself involves human interaction, understanding nuances, and building relationships, which are not tasks that the LLM can directly handle. Therefore, while the LLM can assist in some aspects of this task, it cannot significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced Investment Fund Manager to complete the task with high quality.
