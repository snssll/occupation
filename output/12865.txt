1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of preparing, administering, and grading tests and assignments as a Kindergarten Teacher, I will consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves creating assessments, evaluating children's progress, and providing feedback. The LLM can assist in generating test questions, providing feedback on assignments, and potentially even automating some grading processes. However, the task also requires direct interaction with young children, understanding their individual progress, and providing personalized feedback, which are aspects that the LLM cannot fully replicate. While the LLM can help with some aspects of test creation and grading, the human touch and understanding required for this task may not be effectively replaced by the LLM alone.
