1: In this task, a Tire Builder inspects worn tires for faults, cracks, cuts, and nail holes to determine if they are suitable for retreading. To decide on the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves visual inspection of worn tires, which does not require specialized domain knowledge beyond what the LLM can provide.
- The task does not involve complex decision-making or precise measurements that would necessitate human judgment.
- The task primarily relies on visual observation and identification of faults, which can be described in text form for the LLM to process.
- The LLM can assist in generating reports or summaries based on the inspection findings.

Based on these considerations, the task of inspecting worn tires for faults and determining their suitability for retreading could be categorized as E1. The LLM can help in processing and analyzing the information related to tire inspection, providing a significant reduction in time required to complete the task.
