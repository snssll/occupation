1: In this task, a Cabinetmaker or Bench Carpenter is required to install hardware using hand tools. The task involves manual dexterity, precision, and knowledge of woodworking techniques. While an LLM could potentially provide information on the types of hardware to use or general guidelines for installation, the actual physical act of installing hardware using hand tools cannot be directly assisted by the LLM. The task does not involve writing, summarizing, analyzing text, or any other activity that an LLM could significantly aid in. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not benefit from LLM exposure.

2: E0
