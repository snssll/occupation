1: In this task, the occupation of a Cook in a restaurant involves baking, roasting, broiling, and steaming various types of foods. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete the task with high quality by at least half.

- E0: This task involves hands-on cooking techniques that require physical interaction with food, such as baking, roasting, broiling, and steaming. The LLM does not have the capability to physically cook or handle food, so it cannot directly assist in performing these cooking tasks.

- E1: The LLM could potentially provide recipes, cooking instructions, or tips on various cooking techniques, which could be helpful for a cook in a restaurant. However, the actual cooking process, such as monitoring temperatures, checking for doneness, and adjusting seasoning, requires hands-on experience and cannot be fully automated by the LLM.

- E2: While the LLM could potentially assist in generating new recipe ideas, suggesting flavor combinations, or providing insights on culinary trends, the core task of cooking itself is highly practical and hands-on. Additional software developed on top of the LLM may help in organizing recipes, managing inventory, or analyzing customer preferences, but it would not significantly reduce the time it takes to physically cook the food.

- E3: The task of cooking, which involves baking, roasting, broiling, and steaming, does not directly benefit from image capabilities. The LLM's text-based capabilities are not enhanced by image processing in this context.
