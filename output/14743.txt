1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of researching and controlling animal selection and breeding practices as an Animal Scientist, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it. 

- Animal selection and breeding practices involve a significant amount of research, data analysis, and decision-making based on specialized knowledge in the field of animal science.
- The LLM could assist in providing information on general animal breeding practices, historical data, and theoretical concepts related to animal genetics and breeding.
- However, the task also requires up-to-date information on current breeding practices, trends in the industry, and specific data related to different animal species, which the LLM may not be able to provide without access to real-time data sources.
- While the LLM could help generate reports, summaries, or recommendations based on the input data and research findings, it may not have the specialized domain knowledge required to make specific breeding decisions or recommendations.

Based on these considerations, the task of researching and controlling animal selection and breeding practices as an Animal Scientist would likely fall under the label E2 - Exposure by LLM-powered applications. This is because while the LLM can assist in generating information and insights, additional software or tools specifically tailored to the field of animal science would be needed to fully support the decision-making process in animal breeding practices.
