1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of computing credit terms, discounts, shipment charges, or rates for goods or services to complete billing documents for Billing and Posting Clerks, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could assist in completing it.

- E1: Direct exposure - The task involves calculations and data processing, which the LLM can assist with by providing formulas, explanations, or step-by-step guidance on how to compute credit terms, discounts, shipment charges, or rates accurately. The LLM can generate sample calculations, provide definitions, or offer suggestions on how to handle different scenarios related to billing documents.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not reduce the time significantly for this task, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to automate the computation process further. This software could potentially integrate with billing systems, databases, or other tools to streamline the billing process and ensure accuracy.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not relevant for this task as it primarily involves numerical calculations and data processing, which can be handled by the LLM through text input and output.
