1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of "Follow appropriate procedures to get copyrights for completed work" for Writers and Authors, Poets, Lyricists, and Creative Writers, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be facilitated by the use of an LLM.

- Writers and Authors, Poets, Lyricists, and Creative Writers often need to navigate legal processes to secure copyrights for their work. This task involves understanding copyright laws, filling out paperwork, and potentially communicating with legal professionals.

- An LLM could potentially assist in providing information on copyright laws and procedures, generating template documents, and even drafting correspondence related to copyright applications.

- While the LLM can provide information and generate text, the task of securing copyrights may involve nuances that require human judgment and interaction, especially when dealing with legal matters.

- The task does not involve complex visual or image processing, and the primary focus is on legal and procedural knowledge related to copyrights.
