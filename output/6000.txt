1: In this task, the occupation involves operating specialized equipment to lay and maintain railway tracks. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be significantly aided by the use of the language model. The task description involves driving vehicles that automatically move and lay tracks, which is a hands-on, physical task that does not involve text-based or knowledge-based work that can be directly assisted by an LLM. The task requires practical skills and physical operation of machinery, which cannot be substituted by text-based assistance from the LLM. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM.
