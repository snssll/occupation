1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of managing and maintaining executives' schedules as an Executive Secretary or Executive Administrative Assistant, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be impacted by the use of the LLM.

- E1: Direct exposure - The task of managing schedules involves organizing appointments, meetings, and events for executives. The LLM can assist in generating schedules, reminders, and coordinating activities efficiently through text input and output. The model can help in creating detailed schedules based on input criteria and preferences, saving time and effort for the assistant.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone can significantly aid in scheduling tasks, additional software could be developed to integrate with calendar applications, analyze executives' preferences, and provide real-time updates on changes or conflicts in schedules. This additional software could further enhance the efficiency of schedule management beyond what the LLM can achieve independently.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not relevant for the task of managing and maintaining executives' schedules as it primarily involves text-based information and coordination of activities. Therefore, image capabilities do not play a significant role in this specific task.
