1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of investigating the composition, structure, or history of the Earth's crust as a Geoscientist, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves collecting, examining, measuring, and classifying various geological materials. While the LLM can provide general information about geology, it may not have the specialized domain knowledge required to analyze specific soil, minerals, rocks, or fossil remains in detail. The task also involves hands-on fieldwork and physical measurements, which are beyond the capabilities of the LLM. Therefore, the task does not seem to benefit significantly from the LLM's text-based capabilities.
