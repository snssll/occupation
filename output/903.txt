1: In this task, a real estate broker is required to appraise property values, considering income potential when relevant. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced real estate broker to appraise property values and assess income potential. 

- The LLM can assist in providing information on real estate market trends, property values, and factors affecting income potential.
- The LLM can generate reports, summaries, and analysis based on the input data provided by the real estate broker.
- The LLM can help in researching comparable properties, rental rates, and other relevant data to aid in property appraisal.
- The LLM can assist in analyzing market data and trends to make informed assessments of income potential.

Considering these points, access to the LLM can indeed reduce the time it takes for a real estate broker to appraise property values and assess income potential, making the task more efficient and accurate.
