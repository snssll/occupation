1: In this task, a Petroleum Pump System Operator, Refinery Operator, or Gauger is required to calculate test result values using standard formulas. This task involves mathematical calculations based on standard formulas, which can be easily performed by a powerful OpenAI large language model (LLM). The LLM can quickly process the input data, apply the necessary formulas, and provide accurate test result values. Therefore, this task falls under E1 as the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the calculations with equivalent quality.
