1: In this task, the retail salesperson is responsible for renting merchandise to customers. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it. 

- The task of renting merchandise to customers involves interacting with customers, understanding their needs, explaining rental terms, processing transactions, and ensuring customer satisfaction. This task requires human interaction, decision-making, and a level of customer service that may not be easily replaced by an LLM.
- While the LLM could potentially provide information on rental terms, product details, or customer service scripts, it cannot physically interact with customers, handle transactions, or ensure customer satisfaction in the same way a human salesperson can.
- Additionally, the task may involve handling physical merchandise, setting up displays, and other activities that are outside the scope of what an LLM can do.

Based on these considerations, the task of renting merchandise to customers as a retail salesperson is best classified as E0 - No exposure to LLM.
