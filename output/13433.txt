1: In this task, a nurse midwife provides primary health care to women, including pregnancy and childbirth. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes for a nurse midwife to provide primary health care to women. The task involves a high level of human interaction, physical assessments, and medical procedures that cannot be replaced by text-based interactions with the LLM. The LLM does not have the capability to physically examine patients, provide hands-on care, or perform medical procedures. Therefore, the task falls under E0 as it requires a high degree of human interaction and physical intervention.

2: E0

3: High
