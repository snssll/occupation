1: In this task of collecting and recording animal information as an Animal Caretaker, the use of the LLM could potentially reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality. The LLM could assist in generating standardized templates for recording information, providing guidelines on best practices for data collection, and even suggesting ways to organize and store the data efficiently. The model could also help in summarizing the recorded information for easy reference or generating reports based on the collected data. Overall, the LLM could streamline the process of collecting and recording animal information, making it more efficient and accurate.

Considering the nature of the task and the potential for the LLM to significantly enhance the process, I would classify this task as E1 - Direct exposure.
