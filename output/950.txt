1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of arranging financing for property purchases as a Real Estate Broker, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be impacted by the capabilities of the LLM.

- Real Estate Brokers typically need to communicate with clients, financial institutions, and other parties to secure financing for property purchases. This task involves understanding the financial requirements of clients, negotiating terms with lenders, and ensuring all necessary documentation is in place.

- The LLM can assist in providing general information about financing options, explaining common terms and processes related to property financing, and even drafting communication materials such as emails or letters to lenders or clients.

- However, the task of arranging financing involves a high level of human interaction, negotiation, and decision-making based on specific financial circumstances. The LLM may not have access to real-time financial data or the ability to make complex financial assessments required for securing financing.
