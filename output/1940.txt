1: In this task, a Semiconductor Processing Technician is responsible for cleaning and maintaining equipment used in semiconductor processing. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be significantly aided by the use of the language model. Since the task involves physical cleaning and maintenance of equipment, it does not directly involve text input or output that the LLM can assist with. The LLM cannot physically clean or replace solutions in equipment. Therefore, the task does not align with the capabilities of the LLM, and no exposure level applies.
