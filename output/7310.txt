1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of helping develop or monitor a family schedule as a nanny, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. In this task, the nanny would typically be responsible for organizing and managing the daily activities and appointments of the family members. The LLM could potentially assist in generating schedule templates, providing suggestions for optimizing time management, or even reminding about upcoming events. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM can help in writing and transforming text related to scheduling, providing edits to existing schedules, and generating ideas for efficient time management. It can also assist in summarizing information related to the family's activities and appointments.
- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time to complete this task, additional software could be developed to integrate the LLM's capabilities with scheduling tools to automate reminders, suggest improvements based on data analysis, or even generate personalized schedules based on preferences.
- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities would not significantly impact the task of developing or monitoring a family schedule, as it primarily involves text-based information and organization rather than visual content.
