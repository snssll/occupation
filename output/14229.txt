1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of referring patients to additional medical or educational services as Audiologists, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be completed with the help of an LLM.

- Audiologists typically assess and treat patients with hearing and balance problems. Referring patients to additional services may involve understanding the patient's needs, identifying suitable services, and communicating effectively with other healthcare professionals or educators.
- An LLM could assist in generating referral letters or emails, providing information on available services, summarizing patient information for referral purposes, or even suggesting potential services based on the patient's condition.
- The task does not involve complex data analysis, specialized domain knowledge, or image processing. It primarily requires written communication and decision-making based on patient information.

Based on these considerations, the task of referring patients to additional medical or educational services as Audiologists could be classified as E1. The LLM can help in generating written content, summarizing information, and facilitating communication, thereby reducing the time needed to complete the task with equivalent quality.
