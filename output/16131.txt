1: In this task, the occupation of Tapers involves spreading and smoothing cementing material over tape to blend joints with wall surfaces. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality. 

Given that this task involves physical work such as using trowels or floating machines to work with cementing material, it falls under the category of manual labor that cannot be directly replaced by text-based tasks that an LLM can perform. The task requires physical dexterity, understanding of materials, and hands-on skills that are beyond the capabilities of the LLM. Therefore, the task does not align with any of the exposure labels (E0, E1, E2, E3) provided.

2: E0

3: High
