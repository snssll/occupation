1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of delivering advertising or illustration proofs to customers for approval as an Advertising Sales Agent, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be impacted by the use of the LLM.

- This task involves communicating with customers and presenting advertising or illustration proofs for their approval. The LLM can assist in generating text for emails or messages to accompany the proofs, providing suggestions for improving the presentation of the proofs, or even helping to draft explanations for the content of the proofs.

- The LLM can also aid in summarizing feedback from customers on the proofs, generating follow-up questions based on customer responses, or even providing insights on how to address common concerns or objections raised by customers during the approval process.

- While the LLM can enhance the communication and presentation aspects of this task, it may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task, as the core activity still involves human interaction and decision-making in the approval process.

Based on these considerations, the task of delivering advertising or illustration proofs to customers for approval as an Advertising Sales Agent would likely fall under **E2 - Exposure by LLM-powered applications**. The task could benefit from additional software developed on top of the LLM to streamline the approval process, provide recommendations based on customer feedback, or assist in analyzing customer responses to the proofs.
