1: In this task, a Shoe Machine Operator and Tender is required to remove and examine shoes, shoe parts, and designs to ensure they meet specifications. To complete this task, the operator needs to visually inspect the shoes, parts, and designs for proper embedding of stitches in channels. This task involves manual inspection and verification based on visual cues, which cannot be directly assisted by an LLM. The LLM does not have the capability to physically interact with objects or perform detailed visual inspections that require physical presence. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not benefit from the capabilities of the LLM.
