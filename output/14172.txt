1: In this task, a First-Line Supervisor of Gambling Services Workers is responsible for recording, issuing receipts for, and paying off bets. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves a significant amount of manual record-keeping and transaction processing, which could potentially be automated using the LLM to generate receipts, record bets, and calculate payouts.
- The LLM could assist in creating standardized templates for receipts, keeping track of bets, and performing calculations for payouts based on predefined rules.
- While the task involves some level of decision-making (such as verifying bets and ensuring accurate payouts), the LLM could still provide support in streamlining the administrative aspects of the task.

Based on these considerations, the task could be classified as E1 because the LLM could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task by automating the record-keeping and transaction processes, thereby improving efficiency and accuracy.
