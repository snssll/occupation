1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of discussing and planning systems with solution architects, system engineers, or cybersecurity experts as a Blockchain Engineer, we need to consider the nature of the task. This task involves a significant amount of text-based communication, collaboration, and planning. An LLM could assist in generating initial discussion points, drafting communication, summarizing key points from discussions, and providing insights based on existing knowledge of blockchain technology and related fields. The LLM could also help in researching and providing relevant information during the planning process. However, the task also requires a high level of human interaction, understanding of complex technical concepts, and real-time collaboration, which may limit the direct impact of the LLM in reducing the time significantly.
