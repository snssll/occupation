1: In this task, an Adapted Physical Education Specialist is required to write or modify individualized education plans (IEPs) for students with intellectual or physical disabilities. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM can assist in completing it. 

- Writing or modifying IEPs involves understanding the unique needs of each student, their disabilities, their progress, and the goals set for their education. This task requires a deep understanding of special education, disabilities, and educational planning.
- The LLM can assist by providing general information on writing IEPs, offering templates or examples, suggesting best practices, and potentially helping with language and structure. However, the LLM may not have the specialized knowledge required to address the specific needs of students with disabilities.
- While the LLM can provide some general guidance and support in writing or modifying IEPs, the task involves highly specialized knowledge and expertise that goes beyond what the LLM can offer. The task also requires a deep understanding of individual student needs and educational goals, which may not be effectively addressed by the LLM alone.
