1: In this task, a Highway Maintenance Worker is responsible for painting traffic control lines and placing pavement traffic messages. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. Painting traffic control lines and pavement messages involves manual labor and physical work that cannot be directly assisted by an LLM. The task requires on-site presence, physical coordination, and the ability to work with machinery. While an LLM could potentially provide information on best practices or safety guidelines for painting lines, it cannot physically perform the task itself. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not involve text-based work that can be significantly assisted by an LLM.
