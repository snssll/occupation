1: In this task, the occupation of veterinarians involves euthanizing animals. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes for a veterinarian to complete this task with high quality. 

- E0: This task involves a high degree of human interaction and ethical considerations that cannot be replaced by the LLM. Euthanizing animals requires physical presence, assessment, and decision-making that are beyond the capabilities of the LLM.
- E1: The LLM cannot physically euthanize animals or make decisions that impact the well-being of animals. While it could potentially provide information on euthanasia procedures or ethical considerations, the actual act of euthanizing animals cannot be performed by the LLM.
- E2: Developing software on top of the LLM that could assist veterinarians in decision-making processes or provide information on euthanasia procedures might be possible. However, the sensitive nature of this task and the need for human judgment make it challenging to fully automate or significantly reduce the time needed to euthanize animals.
- E3: The LLM's capabilities, even when combined with image processing, cannot physically euthanize animals or provide the necessary real-time assessment and decision-making required for this task.
