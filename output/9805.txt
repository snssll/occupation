1: In this task, a landscaping and groundskeeping worker is required to mix and apply fertilizers, herbicides, or insecticides onto grass, shrubs, or trees using sprayers or spreaders. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. This task involves physical actions such as mixing chemicals and operating sprayers or spreaders, which cannot be directly performed by an LLM. The task also requires knowledge of the appropriate chemicals to use, their proportions, and the correct application methods, which are practical skills typically acquired through training and experience in the field. Since the task involves physical actions and specialized knowledge that cannot be directly substituted by an LLM, it falls under E0.
