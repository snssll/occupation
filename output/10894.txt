1: In this task, the worker is required to operate spike pullers to remove old spikes from ties. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be significantly aided by text-based input and output capabilities of the LLM. The task itself is very hands-on and involves physical manipulation of equipment, which cannot be directly assisted by the LLM. While the LLM could potentially provide information on operating spike pullers or safety guidelines, the core task of physically operating the equipment cannot be directly influenced by the LLM. Therefore, the task does not fall under E1 as it cannot be significantly aided by the LLM alone. Additionally, developing software on top of the LLM to reduce the time it takes to operate spike pullers is not straightforward, as the task is primarily manual and physical. The LLM also does not have image capabilities that could assist in this task. Hence, the task falls under E0 as the LLM does not reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete the task with high quality.
