1: In this task, a Marketing Manager is required to develop business cases for environmental marketing strategies. To complete this task, the Marketing Manager would need to conduct research, analyze data, and create a compelling argument for implementing environmentally friendly marketing strategies. With access to the powerful OpenAI large language model (LLM), the Marketing Manager could leverage the model to gather information on current environmental trends, consumer preferences, successful case studies of environmental marketing strategies, and potential benefits for the business. The LLM could assist in generating persuasive arguments, crafting the business case, and providing insights based on the data available within its training data.

Considering the task involves researching, analyzing, and creating a persuasive business case, the LLM could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task by providing relevant information, generating content, and assisting in structuring the business case effectively. Therefore, this task falls under E1 as direct access to the LLM can reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality by at least half.
