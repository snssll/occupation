1: In this task, a Clinical and Counseling Psychologist is required to obtain and study medical, psychological, social, and family histories by interviewing individuals, couples, or families and by reviewing records. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves a significant amount of text-based work, such as conducting interviews, reviewing records, and studying histories.
- The task does not require any specialized domain knowledge that the LLM cannot provide.
- The task does not involve any visual or image-related components that would require additional capabilities beyond text processing.
- The task primarily revolves around information gathering, analysis, and documentation, which are well within the capabilities of the LLM.

Based on these considerations, the task can be significantly expedited and enhanced by using the LLM to assist in processing, analyzing, and documenting the gathered information. Therefore, this task falls under the category of E1 - Direct exposure.
