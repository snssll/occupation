1: Teaching undergraduate-level courses involves preparing lectures, creating assignments, grading student work, providing feedback, and interacting with students. With access to the powerful OpenAI large language model (LLM), a teaching assistant could potentially use the model to generate lecture materials, create assignments, provide feedback on student work, and even answer student questions. The LLM could assist in summarizing complex topics, generating quiz questions, and providing additional resources for students. However, the model may not be able to fully replace the interactive and personalized aspects of teaching, such as engaging in discussions, providing hands-on demonstrations, or offering individualized support. While the LLM can be a valuable tool for content creation and information retrieval, it may not significantly reduce the time required for all aspects of teaching undergraduate-level courses.
