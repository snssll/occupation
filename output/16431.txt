1: In this task, a Correspondence Clerk is responsible for submitting completed documents to typists for typing in final form and providing instructions on format, addresses, addressees, and the necessary number of copies. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task involves writing and transforming text, providing edits to existing text, or writing and responding to emails. The task does involve providing instructions and information in written form, which could potentially be aided by the LLM in generating clear and detailed instructions for the typists. The LLM could assist in drafting these instructions efficiently and accurately, reducing the time needed to convey the necessary information to the typists.
