1: For the task of evaluating code to ensure its validity, structure, industry standards compliance, and compatibility with browsers, devices, or operating systems, the most relevant exposure label from the rubric would be E2. While the LLM can assist in providing general information and guidelines related to coding standards and best practices, it may not significantly reduce the time it takes to evaluate specific code snippets for validity and compatibility. However, it is easy to imagine additional software being developed on top of the LLM that could analyze code more efficiently, check for specific industry standards, and provide detailed feedback on compatibility issues.

2: E2

3: Moderate
