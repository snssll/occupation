1: In this task, the occupation involves cleaning, shaping, and polishing fingernails and toenails. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes for an average worker to complete this task with equivalent quality. The task itself is hands-on and requires physical interaction with clients' nails, which cannot be replaced by text-based instructions or responses from the LLM. The LLM cannot perform physical tasks or interact with physical objects, so it cannot directly assist in cleaning, shaping, and polishing nails. Therefore, the task does not fall under E1, E2, or E3 as the LLM cannot effectively contribute to completing this hands-on task.

2: E0

3: High
