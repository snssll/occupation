1: Environmental Engineering Technologists and Technicians are responsible for assisting environmental engineers in various tasks related to environmental protection and compliance. One of the tasks they may perform is preparing permit applications or reviewing compliance with environmental permits. To determine the exposure level of this task to LLM, we need to consider whether the task involves complex decision-making, precise measurements, detailed visuals, or human interaction. In this case, preparing permit applications or reviewing compliance with environmental permits involves understanding environmental regulations, ensuring compliance with those regulations, and accurately documenting information. While the task may require some level of expertise and interpretation of regulations, it primarily involves working with text-based information and applying knowledge to specific cases. Therefore, access to an LLM could significantly reduce the time it takes to research and understand relevant regulations, draft permit applications, or review compliance documentation.
