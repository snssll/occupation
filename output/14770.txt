1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of researching information in municipal archives as a Court, Municipal, and License Clerk, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves retrieving specific information from archives based on requests. The LLM can assist in this task by providing guidance on how to search for information effectively, suggesting keywords, and potentially summarizing relevant documents. The LLM can also help in formulating responses to inquiries based on the retrieved information. However, the task may require accessing physical archives or specialized databases that the LLM alone cannot interact with. Therefore, while the LLM can aid in the information retrieval process, it may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task due to the physical nature of the archives.
