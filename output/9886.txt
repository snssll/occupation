1: In this task, a Web Administrator is required to monitor web developments through continuing education, reading, or participation in professional conferences, workshops, or groups. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we can break down the task:
- Researching and staying updated on web developments: The LLM can assist in summarizing recent trends, providing insights on new technologies, and generating questions for further exploration.
- Reading and analyzing information: The LLM can help in summarizing lengthy documents, providing feedback on articles, and generating questions for deeper understanding.
- Participating in professional conferences, workshops, or groups: The LLM can assist in preparing training materials based on general knowledge, providing counsel on issues, and maintaining records of written data related to the events attended.

Considering the capabilities of the LLM in assisting with research, analysis, and documentation tasks related to web developments, this task aligns closely with E1 exposure as the LLM can significantly reduce the time needed to stay updated and informed in the field of web administration.
