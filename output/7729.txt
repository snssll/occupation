1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of inserting cutting tools or bits into machines and securing them with wrenches for the occupation of Etchers and Engravers, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it could potentially benefit from the use of a large language model (LLM).

- E0: This task involves physical manipulation of tools and machinery, which cannot be directly assisted by an LLM. The task requires hands-on work and precise actions that cannot be replaced by text-based instructions or information provided by the LLM.

- E1: While the LLM could potentially provide written instructions on how to insert cutting tools or bits into machines, the physical aspect of securing them with wrenches cannot be directly assisted by the LLM. The task involves manual dexterity and physical interaction with machinery, which cannot be substituted by text-based guidance alone.

- E2: It is challenging to imagine additional software that could be developed on top of the LLM to significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task. The task is straightforward and primarily involves manual actions that do not lend themselves well to automation or text-based assistance beyond basic instructions.

- E3: The task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images, so the image capabilities of the LLM are not relevant in this context.

2: E0

3: High certainty
