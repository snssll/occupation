1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of assisting patients to select eyewear as an Ophthalmic Medical Technician, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be impacted by the use of the LLM.

- E0: This task involves direct interaction with patients to help them choose eyewear based on their preferences, prescriptions, and needs. It requires understanding the patient's style preferences, face shape, prescription requirements, and other factors that cannot be solely addressed through text-based interactions with the LLM. The LLM does not have the capability to physically interact with patients or assess their facial features, which are crucial in selecting appropriate eyewear.

- E1: While the LLM could potentially provide general information on different types of eyewear, trends in the industry, or basic guidelines for selecting eyewear, the task of assisting patients to select eyewear is highly personalized and requires hands-on interaction. The LLM cannot replace the personalized assistance and expertise provided by a human Ophthalmic Medical Technician in this context.

- E2: It is conceivable that additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to assist in this task by providing virtual try-on tools, personalized recommendations based on facial recognition technology, or integration with virtual reality for simulated try-ons. Such software could enhance the efficiency of the selection process, but as of now, the LLM alone does not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task.

- E3: The task of assisting patients to select eyewear does not involve image processing or analysis that would benefit from image capabilities. While visual aids may be used in the process, the core of the task revolves around human interaction and personalized recommendations rather than image-related tasks.
