1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of "Communicate with management and user personnel to develop production and design standards" for Industrial Engineers, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be aided by the use of a large language model (LLM).

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** If the task involves writing and transforming text based on complex instructions, providing edits to existing text following specifications, or generating questions for interviews or assessments, then direct access to the LLM could significantly reduce the time needed to complete the task with equivalent quality. In this case, the LLM could assist in drafting communication with management and user personnel to develop production and design standards, providing suggestions, and refining the language used in these communications.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** If additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to summarize documents longer than 2000 words, retrieve up-to-date facts, or provide recommendations based on data, then the task could potentially benefit from such capabilities. For Industrial Engineers, having access to specialized domain knowledge or complex databases through LLM-powered applications could enhance the communication process and standard development.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Since the task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images, the use of image capabilities provided by the LLM is not relevant in this context.
