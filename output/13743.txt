1: For the task of reading plans, instructions, or specifications to determine work activities as a Construction Laborer, the exposure to LLM can be evaluated as follows:

- E1: Direct exposure - The task involves reading and interpreting text, which is a straightforward application of the LLM's capabilities. The LLM can assist in understanding complex instructions, specifications, or plans, potentially reducing the time needed to comprehend them accurately.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the task may not require advanced capabilities beyond text interpretation, there could be additional software developed on top of the LLM that could enhance the process by summarizing lengthy documents, providing additional context, or offering real-time updates on construction plans.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - This task does not involve image processing or detailed visual analysis, so image capabilities provided by the LLM would not significantly impact the completion of the task.

Considering the nature of the task and the potential benefits of using the LLM for text interpretation, the most suitable label appears to be E1.

2: E1

3: Moderate
