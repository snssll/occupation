1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of writing technical papers or reports as a Chemist, we need to consider how the task can be completed with the help of an LLM. 

- Writing technical papers or reports involves synthesizing complex scientific information, organizing it logically, and presenting it in a clear and concise manner. An LLM can assist by providing information on specific topics, suggesting structures for the papers, offering language suggestions, and even generating some content based on the input provided.
- The task does not involve any visual elements or interactions that would require image capabilities.
- While the task may benefit from specialized domain knowledge, the LLM can still provide valuable assistance in generating written content and structuring the information effectively.
- The LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task by providing relevant information, suggesting formats, and even generating parts of the technical papers or reports.

Based on these considerations, the task of writing technical papers or reports as a Chemist would likely fall under the label E1 - Direct exposure.
