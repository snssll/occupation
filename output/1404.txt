1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of attending book launches and publicity events or conducting public readings as a Poet, Lyricist, or Creative Writer, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. In this task, the main activities involve physical presence at events, interacting with audiences, and performing live readings. These activities cannot be directly assisted by the LLM, as they require in-person engagement and performance skills that go beyond text-based interactions. While the LLM could potentially help in drafting promotional materials or writing speeches for such events, the core task of attending and participating in public events is not something the LLM can directly assist with.
