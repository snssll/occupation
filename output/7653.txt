1: In this task, the Advertising Sales Agents need to inform customers about available options for advertisement artwork and provide samples. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves providing information to customers about available options and showcasing samples, which primarily involves written communication. An LLM could assist in generating text to describe the available artwork options and potentially even create sample advertisements based on customer preferences. The LLM could also help in drafting email templates or written materials to present the information effectively. However, since the task does not involve complex data analysis, specialized domain knowledge, or image processing, the LLM's capabilities are mainly focused on text generation and communication. Therefore, this task aligns more closely with E1, as the LLM can significantly reduce the time needed to complete the task by providing written content and communication support.
