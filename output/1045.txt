1: In this task, the occupation of Licensed Practical and Licensed Vocational Nurses involves assembling and using medical equipment like catheters, tracheotomy tubes, or oxygen suppliers. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes for a nurse to learn how to assemble and use these medical devices. 

- E0: This task involves hands-on skills and practical knowledge that cannot be effectively substituted by text-based information from the LLM. Nurses need hands-on training and experience to safely and effectively handle medical equipment, which cannot be provided by the LLM alone.
- E1: While the LLM can provide some theoretical information about medical equipment, it cannot replace the hands-on training and experience required for this task. Assembling and using medical equipment correctly involves physical skills and real-world practice that the LLM cannot simulate.
- E2: It is conceivable that additional software could be developed to provide virtual simulations or augmented reality training for assembling and using medical equipment. Such software could leverage the LLM's capabilities to generate interactive training modules or provide step-by-step guidance. However, this software would need to incorporate hands-on elements beyond text-based instructions to be truly effective.
- E3: The task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images, so the image capabilities of the LLM are not directly relevant here.
