1: In this task, a midwife is required to maintain documentation of all patients' contacts, reviewing and updating records as necessary. With the help of the LLM, the midwife could potentially automate parts of the documentation process by generating templates for patient records, summarizing patient interactions, or even providing reminders for necessary updates. The LLM could assist in organizing and structuring the information efficiently, saving time and reducing the likelihood of errors in record-keeping. Overall, the LLM could significantly streamline the documentation process for midwives, making it more efficient and accurate.

Considering the capabilities of the LLM in assisting with writing, organizing information, and maintaining records, this task falls under the E1 category. The LLM can directly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality by at least half by providing support in generating, reviewing, and updating patient records.
