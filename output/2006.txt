1: For the task of cleaning containers, materials, supplies, or work areas, using cleaning solutions and hand tools as a Packer and Packager, Hand, we need to consider the exposure rubric to determine the appropriate label. In this case, the task involves physical cleaning using hand tools and solutions, which cannot be directly assisted by an LLM. The task does not involve complex text input or output that the LLM could significantly assist with. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not meet the criteria for exposure to LLM capabilities.
