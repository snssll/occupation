1: In this task, the occupation of Tapers involves installing metal molding at wall corners to secure wallboard. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it. 

- The task involves physical installation work that requires precise measurements and manual labor, which cannot be directly performed by the LLM.
- The task does not involve text input or output, and the context is primarily focused on physical construction rather than written instructions or information retrieval.
- While the LLM could potentially provide general information on wallboard installation techniques or safety guidelines, it cannot physically install metal molding or secure wallboard.
- There are no clear subtasks within this task that could be significantly expedited or improved by the LLM or any software built on top of it.

Based on these considerations, it is evident that the task of installing metal molding at wall corners to secure wallboard does not align with any of the exposure labels provided. The task is not text-based, does not involve information retrieval, and cannot be significantly expedited or improved by the LLM.
