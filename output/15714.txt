1: In this task, the Rock Splitters, Quarry, are responsible for setting charges of explosives to split rock. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task and whether the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete it with high quality. 

- The task of setting charges of explosives to split rock involves physical work and precise measurements, which cannot be performed by the LLM.
- The task does not involve text input or output, and the context for the task is primarily based on physical actions rather than written information.
- The LLM does not have the capability to interact with physical objects or perform tasks that require physical manipulation.
- While the LLM could potentially provide information on best practices or safety guidelines related to rock splitting, it cannot directly assist in setting charges of explosives.

Based on these considerations, the task of setting charges of explosives to split rock falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM or any tools built on top of it.

2: E0

3: High
