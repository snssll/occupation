1: In this task, a helper in the field of pipelaying, plumbing, pipefitting, or steamfitting is required to cut or drill holes in walls or floors to accommodate the passage of pipes. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if the task can be significantly expedited or improved by using the LLM or any tools built on top of it.

- E0: This task involves physical work that cannot be automated by the LLM. It requires hands-on skills and precise measurements, which are not within the capabilities of the LLM.
- E1: The LLM could potentially provide some theoretical guidance on the process of cutting or drilling holes, safety precautions, or general information about pipe installation. However, the actual physical work of cutting or drilling cannot be directly assisted by the LLM.
- E2: While the LLM could potentially provide information on specific techniques, tools, or safety guidelines related to cutting or drilling holes for pipes, it may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the physical task itself.
- E3: The task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images, so the image capabilities of the LLM are not relevant here.

Based on the above analysis, the most appropriate label for this task is E0.

2: E0

3: High
