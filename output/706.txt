1: In this task, a Sales Representative is required to answer customers' questions about products, prices, availability, product uses, and credit terms. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- E0: This task involves direct human interaction with customers, which requires interpersonal skills, empathy, and the ability to understand and address customer needs effectively. The task does not involve complex data analysis or specialized knowledge that could be significantly enhanced by an LLM.

- E1: While an LLM could potentially assist in providing scripted responses or generating information about products, prices, and availability, the task primarily relies on real-time customer interaction and personalized responses that may not be effectively replicated by an LLM alone. The nuances of customer inquiries, the need for empathy, and the ability to build rapport may not be easily handled by an LLM.

- E2: An LLM-powered application could potentially assist in summarizing product information, providing data on prices and availability, and generating responses to common customer queries. However, the task also involves understanding credit terms, which may require specialized knowledge or access to specific databases beyond the capabilities of a general LLM.

- E3: The task does not involve image capabilities, so this label is not applicable.
