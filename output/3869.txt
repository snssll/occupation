1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of counseling workers about job and career-related issues as an Industrial-Organizational Psychologist, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. In this task, the LLM could potentially assist in providing information on common job and career-related issues, offering general advice on career development, and suggesting strategies for workplace challenges. The LLM could also help generate sample scripts for counseling sessions or provide insights into common psychological theories relevant to the field. However, the task of counseling itself involves a high degree of human interaction, empathy, and personalized guidance tailored to individual needs, which the LLM may not be able to provide effectively. While the LLM can offer general information and suggestions, the nuanced and individualized nature of counseling requires human expertise.
