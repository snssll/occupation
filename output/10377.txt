1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of negotiating with retail merchants to improve product exposure, such as shelf positioning and advertising, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves written communication and negotiation skills, which can be supported by the LLM in providing guidance on effective negotiation strategies, crafting persuasive written communication, and generating responses to potential scenarios. The LLM can assist in preparing for negotiations by providing insights, suggesting approaches, and helping to draft compelling messages. However, the task also requires human judgment, adaptability to real-time interactions, and understanding of the specific context of the negotiation, which may not be fully addressed by the LLM alone. While the LLM can enhance the preparation and communication aspects of the task, the actual negotiation process may still heavily rely on human skills and intuition.
