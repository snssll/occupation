1: In this task, a glazier is responsible for cutting, fitting, installing, repairing, or replacing glass or glass substitutes in various settings. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes for a glazier to complete this task with high quality. The task of a glazier involves physical work that cannot be directly assisted by text-based tools like the LLM. The task requires hands-on skills, precise measurements, and physical labor, which cannot be substituted by text-based AI tools. Therefore, the task of a glazier falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM.

2: E0

3: High
