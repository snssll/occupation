1: In this task, the Community Health Workers are required to provide basic health services, such as first aid. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes for a worker to complete the task of providing first aid. Since providing first aid involves practical, hands-on skills and immediate action, it is unlikely that the LLM can directly assist in this task. The LLM does not have physical capabilities to administer first aid, and the task requires real-time decision-making and physical intervention, which cannot be achieved through text-based interactions with the LLM.
