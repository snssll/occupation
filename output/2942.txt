1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of conducting investigations of information security breaches as an Information Security Engineer, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves analyzing information related to security breaches, identifying vulnerabilities, and evaluating the damage caused. The LLM can assist in this task by providing information on common vulnerabilities, security best practices, and potential strategies for investigating breaches. It can also help in generating reports based on the findings of the investigation. However, the task may require specialized domain knowledge in cybersecurity, which the LLM may not possess to the same extent as a human expert. While the LLM can provide general information and guidance, it may not have the specific expertise required to conduct a thorough investigation in the field of information security.
