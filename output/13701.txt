1: In this task, a Hearing Aid Specialist is required to stay updated on developments in audiology by reading current literature, talking with colleagues, and participating in professional organizations or conferences. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be significantly expedited or improved by using the LLM. 

- Reading current literature: The LLM can help summarize and provide insights on the latest research and developments in audiology, potentially saving time compared to manually going through numerous articles.
- Talking with colleagues: The LLM can assist in generating questions or responses related to audiology that the specialist can discuss with colleagues, enhancing the quality of discussions.
- Participating in professional organizations or conferences: The LLM can help in preparing questions or materials for presentations at these events, aiding in knowledge sharing.

Considering the LLM's ability to summarize, generate questions, and provide insights, it can significantly enhance the efficiency and quality of staying updated in audiology, making this task fall under E1.
