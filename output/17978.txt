1: For the task of writing specified information in flight records as a Commercial Pilot, the exposure to LLM can be evaluated as follows:

- **E0**: This task involves physical actions such as writing down information in flight records, which cannot be directly assisted by an LLM. The task does not involve complex decision-making or specialized knowledge that would significantly benefit from LLM capabilities.

- **E1**: While the task involves writing specific information, an LLM could potentially assist in generating the text based on input data or templates. The LLM could help in ensuring accuracy and completeness of the records, reducing the time taken to manually write them.

- **E2**: With additional software development, an application could be created that integrates with the LLM to automatically populate flight records based on data inputs, reducing the time taken for manual entry. This software could also provide insights or recommendations based on the recorded data.

- **E3**: Image capabilities are not relevant for this task as it primarily involves text-based record-keeping and does not require image processing.

Based on the above analysis, the task of writing specified information in flight records for Commercial Pilots could be classified as **E2**.
