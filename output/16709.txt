1: In this task, the main responsibilities involve taking class attendance and maintaining attendance records. With the help of the LLM, a system could be developed to automate the process of taking attendance by generating attendance sheets based on input data. The LLM could also assist in organizing and maintaining attendance records efficiently. While the task itself is straightforward and does not involve complex decision-making, the automation of attendance tracking could save time and reduce the potential for errors.

Considering the capabilities of the LLM to generate text and assist in organizing data, this task could be categorized as E2. Although direct access to the LLM alone may not reduce the time it takes to complete the task by half, additional software built on top of the LLM could streamline the attendance tracking process significantly.
