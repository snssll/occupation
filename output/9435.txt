1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of making, restoring, or creating custom upholstered furniture as an upholsterer, we need to consider the level of exposure to LLM.

- E0: This task involves hands-on work with hand tools and requires physical manipulation of fabrics and furniture. LLM cannot directly assist in these physical tasks, so it would not reduce the time significantly for an experienced upholsterer to complete this task.

- E1: While LLM could potentially provide information on fabrics, upholstery methods, or design ideas, the core aspect of this task involves hands-on work with physical materials and tools. LLM may be able to offer some guidance or suggestions, but it would not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task.

- E2: LLM could be used to research new upholstery techniques, stay updated on trends in the industry, or provide design inspirations. Additionally, LLM-powered applications could potentially help in creating custom furniture designs based on input specifications. However, the physical aspect of the task, such as using hand tools and working with fabrics, would still require manual labor.

- E3: LLM combined with image capabilities could potentially assist in creating digital designs or visualizing concepts before actual fabrication. It could help in generating digital images of custom furniture designs based on descriptions provided. However, the physical work of upholstering furniture would still need to be done manually.
