1: In this task, an Air Traffic Controller is required to review records or reports for clarity and completeness and maintain records or reports as required under federal law. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes for an Air Traffic Controller to complete this task with high quality.

- Direct exposure (E1): The task involves reviewing and maintaining records, which can benefit from the LLM's ability to assist in writing and transforming text, providing edits, and maintaining written data. The LLM can help in ensuring the clarity and completeness of the reports, potentially reducing the time needed for this task.

- Exposure by LLM-powered applications (E2): While the task may not involve complex databases or highly specialized domain knowledge that would require additional software beyond the LLM, it is conceivable that software could be developed to summarize and analyze records more efficiently, thus reducing the time needed for this task.

- Exposure given image capabilities (E3): Image capabilities are not directly relevant to this task as it primarily involves reviewing and maintaining textual records and reports.

Considering the above points, the task of reviewing records or reports for clarity and completeness and maintaining records or reports aligns best with the E1 label as the LLM can directly assist in these text-based tasks.
