1: In this task, a Plasterer and Stucco Mason covers surfaces to protect them from splashing. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes for a worker to complete this task with high quality. Since this task involves physical work and does not directly involve text input or output, it is unlikely that the LLM or any LLM-powered tool can assist in completing this task. The task requires manual labor and does not involve writing, analyzing text, or making decisions based on text. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM.

2: E0

3: High
