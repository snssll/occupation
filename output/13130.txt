1: In this task, the occupation involves farmworkers protecting herds from predators using trained dogs. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality. 

- The task involves physical work and interaction with animals, which cannot be directly assisted by the LLM.
- The task requires practical skills in handling trained dogs and dealing with real-life situations on a farm, which the LLM cannot provide guidance on.
- The LLM does not have the capability to assist in physical tasks or provide real-time support in animal handling.

Based on these considerations, it is clear that the task of protecting herds from predators using trained dogs falls under E0 as it involves physical work and real-life interactions that cannot be significantly aided by the LLM.

2: E0

3: High
