1: In this task, a Social and Human Service Assistant is required to provide information or refer individuals to public or private agencies or community services for assistance. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves providing information and making referrals based on the individual's needs, which can be done effectively through text-based communication.
- The task does not require specialized domain knowledge beyond what the LLM can provide.
- The task does not involve complex databases, highly specialized knowledge, or detailed image analysis.
- The task primarily involves written communication and decision-making based on the information provided.

Based on these considerations, the task can be effectively completed with the help of the LLM, as it can assist in generating appropriate responses, providing information, and suggesting referrals based on the input data. Therefore, the task falls under label E1 - Direct exposure.
