1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of "Direct and participate in institutional fundraising activities, and encourage alumni participation in such activities" for Education Administrators, Postsecondary, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be facilitated by the use of an LLM.

- E1: Direct exposure - If the task involves writing fundraising proposals, drafting emails to alumni, creating fundraising campaign materials, or providing guidance on effective communication strategies to encourage alumni participation, the LLM could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete these tasks with equivalent quality. The LLM can assist in generating persuasive and engaging content, summarizing data for proposals, and even drafting responses to potential questions or concerns from alumni.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not reduce the time it takes to complete the task by half, additional software built on top of the LLM could enhance the process. For example, an application that can analyze donor data to provide personalized fundraising strategies, or a tool that can generate detailed reports on alumni engagement based on input data could be developed to streamline the fundraising activities.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities would not significantly impact the task of fundraising activities and alumni engagement in this context, as the task primarily involves written communication and strategic planning rather than image-related tasks.
