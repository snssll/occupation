1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of ordering supplies for facilities as a Residential Advisor, we need to consider the level of exposure to LLM. 

- E1: Direct exposure - If the task involves writing and transforming text to place orders, providing edits to existing supply lists, or generating emails to suppliers, the LLM could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality by at least half. The LLM can assist in drafting emails, creating supply lists, and even suggesting suppliers based on previous interactions or data.
  
- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the task may not be reduced by half with just the LLM, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to streamline the process. This software could include features like automatically checking inventory levels, suggesting optimal quantities to order, or integrating with suppliers' systems for seamless ordering.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities would not significantly impact the task of ordering supplies for facilities, as it primarily involves text-based communication with suppliers and managing inventory lists.

Considering the nature of the task, the most suitable label appears to be E2. While the LLM alone may not reduce the time to complete the task by half, the development of additional software leveraging the LLM's capabilities could enhance the efficiency of the supply ordering process for Residential Advisors.
