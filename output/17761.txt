1: In this task, a Cooling and Freezing Equipment Operator and Tender is required to weigh packages and adjust freezer air valves or switches to ensure that specified amounts of product are placed in each container. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. This task involves physical actions such as weighing packages and adjusting equipment settings, which cannot be directly performed by an LLM. The task does not involve complex text input or output, and the context is more related to physical operations rather than information processing. Therefore, the task does not align with the capabilities of an LLM or any tools built on top of it. As a result, this task falls under E0 as it does not benefit from LLM exposure.

2: E0
