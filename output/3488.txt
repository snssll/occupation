1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of consulting with customers or other departments on project status, proposals, or technical issues as a Software Developer, we need to consider the level of exposure to LLM. In this task, the Software Developer would likely need to communicate effectively, provide technical explanations, and potentially draft proposals or reports. The LLM could assist in generating written responses, drafting technical documentation, or even providing suggestions for project status updates. However, the task involves direct interaction with customers or departments, which may require a nuanced understanding of specific project details and interpersonal skills that the LLM may not fully capture. While the LLM could aid in drafting written materials, it may not significantly reduce the time it takes to consult with stakeholders due to the interactive and dynamic nature of such discussions.
