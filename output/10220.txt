1: In this task, a Biofuels Production Manager is responsible for monitoring the transportation and storage of flammable or potentially dangerous feedstocks or products to ensure safety guidelines are followed. To complete this task, the manager needs to have a good understanding of safety protocols, regulations, and best practices in handling such materials. The task involves overseeing logistics, ensuring compliance with safety standards, and taking corrective actions if necessary.

To determine the exposure label for this task:
- The task involves monitoring and ensuring safety compliance, which requires knowledge of regulations and protocols. The LLM can provide information on safety guidelines, regulations, and best practices related to handling flammable materials.
