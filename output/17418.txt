1: In this task, the Drilling and Boring Machine Tool Setters, Operators, and Tenders, Metal and Plastic are required to turn valves and direct the flow of coolants or cutting oil over cutting areas. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. This task involves physical actions such as turning valves and directing the flow of fluids, which cannot be directly performed by an LLM. The task does not involve complex decision-making, analysis, or information retrieval that would significantly benefit from LLM capabilities. Therefore, this task does not align with any of the exposure levels in the rubric.

2: E0

3: High
