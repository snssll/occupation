1: In this task, a Counter and Rental Clerk is responsible for keeping records of transactions and the number of customers entering an establishment. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves recording data related to transactions and customer traffic, which primarily involves text-based information. An LLM could potentially assist in automating the process of recording and organizing this data, which would save time and reduce the likelihood of errors compared to manual record-keeping. The LLM could generate reports, summaries, or even analyze trends based on the recorded data. However, since the task does not involve complex analysis, specialized domain knowledge, or image processing, the LLM's role would be limited to text-based data processing and organization.
