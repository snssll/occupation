1: In this task, the roofer attaches roofing paper to roofs in overlapping strips to create a base for other materials. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes for a roofer to complete this task with high quality. The task of attaching roofing paper involves physical labor, precise measurements, and hands-on work that cannot be replaced by text-based instructions or information provided by the LLM. The task does not involve writing, summarizing documents, analyzing text, or any other activity that the LLM could directly assist with. Therefore, the task does not align with any of the exposure labels provided.
