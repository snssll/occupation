1: In this task, a First-Line Supervisor of Housekeeping and Janitorial Workers is responsible for checking and maintaining equipment to ensure it is in working order. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves routine maintenance and inspection of equipment, which may not require highly specialized domain knowledge beyond general knowledge of equipment used in housekeeping and janitorial work.
- The task does not involve complex decision-making or analysis beyond ensuring equipment functionality.
- The task is primarily focused on physical equipment rather than text-based or image-based information.
- While the task may involve some written documentation of maintenance checks, the core activity is physical inspection and maintenance.

Based on these considerations, the task does not significantly benefit from the capabilities of an LLM or additional software tools. The task does not involve text-based analysis, complex decision-making, or specialized domain knowledge that would require LLM assistance. Therefore, this task is best classified as E0.
