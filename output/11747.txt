1: In this task, a cardiologist is required to perform vascular procedures like balloon angioplasty and stents. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes for a cardiologist to perform these procedures with equivalent quality. 

- E0: This task involves hands-on medical procedures that require precise skills and physical interaction with patients. The LLM cannot physically perform these procedures or provide real-time guidance during the process. Therefore, the task cannot be completed solely with the LLM.
- E1: While the LLM can provide information on vascular procedures, it cannot physically perform them. The task of performing balloon angioplasty and stents involves practical skills, precision, and patient interaction, which the LLM cannot replicate. Thus, the task cannot be completed with equivalent quality solely by using the LLM.
- E2: It is conceivable that software could be developed to assist cardiologists by providing up-to-date information on vascular procedures, offering recommendations based on the latest research, or even simulating virtual training scenarios. However, this software would need to go beyond the capabilities of the LLM alone and integrate with other tools to provide practical assistance in performing vascular procedures.
- E3: The LLM, combined with image capabilities, could potentially assist in creating educational materials or providing information on vascular procedures through text or image-based content. However, this would not directly aid in physically performing the procedures themselves.
