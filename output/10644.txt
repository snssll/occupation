1: In this task, the Funeral Home Manager is required to offer counsel and comfort to families and friends of the deceased. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality. The task involves providing emotional support, empathy, and guidance to individuals who are grieving, which are highly human-centric skills that require a deep understanding of emotions and interpersonal dynamics. While the LLM can provide information on grief counseling techniques or sample scripts for consoling individuals, the essence of offering genuine comfort and empathy is a deeply human aspect that cannot be fully replicated by an AI model. Therefore, the task falls under E0 as it does not significantly benefit from the capabilities of the LLM.
