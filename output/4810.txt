1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of developing approaches to the solution of groups' problems as a Sociologist, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be aided by the use of a large language model (LLM).

- Sociologists typically rely on research findings in sociology and related disciplines to develop approaches to solve groups' problems. An LLM can assist in this task by providing access to a vast amount of information, research papers, and data related to sociology and other relevant fields.
- The LLM can help in summarizing research findings, generating new ideas based on existing knowledge, and even suggesting potential solutions based on the input provided.
- While the LLM can be a valuable tool in aiding the research process and generating insights, the task of developing approaches to solve groups' problems also requires critical thinking, analysis, and domain expertise, which may not be fully replaced by the LLM alone.
- The LLM can significantly reduce the time required to gather information, analyze data, and propose initial solutions, but the final decision-making and implementation of these approaches may still heavily rely on the expertise of the Sociologist.
