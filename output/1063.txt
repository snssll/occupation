1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of assembling fiber optical, optoelectronic, or free-space optics components as a Photonics Technician, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be impacted by the use of a large language model (LLM).

- Assembling components in photonics involves technical knowledge, precision, and hands-on skills. The task requires physical manipulation of delicate components, alignment, and testing, which cannot be directly assisted by an LLM.
- While an LLM could potentially provide written instructions, guidelines, or troubleshooting tips for assembly, the core task of physically assembling components would still rely heavily on manual dexterity and technical expertise.
- The task does not involve extensive written communication, data analysis, or information retrieval that could be significantly enhanced by an LLM.
- The task does not involve image processing or detailed visual analysis that would benefit from image capabilities in conjunction with an LLM.

Based on these considerations, the task of assembling photonics components would be classified as E0 - No exposure to LLM.
