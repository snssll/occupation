1: In this task, the Electrical and Electronics Repairers are required to test oil in circuit breakers and transformers for dielectric strength and refill oil periodically. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be significantly aided by the use of the language model. The task involves technical knowledge and skills related to electrical systems, testing procedures, and maintenance practices. While the LLM can provide information on general electrical concepts and procedures, it may not have the specific domain knowledge required for testing oil in circuit breakers and transformers. The task also involves physical actions such as refilling oil, which cannot be performed by the LLM. Therefore, the task does not seem to benefit significantly from the use of the LLM in reducing the time it takes to complete the task.
