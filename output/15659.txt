1: In this task, a school psychologist is required to serve as a resource to help families and schools deal with crises, such as separation and loss. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves providing support, guidance, and counseling to individuals experiencing crises, which requires a high level of human interaction, empathy, and emotional intelligence. While an LLM can provide general information and guidance on dealing with crises, the nuanced and personalized support needed in such situations is best provided by a human with specialized training in psychology. The task also involves understanding complex emotions, individual circumstances, and tailoring interventions accordingly, which may not be effectively addressed by an LLM. Therefore, the task falls under E0 as it requires a high degree of human interaction and specialized expertise that cannot be effectively replaced by an LLM.
