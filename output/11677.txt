1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of performing securities valuation or pricing as a Financial and Investment Analyst, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM in assisting with this task. 

- E0: This task involves complex financial analysis and requires specialized domain knowledge in finance and investment. The LLM may not have the specific expertise or access to real-time financial data necessary to accurately perform securities valuation or pricing without human intervention. Therefore, it is unlikely that the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced financial analyst to complete this task.

- E1: While the LLM can provide general information on financial concepts and potentially assist in generating reports or summaries related to securities, the task of securities valuation or pricing requires in-depth financial modeling, understanding of market trends, and access to real-time data. The LLM may not have the capability to access up-to-date financial information or perform the complex calculations required for accurate valuation.

- E2: It is conceivable that additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to assist with securities valuation or pricing by integrating real-time financial data feeds, advanced financial modeling tools, and market analysis algorithms. This software could potentially enhance the LLM's capabilities and reduce the time required for financial analysts to perform these tasks.

- E3: The task of securities valuation or pricing does not involve image processing or visual data, so the image capabilities of the LLM are not relevant in this context.

Based on the above considerations, the most appropriate label for this task is E2.

2: E2

3: Moderate
