1: In this task, a Food Preparation Worker is responsible for informing supervisors about equipment issues, low food and supply levels, and ordering necessary items. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves written communication to report specific issues and take action accordingly. An LLM can assist in drafting clear and concise messages to inform supervisors about equipment malfunctions and low inventory levels. The model can also help in generating the necessary order requests for items that need to be replenished. Since the task primarily involves written communication and documentation, the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality. Therefore, this task falls under E1 as direct access to the LLM can streamline the process of informing supervisors and ordering items.
