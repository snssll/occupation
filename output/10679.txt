1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of opening, sorting, and distributing incoming mail as a Courier or Messenger, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. In this task, the LLM could potentially assist in generating instructions for sorting mail based on predefined criteria, providing templates for organizing mail efficiently, or even suggesting best practices for mail distribution. The LLM could also help in creating training materials for new employees on how to handle incoming mail effectively. However, since this task primarily involves physical actions such as handling physical mail items, it is unlikely that the LLM alone or tools built on top of it could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with high quality. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not clearly decrease the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete the task with high quality by at least half.
