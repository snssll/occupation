1: In this task, a Community Health Worker is required to refer community members to needed health services. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves understanding the health needs of community members and matching them with appropriate health services. This requires knowledge of available health services, community resources, and the ability to communicate effectively with individuals to assess their needs.
- The task does not involve complex data analysis, specialized domain knowledge, or the need for image capabilities.
- While the task may benefit from access to information about specific health services or resources, the task itself is primarily focused on communication and referral.

Based on these considerations, the task of referring community members to needed health services would likely fall under E0 as it does not significantly benefit from the capabilities of an LLM or additional software beyond what is commonly available.
