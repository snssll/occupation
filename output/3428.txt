1: In this task, a Brickmason or Blockmason is responsible for constructing corners by fastening a corner pole or building a corner pyramid of bricks and filling in between the corners using a line as a guide. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality. Since this task involves physical construction work that requires hands-on skills, precise measurements, and manual labor, it is unlikely that the LLM can directly assist in completing the task. The LLM does not have the capability to perform physical construction tasks or provide real-time guidance for hands-on work. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not meet the criteria for exposure to LLM capabilities.
