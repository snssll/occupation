1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of studying historical climate change indicators as a Geoscientist, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it. 

- Geoscientists studying historical climate change indicators rely on analyzing complex data from various sources such as ice sheets and rock formations.
- The task involves interpreting and synthesizing large amounts of data to develop climate change models.
- The LLM could assist in providing information on historical climate change indicators, scientific theories, and data analysis techniques.
- The LLM could help in summarizing research papers, providing background information on climate change, and generating initial hypotheses based on the data provided.
- However, the task also requires specialized domain knowledge, data analysis skills, and the ability to interpret complex geological data accurately.

Based on these considerations, the task of studying historical climate change indicators as a Geoscientist would likely fall under **E2 - Exposure by LLM-powered applications**. While the LLM could provide valuable information and assist in certain aspects of the task, additional software specifically tailored to geoscientific data analysis and interpretation would be needed to significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task.
