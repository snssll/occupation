1: In this task, the occupation involves attending to locker rooms, coatrooms, and dressing rooms. The specific task mentioned is collecting soiled linen or clothing for laundering. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if the task can be significantly expedited or improved by using the LLM. Collecting soiled linen or clothing for laundering is a physical task that involves manual labor and interaction with physical objects. The task does not involve complex text input or output, and the context is straightforward. The LLM cannot physically collect items or interact with the environment, so it cannot directly assist in completing this task. Therefore, the task does not fall under E1, E2, or E3 exposure labels.
