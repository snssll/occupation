1: In this task, a Museum Technician or Conservator is required to build, repair, and install wooden steps, scaffolds, and walkways to improve access to or provide a better view of exhibited equipment. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. Since the task involves physical construction work such as building and repairing wooden structures, it does not directly involve text input or output that can be processed by an LLM. The task also requires hands-on skills and physical labor, which cannot be performed by an LLM. Therefore, the task does not align with the capabilities of an LLM, and there are no tools built on top of the LLM that can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task. As a result, this task falls under E0 as it does not benefit from LLM exposure.

2: E0

3: High
