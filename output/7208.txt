1: In this task, a recreation worker is required to greet new arrivals to activities, introduce them to other participants, explain facility rules, and encourage participation. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves human interaction, communication skills, and the ability to engage with individuals in a recreational setting. While an LLM could potentially provide some guidance on how to greet new arrivals, explain rules, and encourage participation through text-based suggestions, the core aspect of this task involves direct human interaction and engagement, which cannot be fully replaced by an LLM. The nuances of social interaction, empathy, and adaptability required in this task are best handled by a human. Therefore, the task falls under E0 as it does not significantly benefit from LLM assistance in completing the task.
