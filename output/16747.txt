1: In this task, the Radio, Cellular, and Tower Equipment Installers and Repairers are required to take site survey photos or photos of work performed using digital cameras. With access to the LLM, the task could potentially be streamlined by generating reports or documentation based on the images taken. The LLM could assist in automatically captioning the images, summarizing the content of the photos, or even generating reports based on the visual data. However, the task does not involve detailed image analysis or require complex image editing. Therefore, the LLM's image capabilities could provide some assistance in processing the visual data but may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task.
