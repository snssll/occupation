1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of studying books, pictures, or examples of period clothing to determine styles worn during specific periods in history as a Costume Attendant, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves researching historical fashion trends and styles, which can be done by reading and analyzing text and images. The LLM can assist in summarizing historical texts, providing information on specific historical periods, and potentially even generating descriptions of period clothing based on the input provided. While the LLM may not have direct access to images for analysis, it can still provide valuable insights and information based on the text input.

Considering the task's reliance on text and image analysis, the LLM's ability to summarize information, provide historical context, and potentially generate descriptions aligns with exposure level E1. The LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to gather relevant information and insights related to historical fashion trends, thereby enhancing the efficiency of a Costume Attendant in their research.
