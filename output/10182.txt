1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of monitoring system operation to detect potential problems for Computer Systems Engineers/Architects, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. In this task, the LLM could potentially assist by providing guidance on common system issues, suggesting troubleshooting steps, or even generating reports based on system data analysis. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM can help in writing and transforming text related to system monitoring, providing edits to reports, and possibly even suggesting solutions based on the input data. This direct access to the LLM could significantly reduce the time needed to complete the task with equivalent quality.
- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not reduce the time by half for this task, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to summarize system logs, analyze trends, and provide real-time alerts for potential problems. This additional software could enhance the efficiency of system monitoring.
- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not directly relevant to monitoring system operation, so this label does not apply to this task.

Based on the above analysis, the most fitting label for this task is E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications.

2: E2

3: Moderate
