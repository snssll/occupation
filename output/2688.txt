1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of completing forms in accordance with company procedures for Secretaries and Administrative Assistants, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be impacted by the use of an LLM.

- Completing forms in accordance with company procedures involves understanding the specific requirements of each form, following guidelines accurately, and ensuring that the information provided is correct and formatted appropriately.
- An LLM could potentially assist by providing guidance on how to fill out specific sections of a form, suggesting language or phrasing, or even generating responses based on input data.
- The task does not involve complex decision-making, highly specialized knowledge, or the need for up-to-date facts beyond what is provided in the company procedures.
- While an LLM could potentially help with generating text or providing suggestions, the task itself is relatively straightforward and does not require extensive language processing or analysis beyond what a human worker could reasonably do.

Based on these considerations, the task of completing forms in accordance with company procedures for Secretaries and Administrative Assistants could be classified as E1, as direct access to an LLM could reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality by at least half.
