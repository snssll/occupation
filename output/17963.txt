1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of writing reports or proposals related to photonics research or development projects as a Photonics Engineer, we need to consider the level of exposure to LLM.

- E1: Direct exposure - If the task involves writing and transforming text according to complex instructions, providing edits to existing text following specifications, or preparing training materials based on general knowledge, then direct access to the LLM could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality.
- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - If additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to summarize documents longer than 2000 words, retrieve up-to-date facts from the Internet, or provide counsel on highly specialized issues related to photonics, then the task could be completed more efficiently.
- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Since the task specifically involves writing reports or proposals, which are text-based, and does not require image processing or analysis, the image capabilities of the LLM would not significantly impact the completion of this task.

Considering the nature of the task as primarily text-based and not requiring image capabilities, the most appropriate label appears to be E2, as developing additional software on top of the LLM could enhance the efficiency of completing reports or proposals related to photonics research or development projects.
