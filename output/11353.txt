1: In this task, a Court, Municipal, and License Clerk is required to perform administrative tasks such as answering telephone calls, filing court documents, and maintaining office supplies or equipment. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete these administrative tasks. 

- Answering telephone calls: The LLM could potentially assist in drafting responses to common inquiries or providing information based on predefined scripts, which could save time.
- Filing court documents: The LLM could help in organizing and categorizing documents, generating labels, or even suggesting filing systems, which could be beneficial.
- Maintaining office supplies or equipment: The LLM may not have a direct impact on this task as it involves physical organization and management.

Considering the potential assistance the LLM can provide in drafting responses, organizing documents, and possibly suggesting efficient office supply management strategies, this task could be classified as E1.
