1: In this task, a Musical Instrument Repairer and Tuner adjusts string tensions to tune instruments using hand tools and electronic tuning devices. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. Adjusting string tensions and tuning instruments involve a hands-on approach that requires physical manipulation of the instruments. While an LLM could potentially provide information on tuning techniques or troubleshooting tips, the actual tuning process itself is a manual task that cannot be directly performed by the LLM. Therefore, the task does not involve text-based inputs or outputs that the LLM can significantly assist with. As a result, the task falls under E0 as it does not meet the criteria for exposure to LLM capabilities.

2: E0

3: High
