1: In this task, the self-enrichment teacher is conducting classes, workshops, and demonstrations to teach various topics and skills. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced self-enrichment teacher to complete this task with high quality. The task involves hands-on teaching, demonstrations, and interactions with students, which are not text-based activities that can be directly assisted by the LLM. While the LLM could potentially help in preparing written materials, lesson plans, or answering questions related to the topics being taught, the core aspect of teaching through physical demonstrations and interactions with students cannot be directly facilitated by the LLM.
