1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of conducting research on the structures and properties of materials as a Materials Scientist, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be supported by the capabilities of the LLM.

- Conducting research on materials involves analyzing complex scientific data, understanding material properties, and exploring potential applications. The LLM can assist in providing background information, definitions, explanations, and potentially even some basic analysis based on existing knowledge within its training data.
- The task may involve reviewing scientific papers, experimental results, and technical reports to gather information. The LLM can help summarize these documents, answer questions about them, and even generate questions for further investigation.
- While the LLM can provide general information and insights related to materials science, it may not have access to highly specialized domain knowledge or the ability to retrieve up-to-date facts from recent research publications unless explicitly provided in the input.
- The task does not involve detailed visual analysis or require physical interactions, making it suitable for text-based support from the LLM.

Based on these considerations, the task of conducting research on the structures and properties of materials as a Materials Scientist would likely fall under **E2 - Exposure by LLM-powered applications**. While the LLM can provide valuable support in terms of information retrieval, summarization, and basic analysis, additional software tailored to the specific domain of materials science could further enhance the efficiency of the research process.
