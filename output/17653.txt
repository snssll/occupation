1: In this task, Transportation Security Screeners are required to view images of checked bags and cargo using remote screening equipment and alert baggage screeners or handlers to any possible problems. With the capabilities of the LLM, it is possible to develop software that can assist in analyzing these images, identifying potential issues, and providing recommendations based on the analysis. This would involve the LLM-powered application being able to interpret the images, detect anomalies, and suggest appropriate actions to the screeners. As this task involves analyzing images and providing insights based on them, it falls under the E3 category as the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with the additional image capabilities.
