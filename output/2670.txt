1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of completing and maintaining assessment rolls for all property in a municipality as an Appraiser and Assessor of Real Estate, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be impacted by the use of an LLM.

- The task involves organizing and updating information related to property assessments, which requires a significant amount of data management and record-keeping.
- An LLM could potentially assist in generating reports, summarizing data, and even providing insights based on the information provided.
- While the task involves dealing with specific data related to property assessments, it may not require real-time up-to-date information from the internet, as the assessments are likely based on existing property values and records.
- The task does not involve detailed visual analysis or interactions that would require physical presence or precise measurements.

Considering these points, the task could benefit from the use of an LLM to assist in organizing, summarizing, and potentially analyzing the data related to property assessments. However, the task does not involve highly specialized domain knowledge or complex databases that would require additional software beyond the capabilities of an LLM. Therefore, the task aligns best with label E1 - Direct exposure.
