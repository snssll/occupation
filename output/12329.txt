1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of preparing and implementing remedial programs for students requiring extra help as a Secondary School Teacher, we need to consider the nature of the task. This task involves creating educational programs tailored to individual students' needs, which may require research, planning, and instructional design. The task primarily involves writing and transforming text to develop these programs. The LLM can assist in generating ideas, drafting program outlines, providing educational resources, and suggesting effective teaching strategies. While the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task, additional software could be developed to streamline the process by offering personalized program templates, curriculum suggestions, and instructional materials based on the latest educational research.
