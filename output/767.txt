1: In this task, a Tile and Stone Setter applies a sealer to make grout stain- and water-resistant. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality. The task involves a physical action of applying a sealer, which cannot be done through text input and output alone. The LLM cannot physically interact with materials, so it cannot directly assist in applying the sealer. Therefore, the task does not fall under E1, E2, or E3 as the LLM cannot perform the essential action required for this task.

2: E0

3: High
