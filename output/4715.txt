1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of determining research topics for historians, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. Historians typically rely on extensive research, analysis of historical documents, and critical thinking to identify relevant topics. The LLM can assist by providing information on historical events, figures, and contexts, as well as generating potential research questions based on existing knowledge. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM can help historians by providing background information, suggesting research directions, and assisting in formulating research questions. Historians can leverage the LLM to streamline the initial stages of topic selection, potentially reducing the time needed to identify research areas.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time required for historians to determine research topics, additional software could be developed to summarize vast amounts of historical data, analyze trends, and provide recommendations based on existing knowledge. Such tools could enhance the efficiency of topic selection for historians.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not directly relevant to the task of determining research topics for historians, as it primarily involves text-based research and analysis. Therefore, this task does not fall under E3.

Based on the above analysis, the task of determining research topics for historians aligns best with label E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications.

2: E2

3: Moderate
