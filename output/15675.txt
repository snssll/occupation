1: In this task, the Dining Room and Cafeteria Attendants and Bartender Helpers are responsible for serving items like ice water, coffee, rolls, or butter to patrons. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. Serving these items involves basic actions that do not require complex decision-making or specialized knowledge beyond standard service protocols. The task primarily involves following a set procedure and interacting with patrons in a courteous manner. Since the task does not involve complex data analysis, specialized domain knowledge, or detailed documentation, it is unlikely that access to an LLM would significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not meet the criteria for exposure to LLM capabilities.
