- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time it takes to administer online purchasing systems, additional software built on top of the LLM could enhance this process. For example, an application that integrates the LLM's capabilities with data retrieval from online purchasing platforms to analyze trends, make recommendations for cost-saving measures, or generate reports could streamline the task.
