1: In this task, a Maintenance and Repair Worker is required to assemble boilers at installation sites using various tools. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality. 

Given the nature of the task, which involves physical work with tools and equipment, it is unlikely that the LLM or any tools built on top of it can directly assist in assembling boilers at installation sites. The task requires hands-on skills, knowledge of tools, and physical labor, which cannot be replaced by text-based AI models. Therefore, the task falls under E0 as it does not meet the criteria for exposure to LLM capabilities.
