1: In this task, a Phlebotomist is required to perform saline flushes or dispense anticoagulant drugs through IV lines under the direction of a medical doctor. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if access to the LLM or LLM-powered tools can significantly reduce the time it takes for a Phlebotomist to complete this task with high quality.

- E0: This task involves hands-on medical procedures that require precise skills and adherence to licensing restrictions. The task also involves direct interaction with patients and medical professionals, which cannot be replaced by text-based tools like the LLM.

- E1: The task of performing medical procedures like saline flushes and dispensing drugs through IV lines is highly specialized and requires practical skills that cannot be substituted by text-based tools alone. While the LLM can provide information on medical procedures, it cannot physically perform the tasks required in this occupation.

- E2: While it is conceivable that software could be developed to assist Phlebotomists in certain aspects of their work, such as providing information on drug interactions or procedural guidelines, the core tasks of performing saline flushes and dispensing drugs through IV lines still require hands-on skills that cannot be fully automated by the LLM.

- E3: The task does not involve image processing or analysis that would benefit from additional image capabilities alongside the LLM.

2: E0

3: High
