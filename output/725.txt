1: In this task, a First-Line Supervisor of Gambling Services Workers is required to answer patrons' questions about gaming machine functions and payouts. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves answering questions related to gaming machine functions and payouts, which can be effectively addressed by an LLM through text input and output.
- The LLM can provide accurate and up-to-date information based on the context provided within the 2000-word limit.
- The task does not involve precise measurements, detailed visuals, or physical interactions, making it suitable for text-based processing by the LLM.

Considering these points, the task can be significantly expedited and completed with equivalent quality by utilizing the LLM's capabilities. Therefore, this task falls under the E1 exposure label.
