1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of reading manuals, periodicals, and technical reports to learn how to develop programs as a Computer Systems Analyst, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves processing and understanding technical information from written sources, which aligns with the LLM's ability to read and comprehend text. The LLM can assist in summarizing and extracting key information from these documents, potentially saving time for the analyst in digesting large amounts of information. However, the task does not involve complex decision-making, specialized domain knowledge retrieval, or image processing, which would warrant a higher exposure label. Therefore, the task falls under E1 as the LLM can significantly reduce the time needed to process and understand technical documents.
