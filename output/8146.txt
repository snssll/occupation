1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of installing new hardware or software systems as a Computer Network Support Specialist, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. In this task, the LLM could potentially assist by providing detailed step-by-step instructions for installing hardware or software systems, troubleshooting common integration issues, or generating documentation for the integration process. The LLM could also help in summarizing technical manuals or guidelines related to specific hardware or software components. However, since this task involves hands-on technical work and physical installation, the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with high quality. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not meet the criteria for E1, E2, or E3 exposure levels.
