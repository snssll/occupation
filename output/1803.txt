1: In this task, the Appraisers and Assessors of Real Estate need to check building codes and zoning bylaws to understand how they may impact the properties they are appraising. To complete this task, the appraisers would typically need to review legal documents, regulations, and potentially consult with local authorities to ensure compliance. While an LLM could potentially assist in summarizing building codes and zoning bylaws, it may not have direct access to up-to-date information or specialized local regulations that could impact the appraisal process. The task also involves interpreting complex legal language and understanding the implications for property values, which may require domain-specific knowledge beyond what the LLM can provide. Therefore, the task does not seem to fit neatly into any of the exposure levels, as it involves a high degree of domain expertise and real-time information that the LLM alone may not be able to provide efficiently.
