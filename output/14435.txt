1: In this task, an Aircraft Mechanic or Service Technician is required to remove or install aircraft engines using hoists or forklift trucks. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it. 

- E0: This task involves physical work that requires hands-on skills and expertise in handling heavy machinery like hoists and forklift trucks. The task also involves potential safety risks and precise mechanical knowledge that cannot be effectively replaced by the LLM.

- E1: The LLM could potentially provide written instructions, safety guidelines, or procedural information related to removing or installing aircraft engines. It could also assist in generating documentation or reports related to the maintenance process. However, the actual physical work of using hoists or forklift trucks cannot be directly replaced by the LLM.

- E2: While the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time it takes to physically remove or install aircraft engines, additional software could be developed to provide virtual simulations or training modules for practicing these tasks. Such software could leverage the LLM's capabilities to generate interactive guides or troubleshooting tips for aircraft maintenance.

- E3: Given the limitations of the LLM in handling physical tasks and the need for hands-on expertise in aircraft maintenance, it is unlikely that image capabilities would significantly impact the completion of this task.

2: E0
