1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of assisting in the assessment, acquisition, or deployment of new electronic document management systems as a Document Management Specialist, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it.

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** The task involves working with electronic document management systems, which may require understanding technical specifications, comparing different systems, and providing recommendations. The LLM could assist in researching and summarizing information about various document management systems, providing insights on best practices, generating reports or documentation, and even drafting communication materials related to the deployment of the new systems. The LLM's ability to process and generate text could significantly reduce the time needed to gather information and prepare materials for decision-making.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the LLM could be helpful in providing information and generating content related to document management systems, the task of assessing, acquiring, and deploying new systems may involve more specialized knowledge beyond what the LLM can offer on its own. Additional software tools could be developed on top of the LLM to streamline the process further by integrating with existing databases, automating certain aspects of the assessment process, or providing tailored recommendations based on specific organizational needs.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Image capabilities would not significantly impact the task of assisting in the assessment, acquisition, or deployment of electronic document management systems, as the task primarily involves working with text-based information and systems rather than visual content.
