1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of identifying or developing reverse-engineering tools as a Digital Forensics Analyst, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be aided by the use of a large language model (LLM).

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** The task involves a significant amount of text-based work, such as researching existing tools, understanding system capabilities, and identifying vulnerabilities. An LLM can assist in generating code snippets, explanations, or summaries related to reverse-engineering tools, which can streamline the process and enhance the analyst's capabilities. The LLM can provide insights, explanations, and potential solutions based on the input provided, making the task more efficient and effective.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the task may not be directly reducible to half the time with just the LLM, additional software built on top of the LLM could further enhance the capabilities of a Digital Forensics Analyst. For example, specialized tools that can analyze code, simulate system behaviors, or provide recommendations based on the latest cybersecurity trends could be developed using the LLM's capabilities. These tools could significantly improve the efficiency and accuracy of the analyst's work.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Image capabilities are not directly relevant to the task of identifying or developing reverse-engineering tools in digital forensics. The task primarily involves text-based research, analysis, and coding, which can be effectively supported by the text-based capabilities of the LLM.

Based on the above considerations, the most appropriate label for the task of identifying or developing reverse-engineering tools as a Digital Forensics Analyst would be **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications)**.
