1: In this task, the funeral attendant is responsible for cleaning funeral parlors or chapels. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone or with additional software could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task. Since cleaning involves physical labor and does not directly involve text-based or information processing tasks that the LLM excels at, it is unlikely that the LLM or LLM-powered tools could automate or assist in cleaning funeral parlors. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM.

2: E0

3: High
