1: In this task, a Mobile Heavy Equipment Mechanic is required to fit bearings to adjust, repair, or overhaul mobile mechanical, hydraulic, and pneumatic equipment. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality by at least half.

- The task involves physical work on heavy equipment, which requires hands-on skills and precise measurements. The LLM does not have the capability to physically interact with equipment or take measurements.
- The task also involves technical knowledge of equipment mechanics, which may require specialized domain knowledge that the LLM may not have access to.
- While the LLM could potentially provide some general information or guidance on fitting bearings, the practical application of this knowledge in a hands-on setting is not something the LLM can directly assist with.

Based on these considerations, it is clear that the task of fitting bearings for heavy equipment falls under E0 as it does not meet the criteria for exposure to LLM capabilities.
