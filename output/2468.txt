1: In this task, a courier or messenger is responsible for collecting, sealing, and stamping outgoing mail. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone or with additional software could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality.

- E1: Direct exposure - The task involves a straightforward set of instructions that can be easily followed by a human worker. The LLM could potentially provide guidance on how to collect, seal, and stamp mail, but the physical actions of handling mail, using postage meters, and envelope sealers cannot be directly performed by the LLM. Therefore, the LLM alone would not reduce the time significantly for this task.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM itself may not directly reduce the time for this task, it is conceivable that additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to automate certain aspects of mail handling. For example, a robotic system integrated with the LLM could potentially assist in collecting, sealing, and stamping mail. This automation could reduce the time it takes to complete the task by half.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities would not significantly impact the completion of this task as it primarily involves physical actions related to handling mail rather than visual or image-related tasks.
