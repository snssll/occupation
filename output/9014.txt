1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of maintaining accurate laboratory records and data as a Molecular and Cellular Biologist, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be impacted by the use of the LLM.

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** The task of maintaining accurate laboratory records and data involves a significant amount of writing and organizing information. The LLM can assist in this task by helping to draft detailed records, ensuring clarity and accuracy in the documentation. The model can also provide suggestions for organizing data effectively, which can save time for the biologist.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the LLM can aid in writing and organizing data, there may be additional software that could be developed on top of the LLM to further streamline the process. For example, specialized software could be created to automatically extract data from experimental results and input them into the records, reducing manual data entry.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Image capabilities are not directly relevant to the task of maintaining laboratory records and data for Molecular and Cellular Biologists. This task primarily involves text-based information and does not require image processing.
