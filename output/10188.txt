1: In this task of monitoring the academic eligibility of student athletes, the main activities involve tracking academic performance, ensuring compliance with eligibility requirements set by academic institutions or sports organizations, and providing support or interventions as needed to help student athletes maintain their eligibility. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be significantly aided by the capabilities of the LLM. 

- Direct exposure (E1): The task involves a significant amount of text-based information related to academic eligibility, student performance, and compliance requirements. An LLM could assist in summarizing academic policies, generating reports on student academic progress, drafting communication materials for athletes, or even providing insights on academic regulations. The LLM could also help in drafting responses to common academic eligibility questions or scenarios.

- Exposure by LLM-powered applications (E2): While the LLM alone can provide valuable assistance in generating text-based content and summaries related to academic eligibility, additional software could be developed to streamline the process further. For example, an application could be created to automatically extract academic performance data from student records, cross-reference it with eligibility criteria, and generate real-time reports for coaches and scouts. This application could integrate with existing academic databases to provide up-to-date information.

- Exposure given image capabilities (E3): Image capabilities are not directly relevant to the task of monitoring academic eligibility, as the task primarily involves text-based information and data analysis related to student academic performance. Therefore, image capabilities would not significantly impact the completion of this task.

Based on the above analysis, the task of monitoring the academic eligibility of student athletes aligns best with Exposure by LLM-powered applications (E2) as the LLM can provide valuable support, but additional software could further enhance the efficiency of the process.
