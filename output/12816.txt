1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of preparing system activity and performance reports as a Telecommunications Engineering Specialist, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be impacted by the use of the LLM.

- Telecommunications Engineering Specialists are responsible for designing, implementing, and maintaining telecommunications systems. One of their tasks involves preparing system activity and performance reports, which may require analyzing data, identifying trends, and summarizing information.

- With access to the LLM, a Telecommunications Engineering Specialist could potentially use the model to assist in generating reports by inputting data and receiving structured summaries or analysis based on that data. The LLM could help in organizing and presenting the information in a clear and concise manner.

- While the LLM can assist in generating text and summaries, it may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task by at least half. The task of preparing system activity and performance reports may involve technical data and specialized knowledge that the LLM alone may not fully comprehend without additional context or domain-specific training.

- Therefore, the task falls under E2 - Exposure by LLM-powered applications. Although the LLM can provide assistance in generating text and summaries, additional software tailored to the telecommunications domain could further enhance the efficiency of completing this task.
