1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of writing new functions or applications in programming languages to conduct analyses as a Data Scientist, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves writing code, which is a complex instruction-based activity that can be significantly aided by the LLM. The LLM can assist in generating code snippets, providing explanations for programming concepts, and suggesting solutions to coding problems. Since the task involves text input and output within the context of programming, the LLM can be directly accessed to reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality by at least half. Therefore, this task falls under the E1 category.

2: E1

3: High
