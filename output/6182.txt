1: The task of erecting scaffolding involves physically setting up the structure to support workers and materials during construction or maintenance work. This task requires manual labor, spatial awareness, and adherence to safety regulations. Since it involves physical actions and does not directly involve text input or output, it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it cannot be significantly aided by the LLM or any tools built on top of it.
