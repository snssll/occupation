To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves providing information and arguments during negotiations, which can be formulated as text input and output. The LLM can assist in generating persuasive arguments, drafting position statements, and providing insights based on historical data or legal precedents. The model can also help in summarizing key points and crafting responses to counterarguments. Overall, the LLM can significantly reduce the time needed to prepare for negotiations and enhance the quality of the presented positions.
