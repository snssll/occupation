1: In this task for embalmers, the main steps involve attaching a trocar to a pump-tube, starting the pump, and repeating probing to force embalming fluid into organs. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if the task can be completed more efficiently with the help of an LLM. 

- The task involves a hands-on, physical aspect of attaching equipment and performing a specific procedure. This physical component cannot be directly assisted by an LLM.
- While the LLM could potentially provide information on embalming techniques, safety protocols, or troubleshooting tips, the practical application of attaching the trocar and operating the pump requires physical skills and real-time adjustments that an LLM cannot directly assist with.
- The task does not involve complex decision-making or specialized domain knowledge that would significantly benefit from LLM assistance beyond general guidance on embalming procedures.

Based on these considerations, the task of attaching a trocar to a pump-tube and forcing embalming fluid into organs is best classified as E0 - No exposure.
