1: In this task, the main activities involve ordering supplies and stocking them on shelves. These activities are straightforward and do not require complex decision-making or specialized knowledge beyond basic inventory management. The task does not involve any text generation, analysis, or interpretation that would benefit significantly from the capabilities of a large language model. Therefore, there is no clear indication that access to an LLM would reduce the time it takes to complete this task by at least half. As such, this task falls under E0 as it does not align with the criteria for E1, E2, or E3 exposure levels.
