1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of training production personnel in new or existing methods as a Manufacturing Engineer, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be supported by the capabilities of the LLM.

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** The task involves providing training to production personnel, which requires the creation of training materials, instructions, and possibly responding to questions or feedback. The LLM can assist in generating training materials based on general knowledge, writing instructions, and potentially answering questions related to the training content. The LLM can also help in summarizing information for training purposes. Therefore, the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to prepare training materials and instructions, making this task suitable for an E1 label.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the LLM can assist in generating training materials and instructions, the task of training production personnel may involve more specialized knowledge or hands-on demonstrations that the LLM alone may not cover. However, additional software built on top of the LLM could potentially provide more specialized training content or interactive training modules that could enhance the training process. Therefore, this task could also be considered for an E2 label.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** This task does not involve image processing or detailed visual instructions, so the image capabilities of the LLM would not significantly impact the completion of this task.
