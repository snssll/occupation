1: In this task, a Nuclear Monitoring Technician is responsible for collecting samples of various substances to assess radioactivity levels. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone or with additional software could significantly reduce the time it takes for a Nuclear Monitoring Technician to complete the task with high quality.

- E0: This task involves physical sampling and measurements that cannot be replaced by text-based interactions with the LLM. The LLM cannot physically collect samples or measure radioactivity levels, so it cannot directly assist in this task.

- E1: While the LLM could potentially provide information on sampling techniques, safety protocols, or data analysis methods related to nuclear monitoring, the core task of physically collecting samples and assessing radioactivity levels cannot be completed through text-based interactions alone. The LLM may help with background research or documentation related to the task, but it cannot directly perform the sampling.

- E2: It is conceivable that additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to assist Nuclear Monitoring Technicians in analyzing data, interpreting results, or generating reports based on the collected samples. This software could potentially streamline the data analysis process and provide insights based on the information gathered by the technician.

- E3: With access to image capabilities, the LLM could potentially assist in analyzing images of sample collection sites or equipment, but this would not significantly impact the core task of physically collecting samples and assessing radioactivity levels.
