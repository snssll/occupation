1: In this task, the occupation of Helpers--Carpenters involves erecting scaffolding, shoring, or braces. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone or with additional software could significantly reduce the time it takes for a worker to complete this task with high quality. 

Erecting scaffolding, shoring, or braces is a physical task that requires hands-on work and precise measurements. It involves setting up temporary structures to support construction work. This task does not involve text input or output, and the context is primarily based on physical actions rather than written information. The LLM and related tools are not designed to perform physical tasks or provide assistance in tasks that require precise measurements or physical labor. Therefore, the task of erecting scaffolding, shoring, or braces does not align with the capabilities of the LLM or tools built on top of it.
