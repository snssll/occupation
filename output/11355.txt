1: In this task, an audiologist is required to perform administrative tasks related to managing office functions and finances. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes for an audiologist to complete these administrative tasks with equivalent quality.

- E1: Direct exposure - If the LLM can assist in generating reports, organizing financial data, drafting emails, or creating office management plans, then it could reduce the time needed for an audiologist to perform these administrative tasks efficiently.
- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not reduce the time by half for these administrative tasks, it is conceivable that additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to automate financial analysis, generate office management reports, or provide recommendations for optimizing office functions.
- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not relevant for this task as it primarily involves administrative functions related to office management and finances.

2: E2

3: Moderate
