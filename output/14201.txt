1: In this task, a Manufacturing Engineer is required to redesign packaging for manufactured products to minimize raw material use or waste. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could assist in completing it. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM could help in generating ideas for redesigning packaging to minimize raw material use or waste by providing creative suggestions based on input criteria. It could also assist in drafting text for proposals or reports related to the redesign process.
- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time to complete the task, additional software could be developed to analyze data on raw material use, waste generation, and packaging design trends to provide recommendations for optimization.
- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Since the task involves redesigning packaging, having image capabilities could be beneficial for creating or editing digital images of the proposed packaging designs. The LLM could assist in generating text descriptions or rationales for the visual designs.
