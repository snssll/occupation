1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of contacting taxpayers by mail or telephone to address discrepancies and request supporting documentation as a Tax Examiner or Revenue Agent, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could assist in completing it more efficiently.

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** The task involves written communication with taxpayers, which can be significantly aided by the LLM in drafting clear and concise messages, requesting specific information, and addressing discrepancies effectively. The LLM can help in composing emails or letters, providing templates, and suggesting appropriate language to use in these communications.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the LLM can assist in drafting written communications, there may be additional software that could be developed on top of the LLM to streamline the process further. This software could potentially automate the process of contacting taxpayers, analyzing responses, and flagging discrepancies for further review.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Image capabilities are not relevant for this task as it primarily involves written communication with taxpayers and does not require image processing.

Considering the above points, the task of contacting taxpayers by mail or telephone to address discrepancies and request supporting documentation aligns best with **E1 (Direct exposure)** as the LLM can directly assist in composing written communications for this task.
