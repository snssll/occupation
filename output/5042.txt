1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of developing or implementing programs to address problems related to production, materials, safety, or quality as an Industrial Engineering Technologist or Technician, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be supported by the capabilities of the LLM.

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** The task involves analyzing problems related to production, materials, safety, or quality and developing or implementing programs to address these issues. An LLM could assist in providing insights, generating potential solutions, or even drafting program outlines based on the input data provided. The LLM can help in writing and transforming text according to complex instructions, which aligns with the task of developing programs. Therefore, the direct access to the LLM could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the task may not be reduced by half solely with access to the LLM, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to streamline the process further. This software could potentially summarize industry-specific knowledge, provide recommendations based on data, or even analyze written information to inform decisions more efficiently. However, the task itself may not directly benefit from these capabilities without further development.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Image capabilities are not directly relevant to the task of developing or implementing programs related to production, materials, safety, or quality. Therefore, this task does not fall under E3.
