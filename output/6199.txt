1: In this task, a Food Service Manager is required to establish and enforce nutritional standards for dining establishments based on accepted industry standards. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the complexity of the task and how much the LLM can assist in completing it.

- E0: This task involves setting and enforcing nutritional standards, which requires a deep understanding of industry regulations, dietary guidelines, and possibly local laws. The task also involves decision-making based on a variety of factors beyond just text input. The LLM may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task as it requires specialized knowledge and judgment that goes beyond text-based information.

- E1: The LLM could potentially assist in providing information on industry standards, dietary guidelines, and regulations related to nutritional standards. It could help in summarizing relevant documents, providing feedback on drafts of standards, or generating questions for further research. However, the task of establishing and enforcing nutritional standards involves more than just text-based information and may require practical experience and expertise that the LLM alone cannot provide.

- E2: While the LLM could be used to access and summarize industry standards, regulations, and guidelines, additional software could be developed to analyze data, provide recommendations based on specific inputs, or maintain complex databases of nutritional information. This additional software could enhance the capabilities of the LLM in assisting Food Service Managers in establishing and enforcing nutritional standards more efficiently.

- E3: This task does not involve image processing or detailed visual information, so the image capabilities of the LLM would not significantly impact the completion of this task.
