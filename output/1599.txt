1: In this task of building, configuring, or testing robots or robotic applications, the use of the LLM could potentially fall under E2 exposure. While the LLM itself may not directly reduce the time it takes to physically build or test robots, it could be used to generate code, provide insights on best practices, troubleshoot issues, or offer innovative ideas for robotic applications. Additionally, with further development, specialized software could be created on top of the LLM to assist in designing and simulating robots, optimizing configurations, or even automating certain testing processes. This additional software could significantly enhance the efficiency of the task.
