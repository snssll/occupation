1: In this task, a First-Line Supervisor of Firefighting and Prevention Workers is responsible for scheduling employee work assignments and setting work priorities. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we can break down the task:
- The task involves writing and transforming text (employee work schedules) according to specific instructions (work priorities).
- The task requires organizing and managing information (employee schedules and work priorities).
- The task may involve some decision-making based on the priorities and available resources.

Given that the task primarily involves text-based information processing, organizing, and decision-making, it aligns more closely with E1 exposure. The LLM can assist in generating employee work schedules, organizing information, and potentially providing insights into setting work priorities based on the input data.

2: E1
