1: In this task, a bailiff is responsible for enforcing courtroom rules of behavior and warning individuals not to smoke or disturb court proceedings. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone or with additional software could significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality.

- Direct access to the LLM could potentially assist in drafting warning notices or scripts for verbal warnings to individuals who are disrupting court proceedings. The LLM could provide language suggestions or templates for such communications, which could save time for the bailiff.
- However, since this task involves physical presence and enforcement within a courtroom setting, where human judgment and interaction are crucial, the LLM alone cannot perform the essential duties of a bailiff, such as physically removing disruptive individuals or ensuring courtroom security.
- While the LLM could potentially assist in drafting written warnings or guidelines, the core responsibilities of a bailiff require real-time decision-making and physical presence, which the LLM cannot provide.
