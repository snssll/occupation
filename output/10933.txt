1: In this task, a Camera Operator for television, video, and film is required to operate zoom lenses to change images according to specifications and rehearsal instructions. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves operating equipment (zoom lenses) based on specific instructions and specifications. While the task does not involve complex decision-making or analysis beyond following instructions, it does require physical manipulation of equipment. The task is more hands-on and practical, involving the physical operation of camera equipment rather than cognitive tasks that can be easily automated by an LLM. Therefore, the task does not align with the capabilities of an LLM, as it cannot physically operate equipment. As a result, this task would be classified as E0.
