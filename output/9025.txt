1: In this task, a surgical assistant is required to maintain an unobstructed operative field during a surgical procedure. This involves using surgical retractors, sponges, or suctioning and irrigating equipment to ensure the surgeon has a clear view and access to the surgical site. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if access to the LLM or LLM-powered tools can significantly reduce the time it takes for a surgical assistant to perform this task with high quality.

- E0: This task involves physical actions and real-time decision-making during a surgical procedure, which cannot be replaced by text-based tools like the LLM. The precision and immediate response required in this task make it unsuitable for automation through language models.

- E1: The task of maintaining an unobstructed operative field is highly practical and hands-on, involving physical manipulation of equipment in a surgical setting. While the LLM can provide information or guidance on surgical procedures, it cannot directly assist in physically maintaining the operative field during surgery. Therefore, direct access to the LLM would not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task.

- E2: While it is conceivable that specialized software could be developed to assist surgical assistants in certain aspects of their work, such as providing real-time guidance or information during surgery, the physical nature of this task makes it challenging to automate using text-based tools alone. The complexity and critical nature of surgical procedures also require specialized training and expertise beyond what an LLM can provide.

- E3: The task of maintaining an unobstructed operative field does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images. Therefore, the image capabilities of the LLM would not significantly impact the completion of this task.
