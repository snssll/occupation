1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of processing and recording new insurance policies and claims as an Insurance Claims and Policy Processing Clerk, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be impacted by the use of the LLM.

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** The task of processing and recording new insurance policies and claims involves a significant amount of written documentation and data entry. The LLM can assist in generating responses to common queries, drafting policy documents, summarizing claims information, and providing guidance on policy terms and conditions. By using the LLM, the clerk can potentially speed up the process of reviewing and inputting information, ensuring accuracy and efficiency in policy processing.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the LLM can be helpful in providing information and generating text related to insurance policies and claims, developing specialized software on top of the LLM could further enhance the efficiency of the process. This software could automate data extraction from forms, cross-reference policy details, and streamline the overall policy processing workflow. Such applications could leverage the LLM's capabilities to handle more complex tasks beyond basic text generation.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Image capabilities are not directly relevant to the task of processing and recording new insurance policies and claims. This task primarily involves dealing with textual information and data entry, which can be effectively handled by the LLM without the need for image processing.
