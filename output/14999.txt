1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of reviewing company records to determine the amount of insurance in force, we need to consider the level of automation and assistance that the LLM can provide in completing this task. 

- The task involves reviewing company records, which may require analyzing and interpreting complex information.
- The task does not involve precise measurements or detailed visuals that would require E3 capabilities.
- While the task may benefit from some automation in data retrieval and analysis, it is not clear if the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task by at least half.
- It is possible that additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to assist in data retrieval and analysis, potentially falling under E2 capabilities.
