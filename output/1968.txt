1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of cleaning and polishing shoes as a Shoe and Leather Worker and Repairer, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves manual labor and physical interaction with shoes, which cannot be directly replaced by the LLM. The LLM does not have the ability to physically clean or polish shoes. While the LLM can provide information on shoe cleaning techniques or product recommendations, it cannot perform the task itself. Therefore, the task does not fall under E1, E2, or E3 categories as it cannot be significantly aided by the LLM.
