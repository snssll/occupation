To complete this task, the embalmer needs to accurately document and organize this information for future reference. With the help of the LLM, the embalmer could potentially streamline the record-keeping process by generating templates, organizing data, and ensuring consistency in the documentation. The LLM could assist in creating detailed and accurate records, saving time and reducing the chances of errors in maintaining these records.

Considering the nature of the task and the potential for the LLM to aid in organizing and documenting information efficiently, I would classify this task as E1 - Direct exposure.
