1: In this task, a Structural Iron and Steel Worker unloads and positions prefabricated steel units for hoisting. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if access to the LLM or LLM-powered tools can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality.

- Structural Iron and Steel Workers typically engage in physical labor, such as unloading and positioning steel units. This task involves manual work that cannot be directly replaced by text-based interactions with the LLM.
- The task does not involve complex text-based instructions, writing, summarizing documents, or any other activities that can be easily automated by the LLM.
- There is no need for up-to-date facts, specialized domain knowledge, or image capabilities to complete this task.
- The task does not involve decision-making based on data analysis or recommendations that could be provided by the LLM.

Based on these considerations, it is clear that the task of unloading and positioning prefabricated steel units for hoisting does not align with any of the exposure levels in the rubric. Therefore, it falls under E0 - No exposure.

2: E0

3: High
