1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of planning or coordinating the investigation and resolution of customers' reports of technical problems with aircraft or aerospace vehicles as an Aerospace Engineer, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be aided by the use of a large language model (LLM).

- Aerospace Engineers require access to technical knowledge, regulations, and best practices in the aerospace industry to effectively investigate and resolve technical problems with aircraft or aerospace vehicles.
- An LLM can assist Aerospace Engineers by providing up-to-date information on technical issues, regulations, and industry standards, which can help in the investigation and resolution process.
- The LLM can also help in drafting reports, communicating with customers, and generating solutions based on the input provided by the engineers.
- While the task involves technical expertise and decision-making, the LLM can significantly reduce the time required to gather information, draft communications, and propose solutions.

Based on these considerations, the task of planning or coordinating the investigation and resolution of customers' reports of technical problems with aircraft or aerospace vehicles as an Aerospace Engineer would likely fall under the label E2 - Exposure by LLM-powered applications.
