1: For the task of typing, filing, and duplicating materials as a Teaching Assistant in schools, the exposure to LLM can be evaluated as follows:

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** The task involves a lot of text-based work such as typing and potentially summarizing materials. The LLM can assist in generating text, organizing information, and potentially automating some aspects of the task. By using the LLM directly, the time taken to type, file, and duplicate materials can be significantly reduced with equivalent quality.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the task may not require highly specialized domain knowledge or complex databases, there could be additional software developed on top of the LLM that could further streamline the process. For example, an application that can automatically organize and categorize files based on content or generate summaries of materials could enhance efficiency.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Image capabilities may not be directly relevant to this task as it primarily involves text-based work. The task of typing, filing, and duplicating materials does not require image processing or editing.

Considering the nature of the task and the potential for the LLM to assist in text-based tasks, the most suitable label appears to be **E1 (Direct exposure)**.
