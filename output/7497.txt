1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of identifying plants, pests, and weeds to determine the selection and application of pesticides and fertilizers as a Farmworker and Laborer in Crop, Nursery, and Greenhouse, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The LLM can provide information on plants, pests, and weeds based on existing knowledge within its training data. It can also assist in generating text-based recommendations for pesticide and fertilizer selection based on the identified plants, pests, and weeds. However, the task involves practical, hands-on work that requires physical observation and interaction with the plants, pests, and weeds in the real environment, which the LLM cannot directly assist with. While the LLM can provide some guidance and information, the actual identification process and application of pesticides and fertilizers would still heavily rely on manual labor and physical presence.
