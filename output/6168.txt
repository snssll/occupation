1: For the task of entering text into a computer keyboard and selecting the size and style of type, column width, and appropriate spacing for printed materials as a Desktop Publisher, the exposure to LLM can be evaluated as follows:

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM can assist in providing guidance on selecting the appropriate size, style of type, column width, and spacing for printed materials. It can generate sample layouts, suggest design elements, and offer recommendations based on input criteria. The LLM can also help in transforming text according to specific instructions provided by the user.
  
- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to automate the process further. This software could potentially summarize design principles, provide real-time feedback on layout choices, and offer suggestions based on industry best practices.
  
- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not directly relevant to the task of entering text and selecting design elements for printed materials. Therefore, this task does not fall under E3.

2: E2

3: Moderate
