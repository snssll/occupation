1: In this task, a mortician, undertaker, or funeral arranger is responsible for receiving or ushering people to their seats for services. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with high quality. 

- E0: This task involves physical interaction and human presence, which cannot be replaced by the LLM. The task requires the physical presence of the mortician or funeral arranger to guide and assist people, making it unsuitable for automation by the LLM.
- E1: The task of receiving or ushering people to their seats for services involves physical actions and interactions that cannot be effectively replaced by the LLM alone. The LLM cannot physically guide or usher people, so it cannot significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task.
- E2: While it is conceivable that software could be developed to automate certain aspects of funeral arrangements or services, such as providing information or managing logistics, the specific task of ushering people to their seats for services still requires physical presence and interaction, making it challenging for the LLM alone to reduce the time significantly.
- E3: The task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images, so the image capabilities of the LLM are not relevant in this context.

Based on the above analysis, the most appropriate label for this task is E0.

2: E0

3: High
