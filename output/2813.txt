1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of conducting applied research on environmental topics as an Environmental Scientist, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves researching environmental topics, which typically requires analyzing and synthesizing information from various sources. The LLM can assist in this process by providing access to a vast amount of text data, summarizing information, generating insights, and even helping in formulating research questions. However, the task also involves practical aspects of environmental research, such as conducting experiments, fieldwork, and data collection, which the LLM cannot directly assist with. While the LLM can provide valuable information and insights, it cannot replace the hands-on work required in environmental research.
