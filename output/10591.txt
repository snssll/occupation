1: In this task, a Funeral Attendant is responsible for obtaining doctors' signatures on death certificates and completing paperwork like insurance claims forms. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves a significant amount of paperwork and documentation, which can be time-consuming and require attention to detail. An LLM could potentially assist in generating templates for paperwork, providing guidance on filling out forms, and suggesting appropriate language for communication with doctors and insurance companies. The LLM could also help in understanding any complex terminology or requirements related to death certificates and insurance claims.

Considering the complexity of the task and the potential for the LLM to streamline the paperwork process, I would classify this task as E1 - Direct exposure. The LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task by providing assistance with writing and transforming text, providing edits to existing documents, and generating relevant information needed for the paperwork.
