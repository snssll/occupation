1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of writing and distributing financial or environmental impact reports as Chief Sustainability Officers, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves writing reports based on financial and environmental data, which can be complex and require specialized knowledge. The LLM can assist in generating text based on input data and guidelines, which aligns with tasks such as providing edits to existing text, summarizing documents, and preparing training materials based on general knowledge. However, the task may also involve analyzing data and making recommendations, which are capabilities not explicitly mentioned in the exposure rubric.

Given that the LLM can assist in writing reports and summarizing information, it falls under the E1 label as it can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality by at least half.
