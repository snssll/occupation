1: In this task, a construction manager is responsible for requisitioning supplies or materials to complete construction projects. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone or with additional software could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality.

- E0: This task involves practical considerations such as assessing the quality, quantity, and specific requirements of construction materials. It also involves interactions with suppliers, understanding project timelines, and coordinating with the construction team. These aspects require human judgment, experience, and real-time decision-making, which cannot be effectively replaced by an LLM or LLM-powered tool.

- E1: While the LLM could potentially assist in drafting requisition documents or providing general information on construction materials, the core of this task involves practical knowledge, negotiation skills, and real-world logistics that are beyond the capabilities of the LLM. The nuanced decision-making involved in selecting the right materials and suppliers based on project requirements and budget constraints cannot be fully automated by the LLM.

- E2: It is conceivable that additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to streamline the process of researching suppliers, comparing material prices, or generating initial drafts of requisition documents. However, the complex nature of construction projects, the need for hands-on coordination, and the dynamic nature of material availability and pricing make it challenging for the LLM alone to significantly reduce the time needed to complete this task.

- E3: The task of requisitioning supplies for construction projects does not involve image processing or detailed visual analysis, so the image capabilities of the LLM would not provide a significant advantage in completing this task.
