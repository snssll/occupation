1: In this task, the Teaching Assistant is required to enforce administration policies and rules governing students. This involves ensuring that students adhere to the school's guidelines and regulations. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be significantly aided by the use of the language model. Enforcing policies and rules typically involves understanding and applying specific guidelines, which may not directly benefit from the capabilities of an LLM. While the LLM could potentially assist in drafting communication related to policy enforcement, the core task of enforcing policies and rules may not be directly impacted by the language model's abilities.
