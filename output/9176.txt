1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of maintaining judges' law libraries by assembling or updating appropriate documents as a Judicial Law Clerk, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be impacted by the use of the LLM.

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** If the task involves a significant amount of writing, organizing, and updating legal documents, the LLM could be used to assist in summarizing legal texts, drafting memos, or providing relevant legal references. The LLM could help in researching and compiling information efficiently, reducing the time needed for manual document assembly and updates.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the task may not be directly reducible to half the time with just the LLM, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to create a system that can search and retrieve legal documents, analyze case law, and provide recommendations for updating law libraries. Such a system could significantly enhance the efficiency of maintaining law libraries.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Image capabilities would not have a significant impact on this task as it primarily involves text-based legal documents. The task does not require image processing or editing, so the image capabilities provided by the LLM would not be relevant in this context.
