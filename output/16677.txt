1: In this task, a Maid or Housekeeping Cleaner is required to sweep, scrub, wax, or polish floors using various tools. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if the task can be significantly expedited or improved by using the LLM. Since this task involves physical labor and manual work, it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM, which is focused on text-based tasks. The LLM cannot physically operate machines or perform cleaning tasks. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not benefit from LLM capabilities.

2: E0

3: High
