1: In this task, a Mobile Heavy Equipment Mechanic is required to dismantle and reassemble heavy equipment using hoists and hand tools. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves physical work that cannot be directly performed by an LLM or any software tool. It requires hands-on skills, knowledge of mechanical systems, and physical strength to operate hoists and hand tools. Since the task involves manual labor and does not involve text-based or analytical work that can be automated by an LLM, it falls under the category of E0. The task does not align with the capabilities of the LLM or any software tool that could be developed on top of it to reduce the time it takes to complete the task.

2: E0

3: High
