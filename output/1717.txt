1: In this task, a paralegal or legal assistant is required to call upon witnesses to testify at a hearing. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could assist in completing it. 

- E0: This task involves human interaction and legal procedures that require specific knowledge and skills beyond what an LLM can provide. The task also involves making decisions that impact legal proceedings, which cannot be delegated to an LLM.
- E1: The LLM could potentially assist in drafting the script for calling witnesses or providing guidance on legal procedures related to calling witnesses. However, the task involves significant human interaction and decision-making that an LLM cannot fully replace.
- E2: While an LLM could potentially provide information on legal procedures or guidelines for calling witnesses, the task itself requires practical legal knowledge and experience that go beyond what an LLM can offer. Developing software specifically for this task may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete it.
- E3: The task does not involve image capabilities, so this label does not apply.

Based on the analysis, the most appropriate label for this task is E2.

2: E2

3: Moderate
