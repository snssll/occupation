1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of studying and rehearsing roles as an actor, we need to consider how the task could be impacted by the use of a large language model (LLM). 

- E0: This task involves a high degree of human interaction and physical performance, such as memorizing lines, stunts, and cues. An LLM cannot physically perform stunts or cues, and the memorization aspect is more about practice and interpretation rather than simply looking up information. Therefore, the use of an LLM would not significantly reduce the time it takes for an actor to study and rehearse roles.

- E1: While an LLM could potentially assist with providing information about the background of a character or context within a script, the core aspect of studying and rehearsing roles involves practical application, interpretation, and physical performance, which cannot be directly replaced by an LLM. The nuanced understanding and embodiment of a character's emotions and motivations require human creativity and expression.

- E2: It is conceivable that additional software could be developed on top of an LLM to provide actors with personalized coaching tips, character analysis, or scene breakdowns based on the script input. This software could potentially enhance the actor's preparation process by offering insights or suggestions, but it would not completely replace the actor's own interpretation and rehearsal work.

- E3: The task of studying and rehearsing roles as an actor does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images. Therefore, the use of image capabilities alongside an LLM would not significantly impact the completion of this task.
