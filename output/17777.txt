1: In this task, the occupation involves assembling aircraft structures, surfaces, rigging, and systems. The specific task mentioned is welding tubing and fittings or soldering cable ends using various equipment. To determine the exposure level, we need to consider if the task can be significantly expedited or improved by using the LLM. The LLM could potentially assist in providing detailed instructions on welding techniques, safety precautions, equipment maintenance, troubleshooting common issues, or even suggesting innovative approaches to improve efficiency. However, since this task involves hands-on work with specialized equipment and materials, it is unlikely that the LLM alone or tools built on top of it could reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete the task by at least half. The task requires physical skills, precision, and real-time decision-making that cannot be fully replicated by the LLM.
