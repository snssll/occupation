1: In this task, an Audiovisual Equipment Installer and Repairer is required to make service calls to repair units in customers' homes or return units to shops for major repairs. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves interacting with customers, diagnosing issues with audiovisual equipment, and performing repairs. While the LLM could potentially assist with generating repair manuals, troubleshooting guides, or communication templates for customers, the task itself heavily relies on physical interaction, technical skills, and hands-on repair work. The LLM may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task as it involves practical, on-site repair work that cannot be fully automated by text-based AI models. Therefore, this task is best classified as E0 as it does not clearly benefit from LLM capabilities to reduce the time needed for completion.
