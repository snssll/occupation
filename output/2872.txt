1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of conducting exit interviews to identify reasons for employee termination as a Human Resources Manager, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. In this task, the LLM could potentially assist in generating a list of common questions to ask during exit interviews, analyzing responses to identify trends or patterns, and even drafting reports summarizing the findings. The LLM could also help in providing guidance on best practices for conducting exit interviews effectively.

Given that the task involves primarily text-based activities such as generating questions, analyzing responses, and summarizing information, the LLM's text generation and analysis capabilities could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality. Therefore, this task falls under the E1 label as direct access to the LLM can streamline the process of conducting exit interviews and analyzing the data gathered.
