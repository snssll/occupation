1: Music therapists design or provide music therapy experiences to address client needs, such as using music for self-care, adjusting to life changes, improving cognitive functioning, raising self-esteem, communicating, or controlling impulses. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. In this case, the task involves designing or providing music therapy experiences tailored to individual client needs. While an LLM could potentially assist in generating general information about music therapy techniques or theories, the task of designing personalized therapy experiences requires a deep understanding of the client's specific needs, preferences, and therapeutic goals. This level of personalization and human interaction is not something that can be effectively automated by an LLM. Therefore, the task falls under E0 as it involves a high degree of human interaction and personalized decision-making that cannot be significantly expedited by the use of an LLM.
