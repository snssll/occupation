1: In this task, the Online Merchant is required to integrate online retailing strategy with physical or catalogue retailing operations. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves strategizing and implementing a plan to combine online retailing with physical or catalogue retailing. This task requires a deep understanding of retail operations, market trends, consumer behavior, and business strategy. While the LLM can provide general information on retailing strategies and trends, it may not have access to specific company data, market research, or real-time information on consumer behavior. The task also involves decision-making based on a combination of data analysis, market research, and strategic planning, which may require human judgment and expertise beyond what the LLM can provide. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it involves complex decision-making, specialized domain knowledge, and real-time data analysis that may not be fully supported by the LLM alone.
