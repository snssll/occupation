To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves collecting data, which could potentially benefit from the LLM's ability to assist in research and data gathering.
- The task also involves providing project documentation, which could be streamlined with the LLM's help in summarizing information or drafting reports.
- Training staff may involve creating training materials, which the LLM can assist in preparing based on general knowledge.
- Performing general administrative duties may include tasks like maintaining records, which the LLM can help with.

Considering these points, the task can benefit from the LLM's capabilities in writing, summarizing, and preparing materials based on general knowledge. Therefore, this task falls under label E1 as the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality.
