1: In this task, an Amusement and Recreation Attendant is responsible for providing assistance to patrons entering or exiting various attractions such as amusement rides, boats, ski lifts, or animals. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. This task involves physical interaction with patrons, ensuring their safety, and providing assistance in a hands-on manner. It does not involve complex text-based tasks that can be easily automated or assisted by an LLM. The task requires physical presence, observation, and immediate action to ensure the well-being of patrons. Therefore, the task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of an LLM or any software built on top of it.
