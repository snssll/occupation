1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of developing new software applications or customizing existing applications for Bioinformatics Scientists, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be impacted by the use of the LLM.

- Developing new software applications or customizing existing applications requires a deep understanding of bioinformatics, programming languages, and scientific project requirements. This task involves complex instructions, coding, and problem-solving skills.
- The LLM can assist in writing and transforming text and code according to complex instructions. It can also provide insights and suggestions based on the input provided.
- While the LLM can generate code snippets or provide explanations related to bioinformatics concepts, it may not have the specialized domain knowledge required for in-depth bioinformatics software development.
- The task may involve highly specialized knowledge and technical expertise beyond what the LLM can provide on its own.

Based on these considerations, the task of developing new software applications or customizing existing applications for Bioinformatics Scientists falls under label E2 - Exposure by LLM-powered applications. While the LLM can assist with certain aspects of the task, additional software specifically tailored for bioinformatics and scientific project needs would be required to significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task.
