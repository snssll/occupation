1: In this task, an Insurance Claims and Policy Processing Clerk is required to provide customer service by giving limited instructions on proceeding with claims or referring customers to auto repair facilities or local contractors. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- E0: This task involves human interaction and decision-making that impacts customers directly. It requires empathy, judgment, and the ability to understand and address customer needs effectively. The LLM alone cannot replace the human touch and personalized assistance required in customer service interactions.

- E1: While the LLM could potentially assist in drafting responses or providing general information, the task of providing customer service in this context goes beyond just text generation. It involves understanding individual customer needs, assessing specific situations, and providing tailored guidance, which may not be effectively handled by the LLM alone.

- E2: It is conceivable that additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to assist with customer service tasks by analyzing customer data, providing personalized recommendations, or automating certain aspects of the process. However, the complexity of human interactions and the need for nuanced decision-making in customer service may still require significant human involvement.

- E3: Image capabilities would not significantly impact the completion of this task, as it primarily involves text-based interactions with customers rather than image processing.
