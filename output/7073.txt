1: In this task, the economist is required to forecast production and consumption of renewable resources and supply, consumption, and depletion of non-renewable resources. To complete this task, the economist would typically need to analyze historical data, economic trends, environmental factors, and various other variables to make accurate predictions. With access to the powerful OpenAI large language model (LLM), the economist could potentially leverage the model to process and analyze vast amounts of data, generate complex economic models, and simulate different scenarios to forecast resource production and consumption effectively. The LLM could assist in data analysis, trend identification, scenario modeling, and potentially even in generating reports based on the analysis conducted. While the LLM alone may not reduce the time it takes to complete the task by half, it is easy to imagine additional software that could be developed on top of the LLM to further enhance the forecasting capabilities, such as integrating real-time data feeds, automating data collection, or providing more advanced predictive analytics tools. Therefore, this task falls under the label E2 - Exposure by LLM-powered applications.
