1: In this task, a Sales Representative for Technical and Scientific Products is required to compute customer's installation or production costs and estimate savings from new services, products, or equipment. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves analyzing financial data, calculating costs, and estimating savings based on various factors. This requires a good understanding of technical and scientific products, as well as the ability to perform calculations accurately.
- The task does not involve direct text input or output that can be easily processed by an LLM. It requires specific domain knowledge and expertise in financial analysis.
- While an LLM could potentially assist in providing general information on technical and scientific products, it may not significantly reduce the time it takes to compute installation or production costs and estimate savings accurately.
- Developing software on top of the LLM that could handle complex financial calculations and analysis specific to technical and scientific products would be challenging and may not provide a significant time-saving benefit.

Based on these considerations, the task falls under E0 as it involves specialized domain knowledge, complex calculations, and analysis that are not easily automated by an LLM alone.
