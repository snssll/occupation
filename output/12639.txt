1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of preparing or presenting public briefings on the status of environmental engineering projects as an Environmental Engineer, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it more efficiently.

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** The task involves communicating information about environmental engineering projects to the public, which requires writing and presenting information clearly and effectively. The LLM could assist in drafting the content of the briefings, providing accurate and detailed information, and helping to structure the presentation. It can also help in summarizing key points and generating questions that the audience might ask. Overall, the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to prepare for the public briefings with equivalent quality.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the LLM can assist in generating content and structuring the presentation, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to provide more specialized recommendations or insights based on data related to environmental engineering projects. This additional software could enhance the quality and efficiency of the public briefings further.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Image capabilities are not directly relevant to the task of preparing or presenting public briefings on environmental engineering projects. The task primarily involves written and verbal communication rather than image processing.
