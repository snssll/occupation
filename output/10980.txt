1: In this task, an online merchant is responsible for ordering or purchasing merchandise to ensure that the inventory levels are optimal. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM can assist in completing it. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM can help the online merchant by providing insights into trends, customer preferences, and market demands based on the text input provided. It can generate suggestions on which merchandise to order, how much to order, and when to order to maintain optimal inventory levels. The LLM can also assist in analyzing data related to sales, inventory turnover, and seasonal trends to make informed purchasing decisions.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not reduce the time it takes to complete the task by half, additional software built on top of the LLM could enhance its capabilities. For example, a specialized tool could be developed to integrate with the LLM and automatically analyze inventory data, sales reports, and market trends to generate optimized purchasing recommendations for the online merchant.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not directly relevant to the task of ordering or purchasing merchandise to maintain optimal inventory levels. Therefore, this task does not fall under E3.
