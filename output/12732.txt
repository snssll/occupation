1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of preparing reports or recommendations based on research outcomes for Biochemists and Biophysicists, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. In this case, the task involves synthesizing research findings into reports or recommendations, which heavily relies on written communication skills and the ability to analyze and interpret data.

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM can assist in writing and transforming text based on complex instructions, providing edits to existing text, summarizing documents, and generating questions or feedback on documents. In this task, the LLM could help in drafting reports or recommendations based on the research outcomes, potentially reducing the time needed for writing and structuring the content.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time to complete the task, additional software built on top of the LLM could enhance the process. For instance, specialized tools could be developed to analyze research data, extract key insights, and generate tailored recommendations based on the findings. These applications could streamline the report preparation process for Biochemists and Biophysicists.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not directly relevant to the task of preparing reports or recommendations based on research outcomes for Biochemists and Biophysicists. This task primarily involves text-based analysis and communication rather than image processing.
