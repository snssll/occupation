1: In this task of lifting, positioning, and removing barricades to open or close parking areas, the main actions involve physical movement and manual labor. These actions cannot be directly performed by an LLM or any software tool. While an LLM could potentially provide information or guidance on parking regulations or safety protocols related to barricades, the core task of physically handling barricades is outside the capabilities of the LLM. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not involve text input or output that can be significantly aided by an LLM.
