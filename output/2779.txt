1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of computing or recording photonic test data as a Photonics Technician, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be aided by the use of a large language model (LLM).

- Photonics Technicians typically deal with the practical aspects of working with light, such as lasers, fiber optics, and other optical systems. Computing or recording photonic test data involves processing and documenting data related to light and optical systems.
- An LLM could potentially assist in tasks related to documenting and organizing test data by providing templates, formatting suggestions, or even generating reports based on the input data.
- While the task itself is more technical and hands-on, the documentation aspect could benefit from the LLM's ability to assist in writing and organizing information.

Based on these considerations, the task of computing or recording photonic test data as a Photonics Technician could be classified as E1 - Direct exposure.

2: E1

3: Moderate
