1: In this task, a neurologist is required to order supportive care services for their patients, such as physical therapy, specialized nursing care, and social services. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes for a neurologist to complete this task with high quality. 

- E0: This task involves making decisions about patient care that require specialized medical knowledge and expertise. While the LLM can provide general information about supportive care services, it cannot replace the specialized training and experience of a neurologist in making these decisions. Therefore, the task is unlikely to be significantly expedited by the LLM alone.

- E1: The LLM could potentially assist a neurologist in providing general information about different supportive care services, such as explaining what physical therapy entails or the benefits of specialized nursing care. However, the actual decision-making process and ordering of these services would still heavily rely on the neurologist's expertise and patient-specific considerations. The LLM could help in generating initial drafts of the orders, but the final decisions would need to be made by the neurologist.

- E2: While the LLM could be used to summarize information about different supportive care services or provide general recommendations based on existing medical knowledge, developing a specialized software tool that integrates with the LLM to analyze patient-specific data and make tailored recommendations for supportive care services would be more beneficial. Such a tool could potentially reduce the time it takes for a neurologist to order these services by half.

- E3: The task does not involve image capabilities, so exposure to LLM with image capabilities would not significantly impact the completion time of this task.
