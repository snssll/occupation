1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of correcting surface imperfections or filling chipped, cracked, or broken bricks or tiles, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be completed with the help of an LLM.

- This task involves manual labor and physical manipulation of materials, such as fillers, adhesives, and grouting materials. It requires hands-on work to repair the imperfections in bricks or tiles.
- While an LLM can provide information on the types of fillers, adhesives, or grouting materials to use based on general knowledge, it cannot physically perform the task of correcting surface imperfections.
- The task does not involve complex written instructions, data analysis, or decision-making that could be significantly expedited by an LLM.

Based on these considerations, the task of correcting surface imperfections or filling chipped, cracked, or broken bricks or tiles is best classified as E0 - No exposure to LLM.
