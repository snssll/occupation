1: In this task, a Refractory Materials Repairer is responsible for spreading mortar on stopper heads and rods, using trowels, and sliding brick sleeves over rods to form refractory jackets. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. Since this task involves physical actions like spreading mortar and sliding brick sleeves, it does not involve text input or output that can be processed by an LLM. The task is hands-on and requires manual dexterity, which cannot be replicated by an LLM. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of an LLM.
