1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of maintaining fitness equipment as an Exercise Trainer or Group Fitness Instructor, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. In this task, the main activities would involve tasks such as checking and cleaning equipment, ensuring proper functionality, and possibly performing minor repairs. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM could potentially assist in providing guidelines for equipment maintenance, troubleshooting common issues, or generating checklists for equipment upkeep. It could also help in documenting maintenance schedules or creating instructional materials for equipment care. However, the direct impact of the LLM in reducing the time significantly for this task may be limited as it involves physical actions like cleaning and repairing equipment.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While there could be software developed on top of the LLM that could provide detailed maintenance instructions, troubleshooting guides, or even virtual simulations for equipment repairs, the current capabilities of the LLM alone may not reduce the time significantly for this task.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities would not significantly impact the task of maintaining fitness equipment as it primarily involves physical actions rather than visual or image-related tasks.
