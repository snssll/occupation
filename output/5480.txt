1: In this task, a Postal Service Mail Sorter needs to direct items according to established routing schemes using computer-controlled keyboards or voice-recognition equipment. With the help of a large language model (LLM), the worker could potentially receive guidance on how to operate the computer-controlled keyboards or voice-recognition equipment more efficiently. The LLM could provide instructions, troubleshoot common issues, or even suggest improvements in the routing schemes based on the input provided. However, the task itself involves physical interaction with equipment and items, which cannot be directly assisted by the LLM. Therefore, the LLM can only provide indirect support in terms of guidance and suggestions related to the task.
