1: In this task, the Drilling and Boring Machine Tool Setters, Operators, and Tenders, Metal and Plastic need to change worn cutting tools using wrenches. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we can break down the task:
- The task involves a specific manual action of changing worn cutting tools using wrenches, which does not directly involve writing, summarizing, translating, or any other text-based activity that an LLM could significantly assist with.
- The task does not require accessing up-to-date information, specialized domain knowledge, or complex databases that an LLM could help retrieve or analyze.
- There is no need for image capabilities to complete this task, as it is a manual operation with tools.

Based on the analysis, the task does not align with any of the exposure levels in the rubric as it is a manual, hands-on task that does not benefit from LLM capabilities.
