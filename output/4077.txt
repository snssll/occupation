1: In this task, an Aircraft Structure, Surfaces, Rigging, and Systems Assembler is required to cut cables and tubing using master templates, measuring instruments, and tools like cable cutters or saws. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if the task can be significantly expedited or improved by using the LLM. 

- The task involves physical actions such as cutting cables and tubing, which cannot be directly assisted by the LLM.
- The task requires hands-on skills and precision that are not related to text-based or information processing tasks.
- The LLM does not have the capability to physically manipulate objects or perform tasks that require physical dexterity.
- While the LLM could potentially provide information on cutting techniques or safety guidelines related to cable cutting, the primary action of physically cutting the cables cannot be directly assisted by the LLM.

Based on these considerations, the task of cutting cables and tubing in this occupation is best classified as E0 - No exposure.

2: E0
