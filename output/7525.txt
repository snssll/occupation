1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of identifying sustainable alternatives to industrial or waste-management practices for Industrial Ecologists, we need to consider the level of exposure to LLM.

- E0: This task involves a high level of expertise in understanding environmental impacts, regulations, and sustainable practices. It requires in-depth knowledge of industrial processes and waste management. The task does not involve direct text-based interactions or data analysis that could be significantly expedited by an LLM.

- E1: While an LLM could potentially assist in providing general information on sustainable practices or environmental regulations, the task of identifying specific sustainable alternatives to industrial or waste-management practices requires specialized knowledge and expertise that goes beyond what an LLM can provide. The task involves complex decision-making based on detailed understanding of environmental impacts and industry-specific considerations.

- E2: An LLM-powered application could potentially be developed to assist Industrial Ecologists by summarizing the latest research on sustainable practices, regulations, and industry trends. It could also help in retrieving up-to-date information on new technologies or best practices in waste management. However, the task of identifying sustainable alternatives still heavily relies on domain-specific knowledge and expertise that may not be fully captured by an LLM alone.

- E3: The task of identifying sustainable alternatives to industrial or waste-management practices does not significantly benefit from image capabilities. This task is primarily text-based and requires in-depth understanding of environmental science, industrial processes, and waste management principles.
