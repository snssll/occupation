1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of calculating potential energy savings by comparing estimated energy consumption of a proposed design to baseline standards for Architects, Except Landscape and Naval, we need to consider the nature of the task and the capabilities of the LLM.

- The task involves analyzing and comparing energy consumption data, which can be done through text input and output.
- The LLM can assist in performing calculations, analyzing data, and providing insights based on the input provided.
- The LLM can help in summarizing complex information related to energy consumption and standards.
- The task does not involve precise measurements or detailed visuals that would require direct human interaction.

Based on these considerations, the task can be significantly expedited and improved in quality by using the LLM to assist in analyzing and comparing energy consumption data, making it suitable for the E1 label.
