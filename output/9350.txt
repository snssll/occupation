1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of maintaining an understanding of current web technologies or programming practices, we need to consider how the task can be completed with the help of the LLM. In this case, the LLM can assist by providing up-to-date information on web technologies and programming practices through text input and output. The model can summarize recent developments, provide insights from professional conferences, workshops, or groups, and even generate questions for further exploration. Since the task involves staying informed and educated, the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to gather relevant information and resources.

Considering the capabilities of the LLM to provide text-based information and updates, the task of maintaining an understanding of current web technologies or programming practices aligns with E1 exposure. The LLM can efficiently assist in researching, summarizing, and staying up-to-date with the latest trends in the field, thereby reducing the time required for this task.
