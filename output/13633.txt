1: In this task, a Sales Representative of Services is required to quote prices, credit terms, contract terms, or fulfillment dates for services. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves providing specific information related to pricing, credit terms, contracts, and fulfillment dates, which can be effectively communicated through text.
- The task does not require specialized domain knowledge beyond what the LLM can provide.
- The task does not involve complex data analysis or decision-making that would require human judgment.
- The task primarily involves written communication and information dissemination.

Based on these considerations, the task falls under E1 as it involves writing and transforming text according to specific instructions, which can be efficiently handled by the LLM.
