1: In this task, a Fast Food and Counter Worker is responsible for notifying kitchen personnel of shortages or special orders. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves communicating information between different parts of the restaurant, which can be easily done through written or spoken communication. An LLM can assist in drafting clear and concise messages to notify the kitchen personnel effectively.
- The task does not require specialized domain knowledge or complex data analysis. It is a straightforward communication task that can benefit from the LLM's language generation capabilities.
- While the task involves some level of decision-making (deciding when to notify kitchen personnel), the decision-making process is relatively simple and does not require human judgment that impacts livelihood.
- The task does not involve precise measurements, detailed visuals, or physical interactions, making it suitable for automation through text-based communication.

Based on these considerations, the task of notifying kitchen personnel of shortages or special orders aligns best with the E1 label. The LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to draft and communicate these notifications effectively.
