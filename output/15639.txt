1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of sending notices to taxpayers when accounts are delinquent as a Tax Examiner or Revenue Agent, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be supported by the capabilities of the LLM. 

- Tax examiners and revenue agents typically need to follow specific guidelines and regulations when sending notices to taxpayers. The task involves drafting and sending out official communications that are accurate, clear, and compliant with tax laws.
- The LLM can assist in generating written content, including drafting letters or notices based on provided information. It can help ensure that the language used is appropriate and professional.
- While the LLM can aid in the writing process, it may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task, as the main challenge lies in the accuracy and compliance of the content rather than the writing itself.
- The task does not involve complex decision-making or specialized domain knowledge that would require additional software beyond the LLM's capabilities.

Based on these considerations, the task of sending notices to taxpayers when accounts are delinquent would likely fall under **E2 - Exposure by LLM-powered applications**. While the LLM can assist in generating the written content, additional software tailored to tax regulations and compliance might further enhance the efficiency of completing this task.
