1: For the task of baking breads, rolls, cakes, and pastries as a Restaurant Cook, the exposure to LLM can be evaluated as follows:

- E0: This task involves hands-on skills and physical work in a kitchen setting, which cannot be replaced by the LLM or any software tools. The LLM cannot physically bake items, so it cannot significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task.

- E1: The LLM could potentially provide recipes, tips, or instructions for baking various items, but the actual baking process still requires manual work and expertise in handling ingredients, temperatures, and timing. While the LLM can offer some assistance in terms of providing information, it cannot directly perform the task of baking.

- E2: It is conceivable that additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to assist with recipe suggestions, ingredient substitutions, or troubleshooting common baking issues. This software could potentially streamline the preparation process and provide more tailored guidance for specific recipes or dietary restrictions.

- E3: Given the limitations of the LLM and the lack of image capabilities to view or create detailed images of baking processes, it is unlikely that the LLM combined with image capabilities would significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task of baking breads, rolls, cakes, and pastries.
