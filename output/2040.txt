1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of cleaning laboratory facilities as a Chemistry Teacher, Postsecondary, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task of cleaning laboratory facilities involves physical actions such as wiping down surfaces, disposing of waste, and organizing equipment. These actions cannot be directly performed by the LLM or any software built on top of it. The task does not involve writing, summarizing, analyzing text, or any other activity that the LLM is designed to assist with. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM or any tools built on top of it.

2: E0
