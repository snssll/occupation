1: Special Education Teachers, Kindergarten, often visit schools to tutor students with sensory impairments or consult with teachers regarding students' special needs. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task. In this case, the task involves physical presence at schools, direct interaction with students and teachers, and hands-on tutoring. The task also requires assessing students' needs in real-time, which may involve observing behaviors and interactions that cannot be captured solely through text input and output. As such, the task does not seem suitable for automation or assistance solely through the LLM.
