1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of participating in mediation and dispute resolution as an Industrial-Organizational Psychologist, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be impacted by the use of a large language model (LLM).

- E1: Direct exposure - If the task involves a significant amount of written communication, such as drafting mediation agreements, providing feedback on dispute resolution strategies, or preparing reports on conflict resolution techniques, then the LLM could be used to assist in generating these written materials efficiently. The LLM could help in crafting responses, drafting documents, or summarizing key points related to mediation and dispute resolution.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not reduce the time it takes to complete the task by half, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to enhance the efficiency of tasks related to mediation and dispute resolution. This software could include tools for summarizing case studies, analyzing conflict resolution strategies, or providing recommendations based on data gathered during mediation sessions.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Since the task of participating in mediation and dispute resolution primarily involves verbal communication and written documentation, image capabilities are not directly relevant to this task. Therefore, this task does not fall under E3.
