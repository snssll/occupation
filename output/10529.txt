1: In this task, a Set and Exhibit Designer is required to observe sets during rehearsals to ensure that set elements do not interfere with performance aspects like cast movement and camera angles. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be significantly aided by the use of text-based information processing. The task involves visual observation and analysis of physical sets, which does not directly align with the capabilities of an LLM. While an LLM could potentially assist in generating written reports or recommendations based on the observations made by the designer, the core task of physically observing and analyzing the sets during rehearsals cannot be directly facilitated by an LLM.
