1: In this task, a critical care nurse is required to monitor patients for changes in status and indications of conditions such as sepsis or shock and institute appropriate interventions. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be significantly aided by the use of the language model. Critical care nurses rely heavily on their medical knowledge, experience, and real-time patient assessments to make critical decisions. While the LLM can provide general information on sepsis, shock, and interventions, the real-time monitoring of patients and the need for immediate interventions based on physical assessments are crucial aspects of this task that cannot be fully replaced by an LLM. Therefore, the task does not significantly benefit from the use of the LLM in reducing the time it takes to complete the task.
