1: In this task, a midwife is required to test patients' hemoglobin, hematocrit, and blood glucose levels. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The LLM is a text-based model that can process and generate text but does not have the ability to physically perform medical tests or analyze biological samples. While the LLM can provide information on medical procedures, it cannot directly carry out the task of testing patients' hemoglobin, hematocrit, and blood glucose levels. Therefore, this task does not fall under E1, E2, or E3 as the LLM alone cannot reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality by at least half.

2: E0

3: High
