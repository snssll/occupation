1: In this task, a Heating, Air Conditioning, and Refrigeration Mechanic and Installer is required to lift and align components into position using a hoist or block and tackle. This task involves physical labor, coordination, and spatial awareness, which are not tasks that can be easily automated by a language model. The task does not involve text input or output, and the context is primarily based on physical actions rather than written instructions. Therefore, the task does not align with the capabilities of the LLM, and there are no tools built on top of the LLM that can assist in completing this task.
