1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of developing plans for investigating alleged computer crimes as a Digital Forensics Analyst, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be aided by the use of a large language model (LLM).

- Digital Forensics Analysts typically require access to a wide range of information sources to develop effective investigation plans. An LLM can assist in researching and understanding various aspects related to computer crimes, legal frameworks, and investigative techniques.
- The task involves analyzing and synthesizing information to create a comprehensive plan. An LLM can help in generating detailed reports, outlining steps, and providing insights based on the input data.
- While the LLM can provide valuable information and suggestions, the task of developing investigation plans may require domain-specific knowledge and expertise that goes beyond what the LLM can offer. This includes understanding legal procedures, forensic tools, and investigative methodologies.
- The task may involve collaboration with other experts and stakeholders, which may not be fully supported by the LLM alone.

Based on these considerations, the task of developing plans for investigating alleged computer crimes as a Digital Forensics Analyst would likely fall under label E2 - Exposure by LLM-powered applications. While the LLM can assist in research, information synthesis, and report generation, additional software tailored to the specific needs of digital forensics analysis could further enhance the efficiency of the task.
