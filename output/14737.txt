1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of researching and analyzing customer design proposals as a Mechanical Engineer, we need to consider the level of exposure to LLM. 

- This task involves analyzing text-based documents such as design proposals, specifications, and manuals to evaluate feasibility, cost, and maintenance requirements.
- The LLM can assist in summarizing and extracting key information from these documents, providing insights and recommendations based on the data analyzed.
- The LLM can also help in generating reports or responses based on the analyzed information, potentially saving time in the process of evaluating designs or applications.

Considering these points, the task can benefit from the direct access to the LLM through interfaces like ChatGPT, which can significantly reduce the time required to analyze and evaluate customer design proposals. Therefore, the task falls under label E1.
