1: In this task, a mortician, undertaker, or funeral arranger is responsible for coordinating and organizing the pallbearers or honorary groups for a funeral service. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- Direct exposure (E1): The task involves communication and coordination, which can be facilitated by the LLM in drafting emails, providing instructions, or even generating scripts for informing pallbearers or honorary groups of their duties. The LLM can assist in composing clear and concise messages, but it may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task.

- Exposure by LLM-powered applications (E2): While the LLM alone may not reduce the time significantly for this task, additional software could be developed to streamline the communication process, provide templates for informing pallbearers, or even offer suggestions based on common practices in the industry. Such software could enhance the efficiency of coordinating pallbearers or honorary groups.

- Exposure given image capabilities (E3): Image capabilities are not relevant for this task as it primarily involves communication and coordination through written or spoken mediums. 

Considering the above points, the task of arranging for pallbearers or informing them of their duties could potentially benefit from additional software tools built on top of the LLM to streamline the process, making it more efficient.
