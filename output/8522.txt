1: Private Detectives and Investigators often need to investigate various financial matters, including companies' financial standings and locating stolen funds. In this specific task, the investigator is required to use accounting skills to analyze financial data and track down missing funds. While the task involves a significant amount of data analysis and research, it does not explicitly require the use of an LLM for completion. The task primarily relies on accounting skills and investigative techniques rather than text generation or analysis. Therefore, the task does not directly benefit from the capabilities of an LLM, as it does not involve writing, summarizing, translating, or generating text. Additionally, the task does not involve image processing or detailed visual analysis. As a result, the task falls under E0 as it does not clearly benefit from the use of an LLM.
