1: For the task of reviewing records to identify titles of overdue materials and delinquent borrowers as a Library Assistant, Clerical, we can consider the following:

- The task involves reading and analyzing text-based records to extract specific information.
- The task does not require specialized domain knowledge beyond basic library procedures.
- The task does not involve complex decision-making or nuanced judgment calls.
- The task can be completed efficiently by a human with basic clerical skills.

Based on these considerations, it is unlikely that access to the LLM would significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task, as it does not involve complex text generation, analysis, or decision-making that would benefit from the LLM's capabilities. Therefore, this task would likely fall under E0 as the exposure to the LLM would not provide a substantial time-saving advantage for an experienced worker.
