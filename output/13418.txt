1: In this task, a nurse midwife is required to provide direct family planning services to patients, including inserting intrauterine devices, dispensing oral contraceptives, and fitting cervical barriers. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. Since the task involves hands-on medical procedures that require physical interaction with patients, precise measurements, and specialized medical knowledge, it is unlikely that access to an LLM alone would significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task. The LLM cannot perform physical procedures or interact directly with patients, making it unsuitable for tasks that involve such activities. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not meet the criteria for exposure to LLM capabilities.
