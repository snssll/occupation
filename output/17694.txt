1: In this task, the Security Guard is required to warn individuals of rule infractions or violations and take action to apprehend or evict violators from the premises, potentially using force when necessary. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves real-time decision-making and physical intervention, which cannot be directly handled by an LLM.
- The task requires human judgment, assessment of the situation, and physical action, which are beyond the capabilities of an LLM.
- The task involves potential legal implications and the use of force, which require human intervention and cannot be automated by an LLM.

Based on these considerations, the task of warning persons of rule infractions, apprehending or evicting violators, and using force when necessary falls under E0 as it involves physical actions, human judgment, and legal implications that cannot be handled by an LLM.
