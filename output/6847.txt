1: In this task, a manicurist or pedicurist is extending nails using powder, solvent, and paper forms attached to the tips of customers' fingers to support and shape artificial nails. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves a hands-on, physical process that requires manual dexterity and skill. It does not involve text input or output, and the context is primarily practical and tactile, rather than informational. The task does not involve complex written instructions, translations, summarizations, or data analysis that could be significantly aided by an LLM. Therefore, the task does not align with the capabilities of an LLM or any tools built on top of it. As a result, this task would be classified as E0 as it does not benefit from LLM exposure.

2: E0

3: High
