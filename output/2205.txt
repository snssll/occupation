1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of collaborating with colleagues to address teaching and research issues as a postsecondary teacher, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be supported by the capabilities of the LLM.

- E1: Direct exposure - If the task involves writing and transforming text to communicate with colleagues, providing feedback on research issues, or generating questions for discussions, the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete these tasks with equivalent quality. The LLM can assist in drafting emails, summarizing research findings, and generating ideas for collaboration.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not reduce the time it takes to collaborate with colleagues, additional software built on top of the LLM could enhance collaboration by summarizing research documents, retrieving up-to-date information for discussions, or providing recommendations based on data analysis. Such tools could streamline the collaboration process and improve decision-making.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Since the task of collaborating with colleagues primarily involves text-based communication and research discussions, image capabilities are not essential for completing this task. Reading text from PDFs or creating/editing digital images is not directly relevant to collaborating on teaching and research issues.

Based on the above analysis, the task of collaborating with colleagues to address teaching and research issues as a postsecondary teacher is best classified as **E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications**.
