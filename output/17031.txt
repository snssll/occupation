1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of testifying in court cases involving fires, suspected arson, and false alarms as a Fire Inspector or Investigator, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it. 

- E0: This task involves human interaction and legal proceedings that require specific expertise and experience in fire investigation. The task also involves providing testimony based on firsthand knowledge and experience, which cannot be effectively replaced by an LLM.

- E1: While an LLM could potentially assist in drafting written reports or summaries related to the investigations, providing legal testimony in court requires real-world experience, expertise, and the ability to respond to unpredictable questions and situations. The LLM may not be able to accurately simulate the nuances and complexities of a courtroom setting.

- E2: An LLM-powered application could potentially help in summarizing case documents, legal precedents, or relevant information for the court case. It could also assist in researching past cases or legal statutes related to fire investigations. However, the core task of testifying in court still heavily relies on human expertise and experience.

- E3: Given the nature of the task, which involves legal proceedings and human interaction, as well as the need for real-world experience and expertise in fire investigations, it is unlikely that image capabilities would significantly impact the completion of this task.
