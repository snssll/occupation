1: In this task, a Stationary Engineer or Boiler Operator is required to monitor boiler water, chemical, and fuel levels and make adjustments to maintain the required levels. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- Direct exposure (E1): The task involves monitoring and making adjustments based on specific levels. An LLM could potentially assist in providing guidelines on how to adjust levels based on certain parameters or conditions. The LLM could also help in generating reports or logs of the levels monitored. Therefore, direct access to the LLM could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality.

- Exposure by LLM-powered applications (E2): While the task involves monitoring and adjusting levels, it may not require highly specialized domain knowledge that would necessitate additional software beyond the LLM itself. The LLM could potentially provide general guidance and information related to boiler operations, but it may not require a separate application to enhance its capabilities for this task.

- Exposure given image capabilities (E3): This task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images. Therefore, image capabilities would not significantly impact the completion of this task.

Based on the above analysis, the task of monitoring boiler water, chemical, and fuel levels and making adjustments to maintain required levels aligns best with the label of Direct exposure (E1).
