1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of designing or maintaining a library website and online catalogues as a Library Assistant, Clerical, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves working with text and potentially some basic web design elements. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM can assist in writing and transforming text, providing edits, and potentially generating basic web design code. It can help in summarizing information for the website or catalogues and providing feedback on content. The LLM can also assist in maintaining records of written data related to the library's collections or services. Therefore, the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality by at least half.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone can handle text-related tasks, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to automate more complex web design tasks, such as creating interactive elements or optimizing the website for search engines. This additional software could further reduce the time needed to complete the task by half.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not essential for this task as it primarily involves text-based content creation and maintenance. Therefore, image capabilities are not directly relevant to this task.
