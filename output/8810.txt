1: In this task, a Mail Clerk or Mail Machine Operator is required to lift and unload containers of mail or parcels onto equipment for transportation to sortation stations. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. This task involves physical labor, specifically lifting and moving containers, which cannot be directly assisted by an LLM. The task does not involve complex decision-making, analysis, or information processing that could benefit significantly from LLM capabilities. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM or any tools built on top of it.
