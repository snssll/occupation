1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of attending meetings to record minutes for Executive Secretaries and Executive Administrative Assistants, we need to consider how the task can be impacted by the use of the LLM. 

- E0: This task involves attending meetings in person, listening to discussions, and accurately recording minutes. The LLM cannot physically attend meetings or listen to verbal discussions, so it cannot directly assist in this task. Additionally, the task requires real-time interaction and decision-making based on the context of the meeting, which the LLM is not capable of doing.

- E1: While the LLM can potentially assist in preparing templates for meeting minutes or formatting the recorded minutes based on provided information, it cannot actively attend meetings or record real-time discussions. The core aspect of attending meetings and recording minutes in real-time is not something the LLM can directly help with.

- E2: It is conceivable that additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to assist in summarizing meeting discussions based on provided audio recordings or notes. This software could potentially automate the process of extracting key points from meetings and generating draft minutes. However, this would require advanced speech-to-text capabilities and real-time processing, which are not currently within the LLM's capabilities.

- E3: The task of attending meetings to record minutes does not involve image processing or creation, so the image capabilities of the LLM would not significantly impact the completion of this task.
