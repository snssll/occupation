1: For the task of picking up and delivering items or running errands for guests as a concierge, the exposure to LLM can be evaluated as follows:

- E0: This task involves physical actions such as picking up and delivering items, which cannot be performed by the LLM or any system built on top of it. The task also requires human interaction with guests, which cannot be replaced by the LLM.

- E1: The LLM could potentially assist in generating written instructions or communication related to the errands or items to be picked up and delivered. It could help in composing emails or messages to inform guests about the status of their requests. However, the core task of physically picking up and delivering items cannot be directly performed by the LLM.

- E2: While the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task, additional software could potentially be developed to manage and track the errands or items to be picked up and delivered. This software could integrate with the LLM to provide automated updates to guests or suggest efficient routes for the concierge.

- E3: The task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images, so the image capabilities of the LLM are not relevant in this context.
