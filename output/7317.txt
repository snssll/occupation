1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of helping production workers as a Helper--Production Worker, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be impacted by the use of the LLM.

- The task involves performing duties of lesser skill, such as supplying materials, holding tools, and cleaning work areas and equipment. These duties are practical and hands-on, requiring physical presence and manual labor.
- The task does not involve complex decision-making, critical thinking, or specialized knowledge that would benefit significantly from the capabilities of the LLM.
- The task is more about physical assistance and support rather than information processing or analysis that the LLM excels at.
- While the LLM could potentially provide written instructions or guidance on how to perform certain tasks, the core of the work involves physical actions that cannot be directly replaced by text-based assistance.

Based on these considerations, the task of helping production workers as a Helper--Production Worker would be classified as E0 - No exposure to the LLM.
