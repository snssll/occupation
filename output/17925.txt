1: In this task, a Neuropsychologist Clinical Neuropsychologist is required to write or prepare detailed clinical neuropsychological reports using various sources of data. With access to the powerful OpenAI large language model (LLM), the neuropsychologist could potentially use the model to assist in generating parts of the report, summarizing test results, providing insights based on the data, and even formatting the report. The LLM could help in transforming the raw data into coherent written reports, saving time and effort for the neuropsychologist.

Considering the nature of the task and the capabilities of the LLM, it falls under E1 exposure. The LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task by assisting in writing and transforming text according to complex instructions, providing edits to existing text following specifications, and summarizing data to generate parts of the report.
