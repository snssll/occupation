1: In this task, an aerospace engineer is required to formulate mathematical models or other methods of computer analysis to develop, evaluate, or modify designs according to customer engineering requirements. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- Writing and transforming text and code according to complex instructions: The task involves formulating mathematical models and computer analysis methods, which may require writing complex code or instructions.
- Providing edits to existing text or code following specifications: The engineer may need to edit existing code or models to meet customer requirements.
- Writing code that can help perform a task that used to be done by hand: The engineer may need to write code to automate certain design processes.
- Analyzing written information to inform decisions: The engineer will analyze engineering requirements to develop suitable designs.
- Prepare training materials based on general knowledge: The task involves applying specialized knowledge in aerospace engineering rather than general knowledge.

Considering these points, the task can be significantly aided by the LLM in providing guidance on formulating mathematical models, writing code, and analyzing engineering requirements. The LLM can assist in generating ideas, providing code snippets, and offering insights into complex engineering concepts.
