1: In this task, an Advertising and Promotions Manager is responsible for planning and preparing advertising and promotional material to increase sales of products or services. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if direct access to the LLM could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality. The LLM could assist in generating creative advertising copy, drafting promotional materials, providing market research insights, suggesting advertising strategies, and even analyzing customer feedback to tailor campaigns. While the LLM can be a valuable tool for generating ideas and content, it may not significantly reduce the time it takes to collaborate with customers, company officials, sales departments, and advertising agencies, which involves human interaction and decision-making beyond text generation.
