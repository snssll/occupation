1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of negotiating prices and terms with suppliers, vendors, or freight forwarders as a Supply Chain Manager, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it.

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM could assist in drafting negotiation emails, providing suggested terms or strategies based on historical data, or even simulating potential outcomes of different negotiation approaches. The model's ability to generate text and provide insights could significantly reduce the time and effort required for preparing negotiation materials.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not reduce the time to complete the negotiation task by half, additional software could be developed to analyze market trends, competitor pricing, or supplier performance data to provide real-time recommendations during negotiations. Such software could enhance the negotiation process and improve decision-making.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities would not be relevant for negotiating prices and terms with suppliers, vendors, or freight forwarders, as the task primarily involves written communication and data analysis rather than image processing.
