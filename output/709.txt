1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of answering customers' questions and explaining available services as a New Accounts Clerk, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be supported by the capabilities of the LLM.

- The task involves providing information to customers about financial services, which can be effectively supported by the LLM's ability to generate text and provide explanations based on input data.
- The LLM can assist in crafting responses to common customer inquiries, explaining complex financial terms in simple language, and providing accurate information about deposit accounts, bonds, and securities.
- While the task may involve some level of customization based on individual customer needs, the LLM can still significantly reduce the time required to generate responses and explanations.
- The LLM can also help in maintaining records of customer interactions and inquiries, ensuring accurate and consistent information is provided.

Based on these considerations, the task of answering customers' questions and explaining available services aligns best with the E1 label, as direct access to the LLM can reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality by at least half.
