1: In this task, a school psychologist is required to collaborate with other educational professionals to develop teaching strategies and school programs. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves collaboration, communication, and strategizing, which are primarily human-centric activities that require interpersonal skills, understanding of educational systems, and empathy. While an LLM could potentially assist in generating written materials or providing information on educational strategies, the core of this task involves human interaction, decision-making, and understanding the specific needs of the educational environment. The LLM may not significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced school psychologist to complete this task with high quality, as the essence of the task lies in the human element of collaboration and program development.
