1: In this task, the helper-electrician is required to disassemble defective electrical equipment, replace defective or worn parts, and reassemble the equipment using hand tools. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves physical actions such as disassembling and reassembling equipment using hand tools, which cannot be directly performed by an LLM.
- The task does not involve complex decision-making or specialized knowledge that would significantly benefit from LLM capabilities.
- While the LLM could potentially provide information on how to disassemble or reassemble equipment, the physical aspect of the task cannot be directly assisted by the LLM.

Based on these considerations, the task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM to reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete the task.

2: E0
