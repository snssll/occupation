1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of developing defense plans or tactics as an Intelligence Analyst, we need to consider the level of exposure to LLM.

- E1: Direct exposure - In this task, an Intelligence Analyst would heavily rely on analyzing intelligence and other information to develop defense plans or tactics. The LLM could assist in providing insights, generating alternative strategies, or helping with the decision-making process by processing and summarizing large amounts of text data related to intelligence. The LLM could also assist in drafting reports or recommendations based on the analysis conducted. Therefore, direct access to the LLM could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone could be beneficial in providing text-based analysis and insights, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to enhance the capabilities for an Intelligence Analyst. This software could include features like summarizing vast amounts of intelligence data, retrieving up-to-date information from various sources, or even providing recommendations based on the analysis conducted by the LLM.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities would not significantly impact the task of developing defense plans or tactics for an Intelligence Analyst, as the primary focus is on analyzing text-based intelligence and information rather than visual data.

Based on the analysis above, the task of developing defense plans or tactics as an Intelligence Analyst would likely fall under E1: Direct exposure to the LLM.

2: E1

3: Moderate
