1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of directing activities of workers in constructing and improving equipment, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it. 

- Direct exposure (E1): The task involves providing instructions and guidance to workers involved in construction and improvement activities. The LLM could assist in generating detailed instructions, explanations, or guidelines for the workers based on the specific requirements of the equipment. It could also help in communicating effectively with the workers to ensure clarity in instructions.

- Exposure by LLM-powered applications (E2): While the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time it takes to direct workers in construction activities, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to streamline the process. This software could include tools for visualizing construction plans, generating step-by-step instructions, or even simulating construction processes to identify potential issues beforehand.

- No exposure (E0): If the task requires hands-on supervision, physical presence, or real-time decision-making that cannot be effectively replaced by the LLM, then it would fall under E0.

Considering the nature of the task and the potential for the LLM to assist in providing detailed instructions and guidance, the most appropriate label seems to be Exposure by LLM-powered applications (E2).
