1: In this task, the worker is required to operate hoists to position dies or patterns on foundry floors. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone or with additional software could significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality.

- E0: This task involves physical operation of hoists and positioning of dies or patterns, which cannot be directly assisted by the LLM or any software tools. The task also requires hands-on work and precise movements, which cannot be replaced by text-based assistance.

- E1: The task does not involve writing, transforming text, or providing edits to existing text. It is a hands-on task that requires physical operation of machinery. The LLM cannot directly assist in operating hoists or positioning dies.

- E2: While it is conceivable that specialized software could be developed to assist in the operation of hoists or provide guidance on positioning dies, the current capabilities of the LLM do not directly apply to this task. The task is more practical and physical in nature, requiring manual skills that cannot be easily replaced by text-based tools.

- E3: The task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images. It is a hands-on task that involves physical manipulation of equipment.

2: E0

3: High
