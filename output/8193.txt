1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of installing solar thermal system controllers and sensors as a Solar Thermal Installer and Technician, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be aided by the use of the OpenAI large language model (LLM).

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** If the task involves complex instructions, specifications, or guidance that can be provided in text form and the LLM can assist in understanding and executing these instructions efficiently, then it would fall under E1. For example, if there are detailed steps, troubleshooting tips, or best practices for installing solar thermal system controllers and sensors that can be communicated effectively through text, the LLM can help in comprehending and following these instructions accurately.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** If there are specialized tools or software applications that could be developed on top of the LLM to streamline the installation process, provide real-time data on system configurations, or offer recommendations based on the latest industry standards, then the task might fall under E2. For instance, an application that integrates with the LLM to access up-to-date information on solar thermal technology advancements could enhance the technician's efficiency in installing the systems.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Since the task of installing solar thermal system controllers and sensors primarily involves physical installation work rather than detailed visual analysis, it is unlikely to benefit significantly from image capabilities. Image capabilities are more suited for tasks like reading text from technical diagrams or inspecting intricate visual details, which are not central to the installation process in this case.
