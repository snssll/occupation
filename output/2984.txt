1: In this task, a Compliance Manager is responsible for conducting or directing internal investigations of compliance issues within an organization. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it. 

- E0: This task involves a high degree of human interaction and decision-making that impacts human livelihood. Compliance investigations often require nuanced judgment, interviews, and analysis that may not be effectively handled by an LLM alone. Additionally, legal requirements and ethical considerations may necessitate human involvement in conducting such investigations.

- E1: While the LLM could potentially assist in providing information or guidance on compliance regulations and best practices, conducting internal investigations involves complex interactions, interviews, and decision-making that may not be easily automated by the LLM. The task also involves sensitive information and legal implications that require human oversight.

- E2: An LLM-powered application could potentially assist Compliance Managers by summarizing relevant compliance regulations, providing recommendations based on data analysis, or retrieving information from internal documents. However, the task of conducting internal investigations still requires human judgment, interviewing skills, and the ability to navigate complex organizational dynamics.

- E3: Given the limitations of the LLM in handling detailed human interactions, conducting internal investigations, especially in compliance matters, would likely not benefit significantly from image capabilities. The task primarily involves text-based information, interviews, and analysis rather than image processing.
