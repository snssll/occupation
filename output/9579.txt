1: In this task, a Lighting Technician is required to match light fixture settings to lighting design plans, adjusting brightness and color accordingly. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- E0: This task involves hands-on work that requires physical adjustments to light fixtures based on design plans. It does not involve text-based instructions or data processing that could be significantly expedited by an LLM.

- E1: While an LLM could potentially provide information on lighting design principles or suggest adjustments based on general guidelines, the core task of physically matching light fixture settings to design plans is not something that can be directly automated or expedited by an LLM. The hands-on nature of the task and the need for practical adjustments make it unlikely that the use of an LLM would reduce the time significantly.

- E2: It is conceivable that specialized software could be developed to assist Lighting Technicians by generating lighting design plans based on input parameters or by simulating different settings virtually. However, this would go beyond the capabilities of a standard LLM and would require a more specialized tool tailored to the lighting industry.

- E3: The task does not involve image processing, reading text from images, or creating/editing digital images. Therefore, the use of image capabilities alongside an LLM would not significantly reduce the time required to complete the task.
