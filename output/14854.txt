1: In this task, a midwife is required to respond to breech birth presentations by applying methods such as exercises or external version. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. Responding to breech birth presentations involves specialized medical knowledge and skills that go beyond general information available in the LLM. The task requires hands-on intervention and decision-making based on real-time assessment of the situation, which cannot be effectively performed by the LLM alone. While the LLM can provide general information on breech births, it cannot replace the expertise and experience of a midwife in handling such situations.
