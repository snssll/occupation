1: In this task, a Continuous Mining Machine Operator is required to determine the locations, boundaries, and depths of holes or channels to be cut. This task involves a high level of precision and expertise in operating heavy machinery to excavate materials. The task does not involve writing, summarizing text, or any form of document analysis that could be significantly aided by an LLM. The task also does not involve image processing or analysis that could benefit from image capabilities. Since the task requires physical operation of machinery and precise measurements, it falls under the category of tasks that cannot be effectively assisted by an LLM or LLM-powered tools. Therefore, this task would be classified as E0.
