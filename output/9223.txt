1: In this task, a Fitness and Wellness Coordinator is responsible for maintaining or arranging maintenance for fitness equipment or facilities. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality. 

- E0: This task involves physical maintenance of equipment and facilities, which cannot be directly performed by the LLM or any software tool built on top of it. The task requires hands-on work and cannot be completed solely through text-based interactions with the LLM.
- E1: The LLM cannot physically maintain equipment or facilities, so it cannot directly perform this task. While the LLM could potentially provide written instructions or guidelines for maintenance, the actual maintenance work would still need to be carried out manually.
- E2: It is conceivable that software could be developed on top of the LLM to help with scheduling maintenance, providing guidelines for maintenance procedures, or even connecting with maintenance service providers. However, this would not reduce the time it takes to complete the task by at least half, as the physical maintenance work would still need to be done.
- E3: Image capabilities would not significantly impact the completion of this task, as it does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images.

Based on the above analysis, the most appropriate label for this task is E0.

2: E0

3: High
