1: In this task, a Museum Technician or Conservator is responsible for coordinating exhibit installations, assisting with design, constructing displays, dioramas, display cases, and models, and ensuring the availability of necessary materials. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be significantly aided by the language model. The LLM could potentially assist in providing information on exhibit design principles, construction techniques, materials sourcing, and even generating text for labels or descriptions. It could also help in researching historical or artistic context for exhibits. However, the task involves physical construction and coordination, which may not be directly impacted by the LLM's capabilities. While the model can provide information and guidance, it cannot physically construct displays or ensure material availability.
