1: In this task, an Adapted Physical Education Specialist is required to request or order physical education equipment following standard procedures. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. Since the task involves requesting or ordering physical education equipment, it primarily involves written communication and following standard procedures. This task does not require specialized domain knowledge beyond standard procedures for ordering equipment. The task does not involve complex decision-making, analysis, or creativity that would significantly benefit from the capabilities of an LLM. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not clearly decrease the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete the task with high quality by at least half.
