1: In this task, a Pest Control Worker is required to clean the work site after completing a job. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be aided by the use of a large language model (LLM).

- **E0**: This task involves physical work that cannot be automated by an LLM. Cleaning a work site typically requires manual labor and physical presence, which cannot be replaced by text-based AI models.

- **E1**: While an LLM could potentially provide instructions or guidelines on how to clean a work site effectively, the actual cleaning process itself cannot be performed by the model. The task involves physical actions that cannot be completed through text-based interactions alone.

- **E2**: It is challenging to imagine additional software built on top of an LLM that could significantly reduce the time it takes to clean a work site after a pest control job. The task is straightforward and does not involve complex decision-making or specialized knowledge that would benefit from LLM-powered applications.

- **E3**: Image capabilities would not significantly aid in cleaning a work site after a pest control job. The task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images. It is primarily a physical task that does not rely on visual or image-related information.
