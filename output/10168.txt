1: In this task, a Purchasing Agent is responsible for monitoring shipments to ensure timely delivery and resolving any issues related to undelivered goods. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we can break down the task:
- Monitoring shipments involves tracking the status of orders, checking delivery schedules, and ensuring goods arrive on time. This task can benefit from the LLM's ability to process and analyze text data to provide updates on shipment statuses.
- Resolving problems related to undelivered goods may require communication skills to follow up with suppliers, logistics companies, or other parties involved. The LLM can assist in drafting emails, formulating responses, or providing suggestions on how to address specific issues.

Considering the task involves a significant amount of written communication, data analysis, and problem-solving, the LLM can be used to streamline these processes, provide relevant information, and assist in decision-making related to resolving shipment issues. Therefore, this task falls under E1 as the LLM can reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality by at least half.
