1: In this task, the Nuclear Medicine Technologists are responsible for detecting and mapping radiopharmaceuticals in patients' bodies using a camera to produce images. To complete this task, the technologists need to have a deep understanding of nuclear medicine procedures, patient care, and imaging technology. The task involves capturing images, analyzing them, and interpreting the results to aid in patient diagnosis and treatment.

Considering the task description, the exposure to LLM can be classified as E0. This task involves hands-on work with patients, operating specialized equipment, and interpreting complex medical images. While the LLM can provide information on nuclear medicine procedures and general knowledge about radiopharmaceuticals, it cannot replace the practical skills and expertise required to perform the imaging procedures accurately.
