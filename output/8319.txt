1: In this task, the Railroad Conductors and Yardmasters are responsible for instructing workers to set warning signals in front and at the rear of trains during emergency stops. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves providing specific instructions related to safety procedures during emergency stops, which can be communicated effectively through text.
- The task does not require specialized domain knowledge beyond the general understanding of railroad operations and safety protocols.

- The task is primarily focused on conveying instructions clearly and concisely.

Based on these considerations, the task falls under E1 as it involves providing clear instructions that can be effectively communicated through text, aligning with the capabilities of the LLM to assist in writing and transforming text according to complex instructions.
