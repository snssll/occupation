1: In this task, the Bridge and Lock Tenders are responsible for ensuring the safety of bridges before opening them. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves a straightforward check for the presence of vehicles and pedestrians on bridges before they are opened. This task does not require complex decision-making, specialized domain knowledge, or the use of image capabilities. The task primarily involves following a simple set of instructions to ensure safety.

Given that the task is routine and does not involve complex data analysis, specialized knowledge, or image processing, it is unlikely that access to the LLM would significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task. The task does not involve writing, summarizing, translating, or any other text-based activities where the LLM could provide substantial assistance. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as the LLM is not likely to reduce the time needed to complete it significantly.
