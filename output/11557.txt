1: In this task, a taxi driver, shuttle driver, or chauffeur is required to perform minor vehicle repairs like cleaning spark plugs or take vehicles to mechanics for servicing. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it. 

- E0: This task involves physical actions such as cleaning spark plugs or taking vehicles to mechanics, which cannot be directly assisted by the LLM. The LLM does not have the capability to perform physical tasks or interact with vehicles in the real world. Therefore, this task does not benefit from LLM exposure.

- E1: The LLM could potentially assist in providing information on how to clean spark plugs or what steps are involved in minor vehicle repairs. It could also help in drafting communication to mechanics for servicing. However, the actual physical act of performing the repairs or taking the vehicle to the mechanic cannot be done by the LLM. The assistance provided by the LLM in this task is limited to information and communication.

- E2: While the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to provide step-by-step guides for minor vehicle repairs or to automate communication with mechanics. This software could potentially streamline the process and make it more efficient.

- E3: The task does not involve any image-related capabilities that would significantly benefit from the LLM's image capabilities.
