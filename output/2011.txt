1: In this task, the Ship Engineers are responsible for cleaning engine parts and maintaining the cleanliness of engine rooms on ships. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM or LLM-powered tools can significantly reduce the time it takes for Ship Engineers to complete the task of cleaning engine parts and maintaining engine rooms clean.

- Ship Engineers typically perform physical tasks that involve manual labor, such as cleaning engine parts. The task does not involve complex decision-making, analysis of data, or specialized knowledge that would benefit significantly from LLM capabilities.
- The task of cleaning engine parts and maintaining engine rooms clean is hands-on and requires physical presence, which cannot be replaced by text-based tools like the LLM.
- While the LLM could potentially provide information on best practices for cleaning engine parts or suggest cleaning solutions, the actual cleaning process itself cannot be automated or significantly expedited by the LLM.

Based on these considerations, the task of cleaning engine parts and keeping engine rooms clean is best classified as E0 - No exposure to LLM.
