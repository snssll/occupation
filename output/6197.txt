1: In this task, a Special Education Teacher in an Elementary School needs to establish and communicate clear objectives for all lessons, units, and projects to students. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we can break down the task as follows:

- Writing and transforming text: The task involves creating written objectives for lessons, units, and projects, which can be done using the LLM.
- Providing edits to existing text: The teacher may need to revise and refine the objectives based on feedback or changes, which can also be facilitated by the LLM.
- Providing feedback on documents: The LLM can assist in providing feedback on the clarity and effectiveness of the objectives.
- Informing anyone of any information via any written or spoken medium: The task involves communicating objectives to students, which can be done through written or spoken communication facilitated by the LLM.

Based on these considerations, the task can be significantly expedited and improved in quality by using the LLM to assist in writing, editing, providing feedback, and communicating objectives.
