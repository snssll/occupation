1: In this task, a paperhanger is required to mark vertical guidelines on walls to align strips using plumb bobs and chalk lines. This task involves physical work and precise measurements, which cannot be directly assisted by an LLM. The task does not involve complex decision-making or specialized knowledge that would benefit significantly from LLM capabilities. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not clearly decrease the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete the task with high quality by at least half.

2: E0

3: High
