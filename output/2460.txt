1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of collecting, analyzing, and interpreting data as a Political Scientist, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM in assisting with this task. The LLM can help with tasks such as summarizing documents, providing feedback on documents, analyzing written information to inform decisions, and making recommendations given data or written input. In this case, the task involves data analysis, interpretation, and reporting, which align well with the LLM's capabilities to analyze written information and provide recommendations based on data. While the LLM may not have direct access to the latest election results or public opinion surveys unless provided in the input, it can assist in analyzing and interpreting the data once it is available within the 2000-word context limit. Therefore, this task falls under E1 as the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality by at least half.
