1: In this task, the occupation involves attending to guests in locker rooms, coatrooms, and dressing rooms. The specific task is to refer guest problems or complaints to supervisors. To complete this task, the attendant needs to have good communication skills, empathy, and the ability to handle customer complaints effectively. The task itself does not involve complex data analysis, specialized domain knowledge, or image processing. It primarily requires understanding the guest's concerns and escalating them to the appropriate authority. Therefore, the task does not directly benefit from the capabilities of the LLM, as it does not involve text transformation, data retrieval, or decision-making based on written information.
