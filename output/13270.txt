1: In this task, the Reservation and Transportation Ticket Agents and Travel Clerks are required to provide customers with travel suggestions and information sources like guides, directories, brochures, or maps. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The LLM can assist in generating text, providing information, and summarizing documents. For this task, the LLM can help in generating travel suggestions, summarizing information from guides or directories, and providing relevant information to customers. While the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes to gather and present this information to customers, it may not be able to access up-to-date information unless provided in the input. Therefore, this task falls under E1 as the LLM can directly assist in completing the task with equivalent quality by providing travel suggestions and information sources.
