1: In this task, an umpire, referee, or sports official is required to resolve claims of rule infractions or complaints by participants and assess any necessary penalties according to regulations. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. This task involves making decisions based on real-time observations, understanding complex rules and regulations of the sport, and applying them in a fair and consistent manner. The task also requires interpersonal skills to communicate decisions effectively. Since this task involves real-time judgment calls, human interaction, and physical presence, it cannot be effectively automated or completed by an LLM or any software tool. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not benefit from LLM exposure.
