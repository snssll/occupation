1: In this task for Furniture Finishers, the main activities involve applying various finishing ingredients onto wood surfaces. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it could potentially benefit from the use of a large language model (LLM). 

- E0: This task involves physical work that requires manual dexterity and skill in applying finishes to wood. The task does not involve text-based activities that an LLM could significantly assist with.

- E1: While an LLM could potentially provide information on different finishing techniques or materials, the core aspect of this task involves hands-on work that cannot be directly replaced by text-based assistance. The task does not primarily involve writing, editing, summarizing, or other text-based activities that an LLM excels at.

- E2: It is challenging to imagine additional software built on top of an LLM that could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task. The task is highly practical and requires physical interaction with materials, which an LLM alone cannot facilitate.

- E3: The task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images. The use of image capabilities would not significantly impact the completion of this task.

2: E0

3: High certainty
