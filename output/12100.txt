1: In this task, a Home Health Aide is responsible for planning, purchasing, preparing, or serving meals to patients or family members based on prescribed diets. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be significantly aided by the use of the language model. The task involves following specific dietary requirements and preparing meals accordingly. The LLM could potentially assist in providing recipe ideas, nutritional information, and meal planning tips. However, since the task involves hands-on activities like cooking and serving meals, which cannot be directly performed by the LLM, the model's assistance would be limited to providing information and suggestions related to meal planning.
