1: In this task for Title Examiners, Abstractors, and Searchers, the main activity involves reading search requests to understand the types of title evidence needed, property descriptions, and names of parties involved. This task primarily involves processing text information and extracting relevant details from it. An LLM could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task by providing assistance in understanding complex search requests, extracting key information, and potentially even suggesting relevant title evidence based on the input. The LLM can help in summarizing and organizing the information from search requests, making the process more efficient and accurate.

Considering the nature of the task and the capabilities of the LLM in processing and generating text-based information, this task falls under E1. The LLM can directly assist in reading and interpreting search requests, thereby reducing the time needed to gather the necessary information.
