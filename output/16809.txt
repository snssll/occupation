1: In this task, a radiologist is required to teach nuclear medicine, diagnostic radiology, or other specialties at the graduate educational level. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. Teaching at the graduate educational level involves conveying complex information, providing explanations, answering questions, and engaging in discussions with students. While an LLM could potentially assist in generating lecture notes, providing explanations, or answering questions related to the field of radiology, it may not significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced radiologist to prepare and deliver a high-quality lecture or teaching session. The task also involves a high degree of human interaction, as teaching typically requires direct engagement with students, which cannot be fully replaced by an LLM. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as the use of an LLM alone would not significantly decrease the time it takes for an experienced radiologist to teach at the graduate educational level.
