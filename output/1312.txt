1: In this task, a flight attendant is required to assist passengers in placing carry-on luggage in various storage areas on the plane. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone or with additional software could significantly reduce the time it takes for a flight attendant to complete this task with equivalent quality. 

- E0: This task involves physical interaction with passengers and luggage, which cannot be replaced by text-based tools like the LLM. The task requires hands-on assistance and cannot be completed solely through written or spoken communication.

- E1: The LLM could potentially provide written instructions or guidelines on how to assist passengers with luggage, but it cannot physically perform the task. While it may help in providing information on best practices or communication strategies, the core task of physically assisting passengers with luggage cannot be directly completed by the LLM.

- E2: It is challenging to imagine additional software built on top of the LLM that could significantly reduce the time it takes to assist passengers with luggage. The task is inherently physical and requires human interaction, which cannot be replaced by text-based tools or software.

- E3: The task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images. Therefore, the task does not benefit from image capabilities in conjunction with the LLM.

2: E0

3: Certainty level: High
