1: In this task, an interior designer is required to advise clients on various interior design factors such as space planning, layout, furnishings, color coordination, etc. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it. 

- E0: This task involves direct interaction with clients, understanding their preferences, and providing personalized design recommendations. The task also requires practical knowledge of design principles and spatial planning, which may not be effectively replaced by the LLM alone. The LLM may not have the ability to understand the specific needs and tastes of individual clients or provide hands-on design solutions.

- E1: While the LLM could potentially assist in generating general interior design advice, such as explaining design concepts, providing color coordination tips, or suggesting layout ideas based on standard principles, it may not be able to replace the personalized touch and expertise that a human interior designer offers. The LLM could help in drafting written materials, creating design briefs, or generating initial design concepts based on input provided by the client.

- E2: With additional software development, an LLM-powered application could potentially assist interior designers by summarizing client briefs, retrieving design trends or inspiration from the internet, generating mood boards based on client preferences, or even providing automated design suggestions based on input data. This software could enhance the efficiency of the design process by offering quick access to design resources and recommendations.

- E3: Given the task description, the use of image capabilities alongside the LLM may not significantly impact the completion of the task. While visual aids like mood boards or design sketches are important in interior design, the LLM's text-based capabilities are more relevant for tasks like advising clients on design factors and concepts.
