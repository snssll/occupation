1: In this task, a Museum Technician or Conservator is responsible for preparing artifacts for storage and shipping. This involves handling delicate and valuable objects, ensuring they are properly packed, labeled, and protected during transportation. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the specific actions involved in this task. 

- The task of preparing artifacts for storage and shipping may involve documenting the condition of each artifact, creating detailed packing lists, and ensuring proper handling procedures are followed.
- The task may also require knowledge of conservation techniques to protect artifacts from damage during storage and shipping.
- While the task involves some level of manual work, such as physically packing and labeling artifacts, a significant portion of the task can be described, documented, and planned using text-based instructions.

Considering the nature of the task and the potential for text-based instructions to guide the preparation process, it is likely that access to the LLM could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality. The LLM could assist in generating detailed packing lists, providing information on conservation techniques, and helping to document the condition of artifacts.
