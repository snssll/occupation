1: In this task, a Librarian or Media Collections Specialist is required to set up, adjust, and operate audio-visual equipment for various purposes. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider the following:

- The task involves technical knowledge related to audio-visual equipment, which may not directly benefit from the text-based capabilities of the LLM.
- While the LLM could potentially provide information on operating specific equipment or troubleshooting common issues, the task primarily involves hands-on skills and real-time adjustments during events.
- The LLM may not have the ability to physically set up or adjust equipment, which is a crucial aspect of this task.
- The task does not involve complex decision-making that could be significantly enhanced by the LLM's capabilities.

Considering these points, the task of setting up and operating audio-visual equipment for meetings, events, classes, etc., does not align well with the capabilities of the LLM. The LLM cannot directly assist in the physical aspects of this task, and the technical knowledge required is more practical and hands-on than text-based.
