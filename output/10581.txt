1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of obtaining clearances for the use of recycled plastics in product packaging as a Regulatory Affairs Specialist, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM can assist in completing it. 

- The task involves navigating regulatory requirements and obtaining approvals for a specific use case, which requires understanding complex regulations and guidelines.
- The LLM can assist by providing up-to-date information on regulations related to recycled plastics in product packaging, helping draft documentation for clearance applications, and suggesting strategies for compliance.
- The LLM can also generate sample templates for clearance applications, summarize key points from regulatory documents, and provide insights on best practices in obtaining clearances for similar products.

Based on these considerations, the task falls under E1 as the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to research, draft documents, and strategize for obtaining clearances, ultimately improving efficiency and accuracy in the regulatory affairs process.
