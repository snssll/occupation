1: In this task, a Postal Service Clerk is required to respond to complaints regarding mail theft, delivery problems, and lost or damaged mail. They need to fill out forms and make appropriate referrals for investigation. With access to the powerful OpenAI large language model (LLM), the clerk can efficiently draft responses to complaints, fill out forms accurately, and generate appropriate referrals based on the information provided. The LLM can assist in crafting professional and empathetic responses to customers, ensuring that all necessary details are included. Additionally, the model can provide guidance on the correct procedures to follow for different types of complaints, helping the clerk make accurate referrals for investigation. Overall, the LLM can significantly streamline the process of handling complaints and investigations in a timely and effective manner.

Considering the above points, this task falls under E1 - Direct exposure. The LLM can directly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality by at least half by assisting in drafting responses, filling out forms, and making referrals based on the complaints received.
