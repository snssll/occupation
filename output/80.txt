1: In this task, a Fast Food and Counter Worker is responsible for adding relishes and garnishes to food orders based on specific instructions. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The task involves following specific instructions to add relishes and garnishes to food orders. The LLM could potentially assist in providing detailed instructions or clarifications on how to add specific relishes and garnishes, but the actual physical task of adding them cannot be done through text alone. Therefore, the LLM alone cannot reduce the time significantly for this hands-on task.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While it is conceivable that additional software could be developed to provide visual guides or step-by-step instructions for adding relishes and garnishes, the task itself is primarily physical and hands-on. The LLM alone may not be able to reduce the time it takes to complete this task significantly.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - This task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images. The primary focus is on physically adding relishes and garnishes to food orders based on instructions. Therefore, image capabilities would not significantly impact the completion time of this task.

Based on the analysis above, the most appropriate label for this task is E0 - No exposure.

2: E0

3: High certainty
