1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of providing human factors technical expertise on topics such as advanced user-interface technology development or the role of human users in automated or autonomous sub-systems in advanced vehicle systems, we need to consider the level of automation and assistance that the LLM can provide in completing this task.

- The task involves providing technical expertise on human factors, which may require a deep understanding of human behavior, cognition, and interaction with technology.
- The LLM can assist in generating text-based information, explanations, and insights related to human factors and ergonomics based on the input provided.
- While the LLM can help in generating relevant content and explanations, it may not have the specialized domain knowledge or expertise in human factors engineering to provide in-depth technical insights or analysis.
- The task may involve complex discussions and considerations that go beyond text generation, requiring a nuanced understanding of human factors principles and their application in specific contexts.

Based on these considerations, the task of providing human factors technical expertise is likely to fall under **E2 - Exposure by LLM-powered applications**. While the LLM can assist in generating text-based content and explanations related to human factors, additional software or tools specifically designed to provide specialized domain knowledge and analysis in human factors engineering would further enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of completing this task.
