1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of determining patients' x-ray needs by reading requests or instructions from physicians as a Radiologic Technologist or Technician, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. In this task, the LLM could potentially assist by providing information on common x-ray procedures, safety protocols, and factors to consider when interpreting physician requests. The LLM could also help in understanding medical terminology and guidelines related to x-ray imaging.

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM could assist in providing information on x-ray procedures, safety protocols, and medical terminology, which could significantly reduce the time needed to interpret physician requests accurately.
- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not reduce the time by half, additional software could be developed to summarize complex medical guidelines, provide recommendations based on patient history, or retrieve up-to-date information on specific x-ray procedures.
- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Since this task primarily involves reading text instructions from physicians rather than dealing with detailed images, the image capabilities of the LLM may not significantly impact the time needed to complete the task.

Based on the above analysis, the most suitable label for this task would be E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications.

2: E2

3: Moderate
