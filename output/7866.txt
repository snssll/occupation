1: In this task, a firefighter is required to inspect fire sites after the flames have been extinguished to ensure there is no further danger. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be significantly aided by the use of the language model. The task involves physical inspection of the site, checking for potential hazards, and ensuring safety. While the LLM can provide information on fire safety protocols, it cannot physically inspect the site or assess potential dangers on the ground. Therefore, the task does not involve text-based activities that the LLM can directly assist with, such as writing, summarizing, or providing information. As a result, the task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM.
