1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of supervising undergraduate or graduate teaching, internship, and research work for various postsecondary teachers, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could assist in completing it. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The task involves overseeing and guiding students in their academic pursuits, which may require providing feedback, setting expectations, and evaluating their progress. The LLM could assist in generating feedback templates, suggesting ways to improve teaching methods, or even providing sample research work evaluation criteria. The LLM could also help in creating training materials for teaching assistants or interns. Overall, the LLM could significantly reduce the time needed to complete this task with equivalent quality by providing templates, suggestions, and resources.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone can assist in providing guidance and feedback, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to further streamline the process. This software could include features like automated progress tracking, personalized recommendations for each student, or real-time data analysis to identify areas of improvement. Such software could enhance the efficiency of supervising teaching, internship, and research work, although the LLM alone already provides substantial support.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not directly relevant to the task of supervising teaching, internship, and research work for postsecondary teachers. Therefore, this task does not fall under E3.
