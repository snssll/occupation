1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of developing and maintaining computer databases as a Forest and Conservation Technician, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves organizing and managing data related to forest and conservation efforts, which can be time-consuming and require attention to detail. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM can assist in writing and transforming text and code according to complex instructions, which could be useful for creating and updating database entries. It can also help in maintaining records of written data, which aligns with the task of managing databases. Therefore, the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality by at least half.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone can handle text-based tasks related to database management, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to provide more specialized database management capabilities tailored to the forest and conservation domain. This software could enhance the efficiency of database development and maintenance, but the LLM itself can already provide substantial support.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not directly relevant to the task of developing and maintaining computer databases, so this label does not apply.
