1: In this task, the occupation involves instructing cooks or other workers in the preparation, cooking, garnishing, or presentation of food. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if the task can be significantly enhanced by the use of the LLM. The task involves providing instructions and guidance, which are primarily based on practical knowledge and hands-on experience in the culinary field. While the LLM can provide information and generate text, it may not have the practical experience or sensory capabilities required to effectively instruct in the preparation and cooking of food. The task also involves physical actions such as cooking and garnishing, which are beyond the capabilities of the LLM. Therefore, the task does not seem to benefit significantly from the use of the LLM in reducing the time it takes to complete the task with high quality.
