1: For the task of investigating breaking news developments as a News Analyst, Reporter, or Journalist, the exposure to LLM can be evaluated as follows:

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM can assist in researching background information related to breaking news developments, providing summaries of relevant events, generating questions to ask during interviews, and even drafting initial reports based on the information provided. This can significantly reduce the time required for gathering information and structuring the initial draft of a news story.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone can provide valuable assistance in generating content, additional software could be developed to help in summarizing longer documents, retrieving up-to-date facts from the internet, and analyzing data to inform decisions related to the news story. Such software could further enhance the efficiency of the investigative process.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities would not have a significant impact on investigating breaking news developments, as the task primarily involves text-based research, interviews, and reporting. The LLM's text capabilities are more relevant in this context.

Based on the above analysis, the task of investigating breaking news developments as a News Analyst, Reporter, or Journalist aligns most closely with E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications.
