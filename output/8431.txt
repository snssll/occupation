1: In this task, the Human Resources Assistant is responsible for interviewing job applicants to gather and verify information for screening and evaluation purposes. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves interacting with job applicants, asking questions, and evaluating responses to assess their qualifications. This task heavily relies on human interaction, communication skills, and judgment, which are not easily replicable by an LLM. While an LLM could potentially assist in drafting interview questions or providing background information on applicants, the core aspect of conducting interviews, evaluating non-verbal cues, and making subjective judgments based on responses is best performed by a human. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it requires a high degree of human interaction and decision-making that cannot be effectively replaced by an LLM.
