1: In this task, a psychiatric technician is required to administer oral medications or hypodermic injections following physician's prescriptions and hospital procedures. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. Administering medications involves a hands-on, physical action that requires precise measurements and human interaction. This task cannot be directly performed by an LLM or any software tool. The LLM cannot physically administer medications or injections, and it cannot make decisions that impact human health or safety. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM or any software tool built on top of it.

2: E0

3: High
