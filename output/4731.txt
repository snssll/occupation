1: In this task, a coach or scout is responsible for developing and arranging competition schedules and programs. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- Developing competition schedules and programs involves organizing and structuring information in a specific format. This task requires text input and output, which can be effectively handled by the LLM.
- The task does not involve highly specialized domain knowledge or complex databases that would require additional software beyond the capabilities of the LLM.
- While the task may involve some level of decision-making based on factors like team availability and venue availability, the core aspect of the task is organizing information and creating schedules.
- The task does not involve detailed visuals, precise measurements, or human interaction that would fall under E0.

Based on these considerations, the task of developing and arranging competition schedules and programs aligns most closely with E1, as the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality by providing text input and output capabilities.
