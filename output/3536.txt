1: In this task, a Computer and Information Research Scientist is required to consult with various stakeholders to determine computing needs and system requirements. To complete this task, the scientist would need to gather information, analyze requirements, and communicate effectively with different parties. The LLM could assist in generating questions to ask stakeholders, summarizing the information gathered, providing recommendations based on the input received, and potentially drafting communication materials. The LLM could also help in researching and providing background information on computing needs and system requirements. Overall, the LLM could significantly reduce the time needed to gather and process information for this task.

Based on the above analysis, this task falls under E1 as direct access to the LLM can reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality by at least half.
