1: In this task, historians are required to interview people to gather information about historical events and record oral histories. With access to the powerful OpenAI large language model (LLM), historians could potentially use the model to assist in preparing interview questions, analyzing the gathered information, summarizing the oral histories, and even generating written records based on the interviews. The LLM could help in organizing and structuring the gathered information, making the process more efficient and accurate. However, the task of conducting interviews itself involves human interaction, active listening, empathy, and building rapport with interviewees, which are skills that cannot be fully replaced by the LLM. While the LLM can assist in certain aspects of the task, the core of the task still heavily relies on human interaction and interpretation.
