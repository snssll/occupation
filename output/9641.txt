1: In this task, the occupation involves measuring depths of water using depth-measuring equipment. To complete this task, the individual needs to physically operate the depth-measuring equipment, interpret the readings, and make decisions based on the data collected. This task requires hands-on work and precise measurements that cannot be directly performed by an LLM. The LLM does not have the capability to physically interact with the environment or equipment to measure depths of water. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it cannot be significantly aided by the LLM or any tools built on top of it.

2: E0
