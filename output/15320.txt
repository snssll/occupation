1: In this task of scheduling or facilitating project meetings as a Project Management Specialist, the main activities involve coordinating schedules, setting up meeting times, sending out invitations, preparing agendas, facilitating discussions, and documenting meeting outcomes. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality.

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM can assist in drafting meeting invitations, preparing agendas, and documenting meeting outcomes by generating text based on input instructions. It can also provide suggestions for meeting facilitation techniques. This direct access to the LLM can streamline the process of organizing and conducting project meetings, potentially reducing the time needed for these tasks by at least half.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone can help with text generation related to meetings, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to automate scheduling based on participants' availability, provide real-time meeting summaries, or offer personalized meeting recommendations. Such applications could further enhance efficiency in managing project meetings.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not relevant for the task of scheduling or facilitating project meetings, as it primarily involves text-based communication and coordination.
