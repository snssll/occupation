1: In this task, a Pharmacy Aide is responsible for maintaining and cleaning equipment, work areas, or shelves in a pharmacy setting. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes for a worker to complete this task with high quality. 

- E1: Direct exposure - If the LLM can provide detailed step-by-step instructions on how to efficiently maintain and clean equipment, work areas, or shelves in a pharmacy, then this task could potentially be completed faster with equivalent quality compared to a worker doing it manually. The LLM could provide specific guidance, tips, and best practices for cleaning and organizing in a pharmacy setting.
  
- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not drastically reduce the time it takes to complete this task, it is conceivable that additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to create a virtual training program for Pharmacy Aides. This program could include interactive modules on equipment maintenance, workspace organization, and shelf cleaning, enhancing the efficiency of training and execution of these tasks.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities would not significantly impact the task of maintaining and cleaning equipment, work areas, or shelves in a pharmacy. This task is primarily text-based and does not require image analysis or creation.
