1: In this task, the occupation involves installing watt-hour meters and connecting service drops between power lines and consumers' facilities. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the complexity and nature of the task. 

- The task involves technical knowledge related to electrical systems and installations, which may require specialized domain knowledge beyond what a general LLM can provide.
- The task involves physical work such as connecting service drops, which cannot be directly assisted by an LLM.
- While the task description is clear and specific, it does not involve extensive written text or complex instructions that would benefit significantly from LLM assistance.

Considering these points, it is evident that the task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM in terms of reducing time or enhancing the quality of completion.
