1: For the task of adjusting, connecting, or disconnecting wiring, piping, tubing, and other parts using hand or power tools as a Helper in Installation, Maintenance, and Repair Workers, we need to determine the exposure level to LLM.

- This task involves physical actions such as using hand or power tools, which cannot be directly replaced by LLM capabilities.
- LLM does not have the ability to physically manipulate objects or tools.
- The task does not involve complex decision-making, analysis, or information retrieval that would significantly benefit from LLM's text-based capabilities.
- The task is practical and hands-on, requiring manual dexterity and technical skills that are outside the scope of LLM's capabilities.

Based on these considerations, the task of adjusting, connecting, or disconnecting wiring, piping, tubing, and other parts using hand or power tools as a Helper in Installation, Maintenance, and Repair Workers would be classified as E0 - No exposure.

2: E0

3: High
