1: In this task, a teaching assistant in a postsecondary institution is responsible for preparing or proctoring examinations. With access to the powerful OpenAI large language model (LLM), the task of preparing examinations could be significantly streamlined. The LLM can assist in generating a variety of exam questions, providing explanations for answers, and even creating answer keys. This would save time for the teaching assistant, allowing them to focus on other aspects of their role. However, proctoring examinations involves overseeing the exam-taking process, ensuring academic integrity, and addressing any issues that may arise during the exam. This task requires human presence and interaction, which cannot be fully automated by the LLM. Therefore, while the LLM can enhance the preparation aspect of the task, it cannot fully replace the human element required for proctoring.
