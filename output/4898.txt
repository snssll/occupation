1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of developing ideas for creating dances and keeping notes and sketches to record influences as a choreographer, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves primarily writing and transforming text to record creative ideas and influences. The LLM can assist in generating ideas, providing feedback on the notes, and even summarizing the influences to help in the creative process. The LLM can also help in organizing and maintaining records of the choreographic process. However, since this task does not involve highly specialized domain knowledge or complex databases, and the input is primarily text-based, the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality. Therefore, this task falls under label E1.
