1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of developing design specifications and functional requirements for solar energy systems as a Solar Energy Systems Engineer, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be aided by the use of a large language model (LLM).

- This task involves creating detailed design specifications and functional requirements for solar energy systems, which requires technical knowledge and expertise in the field of solar energy engineering.
- While an LLM can assist in providing general information about solar energy systems, it may not have the specialized domain knowledge required to develop specific design specifications and functional requirements.
- The task involves a high level of technical expertise and understanding of engineering principles related to solar energy systems, which may not be easily replaced by an LLM.
- The LLM may be able to provide some general information or assist in drafting documentation, but the core of the task relies heavily on specialized knowledge and expertise in solar energy engineering.

Based on these considerations, the task of developing design specifications and functional requirements for solar energy systems is best classified as E0 - No exposure.
