1: In this task, a Helper-Roofer needs to check completed roofs to ensure they are watertight. To complete this task, the Helper-Roofer would physically inspect the roofs, looking for any signs of leaks or water damage. This task involves hands-on work and requires the physical presence of the worker at the site to visually inspect the roofs. Since this task cannot be completed solely through text input and output, and it involves physical inspection, it falls under the E0 category as it does not benefit from the capabilities of the LLM.
