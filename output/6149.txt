1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of entering data into computers for use in analyses or reports as a Statistical Assistant, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The task involves straightforward data entry into computers, which can be easily automated using the LLM. The model can assist in transforming text data into a format suitable for analyses or reports, potentially reducing errors and increasing efficiency.
- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the task itself may not require complex analysis or specialized domain knowledge, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to automate data entry processes, perform basic analyses, or generate reports based on the entered data.
- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not relevant for this task as it primarily involves text-based data entry.

Considering the straightforward nature of the task and the LLM's ability to assist in text-based data entry and transformation, the most appropriate label for this task is E1: Direct exposure.

2: E1

3: High
