1: In this task, a Costume Attendant is responsible for participating in the hiring, training, scheduling, or supervision of alteration workers. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with high quality. The task involves human interaction, decision-making, and management aspects that are not directly related to text-based information processing. The LLM cannot make decisions that impact human livelihood, such as hiring, so it cannot directly perform the hiring, training, scheduling, or supervision of alteration workers. Therefore, the task does not align with the capabilities of the LLM or systems built on top of it. As a result, this task falls under E0 as it does not fit the criteria for exposure to LLM capabilities.

2: E0

3: High
