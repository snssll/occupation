1: In this task, the occupation involves setting up and operating machines for extruding, forming, pressing, and compacting. The specific task involves selecting and installing machine components like dies, molds, and cutters based on specifications using hand tools and measuring devices. 

To determine the exposure level, we need to consider if the task can be significantly expedited or improved by using the LLM. The task is very hands-on and requires physical manipulation of tools and components, which cannot be directly assisted by the LLM. The LLM does not have the capability to physically interact with machinery or tools. While the LLM could potentially provide information on specifications or guidelines for setting up the machines, the actual installation of components using hand tools and measuring devices is a manual process that cannot be automated by the LLM.
