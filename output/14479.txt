1: In this task, a Real Estate Sales Agent is responsible for renting or leasing properties on behalf of clients. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves interacting with clients, understanding their needs, finding suitable properties, negotiating terms, and finalizing rental or lease agreements. While the LLM can provide general information about real estate and rental processes, it cannot directly interact with clients, visit properties, or negotiate terms in real-time. Therefore, the task does not involve writing, summarizing, analyzing documents, or any other text-based activities that the LLM could significantly assist with. As a result, the task falls under E0 as it does not meet the criteria for exposure to LLM capabilities.
