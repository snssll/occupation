1: In this task, a parking attendant is required to perform maintenance on cars in storage to protect tires, batteries, or exteriors from deterioration. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task and whether the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete it with high quality.

- The task of performing maintenance on cars involves physical actions such as checking tire pressure, cleaning exteriors, and possibly charging batteries. These actions cannot be directly performed by the LLM.
- The task does not involve complex written or spoken communication that the LLM could assist with.
- The task does not require accessing up-to-date information or specialized knowledge that the LLM could provide.
- There are no documents to summarize, questions to answer, or emails to write related to this task that the LLM could help with.

Based on these considerations, it is clear that the LLM cannot assist in performing the physical maintenance tasks required for this occupation. Therefore, the task falls under label E0 - No exposure.
