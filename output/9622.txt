1: In this task, a Traffic Technician is required to measure and record the speed of vehicular traffic using electrical timing devices or radar equipment. The task involves technical skills and knowledge related to operating and interpreting data from these devices. While an LLM could potentially provide information on the general principles of using such equipment, it cannot physically operate the devices or collect real-time data from traffic. The task also does not involve text input or output that the LLM could directly assist with. Therefore, the task does not fall under E1, E2, or E3 exposure levels as the LLM cannot significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task.

2: E0
