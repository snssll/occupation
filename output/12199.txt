To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. This task involves physical manipulation of materials and machinery, which cannot be directly assisted by an LLM. The task does not involve writing, transforming text, providing edits, summarizing documents, or any other text-based activities that an LLM could significantly assist with.
