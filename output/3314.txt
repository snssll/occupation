1: Special Education Teachers, Preschool, often need to confer with various professionals to develop individual education plans (IEPs) for their students. This task involves communication, collaboration, and planning to ensure the best educational outcomes for children with special needs. While an LLM could potentially assist in providing general information about IEPs, it lacks the specific domain knowledge and expertise required to develop tailored plans for each student. The task also involves a high degree of human interaction and decision-making based on individual student needs, which cannot be fully automated by the LLM. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not significantly benefit from the capabilities of the LLM.
