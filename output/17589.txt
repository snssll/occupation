1: In this task, an Order Clerk is responsible for verifying customer and order information for correctness by checking it against previously obtained information. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM can assist in completing it. 

- The task involves verifying information, which can be done by comparing data and ensuring accuracy.
- The LLM can assist by providing templates for data verification, suggesting common errors to look out for, and offering alternative ways to cross-check information.
- The LLM can also help in generating responses to common customer queries related to order information, which can aid in the verification process.

Based on these considerations, the task can benefit from the LLM's capabilities in providing guidance, templates, and responses related to verifying customer and order information. Therefore, this task falls under label E1 - Direct exposure.
