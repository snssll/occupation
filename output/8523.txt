1: In this task, a First-Line Supervisor of Housekeeping and Janitorial Workers is required to investigate complaints about service and equipment and take corrective action. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves investigating complaints, which may require understanding the context of the complaints, assessing the situation, and deciding on appropriate corrective actions. This task is primarily focused on decision-making based on human judgment and understanding of the specific circumstances. While an LLM could potentially provide general guidance on how to handle complaints or suggest corrective actions based on common scenarios, the specific nature of each complaint and the corrective action needed may vary significantly, requiring human judgment and experience. Therefore, the task does not seem to fit into categories E1, E2, or E3, as it involves a high degree of human interaction, decision-making, and context-specific understanding.

2: E0

3: High
