1: In this task, the airline pilot, copilot, or flight engineer is responsible for filing instrument flight plans with air traffic control to ensure proper coordination of flights with other air traffic. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves writing and transforming text (flight plans) according to specific instructions, which is a task that can be effectively handled by the LLM.
- The LLM can assist in generating the necessary text for the instrument flight plans based on the input provided by the pilot, copilot, or flight engineer.
- The LLM can help in ensuring that the flight plans are accurate and comply with regulations and safety standards.
- While the task may involve some domain-specific knowledge related to aviation regulations, the LLM can still be a valuable tool in assisting with the text generation and coordination aspects of filing instrument flight plans.

Based on these considerations, the task of filing instrument flight plans with air traffic control for airline pilots, copilots, and flight engineers can be classified as E1 - Direct exposure.
