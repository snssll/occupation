1: In this task of tracking animals by checking for signs such as droppings or destruction of vegetation, the main activities involve observing and interpreting environmental cues to locate animals. An LLM could potentially assist by providing information on animal behavior, habitats, and tracking techniques. The model could generate text on common animal signs to look for, tips on tracking specific animals, and best practices for tracking efficiently. However, since this task heavily relies on practical field skills and real-time observation, the LLM may not significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete the task with high quality. While the LLM could provide some general information, the hands-on nature of tracking animals in the wild requires physical presence and experience that cannot be fully replaced by text-based information.
