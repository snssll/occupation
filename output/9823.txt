1: In this task, a Mixing and Blending Machine Setter, Operator, or Tender is responsible for mixing or blending ingredients by starting machines and mixing for specified times. To determine the appropriate label for exposure to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be significantly enhanced by using the LLM. Given that this task involves a physical action of starting machines and monitoring the mixing process, it does not directly involve text input or output that the LLM can assist with. The task does not involve complex instructions, writing, summarizing, analyzing text, or any other text-based activities that the LLM could directly aid with. Therefore, the task does not fall under E1, E2, or E3 categories.
