1: In this task, a First-Line Supervisor of Production and Operating Workers is responsible for requisitioning materials, supplies, equipment parts, or repair services. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves written communication to request specific items or services.
- The task does not require specialized domain knowledge beyond general knowledge of the industry.
- The task does not involve complex decision-making or analysis that would benefit significantly from the LLM's capabilities.
- The task does not involve creating or editing digital images, reading text from PDFs, or any other image-related activities.

Based on these considerations, the task of requisitioning materials, supplies, equipment parts, or repair services falls under E0 as it does not clearly benefit from the use of the LLM to reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete the task.
