1: In this task, the Food Science Technicians are responsible for training newly hired laboratory personnel. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality. 

Food Science Technicians training newly hired laboratory personnel involves a hands-on approach, demonstrating techniques, explaining procedures, and providing guidance in a laboratory setting. This task requires human interaction, practical demonstrations, and real-time feedback, which cannot be effectively replaced by the LLM alone. While the LLM could potentially assist in creating training materials or providing theoretical knowledge, the core aspect of hands-on training and interaction is crucial in this task.
