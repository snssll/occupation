1: In this task, the Marine Engineers and Naval Architects are required to prepare technical reports for various stakeholders. To complete this task, they need to gather data, analyze it, and present it in a clear and concise manner. With access to the powerful OpenAI large language model (LLM), the engineers and architects can significantly reduce the time it takes to draft these technical reports. The LLM can assist in generating technical content, providing insights, and ensuring the reports are well-structured and informative. This task involves writing and transforming text according to complex instructions, providing edits to existing text, and summarizing information, all of which are capabilities of the LLM. Therefore, this task falls under the E1 label as direct access to the LLM can expedite the report preparation process with equivalent quality.
