1: In this task, a Quality Control Systems Manager is responsible for creating and implementing inspection and testing criteria or procedures. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality.

- E0: This task involves creating specific criteria and procedures for inspection and testing, which may require domain-specific knowledge, understanding of regulations, and practical experience. The task does not involve writing or transforming text/code, providing edits, summarizing documents, or any other text-based activities that the LLM excels at. The task also does not involve image capabilities or specialized databases that could be enhanced by the LLM.

- E1: While the LLM could potentially assist in generating some initial ideas or providing general information related to inspection and testing criteria, the task itself requires a high level of expertise, domain-specific knowledge, and practical experience that the LLM may not fully possess. The task involves decision-making and implementation that goes beyond the capabilities of the LLM alone.

- E2: It is conceivable that additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to assist in organizing and structuring inspection and testing criteria or procedures. This software could potentially help in summarizing complex documents, retrieving specialized domain knowledge, or making recommendations based on data. However, the core task of creating and implementing these criteria still heavily relies on human expertise and experience.

- E3: The task does not involve image capabilities, so this label does not apply.

2: E0

3: High
