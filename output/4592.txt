1: In this task, a crane and tower operator needs to determine load weights and check them against lifting capacities to prevent overload. To complete this task, the operator would typically need to calculate the weight of the load being lifted and compare it to the lifting capacity of the crane or tower. This involves mathematical calculations and understanding the specifications of the equipment being used.

When considering the exposure rubric, the task of determining load weights and checking them against lifting capacities does not directly involve text input or output that can be easily processed by an LLM. The task is more focused on practical calculations and equipment specifications rather than textual information processing. Therefore, the task does not fall under E1, E2, or E3 categories.
