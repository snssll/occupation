1: In this task, a special education teacher at the middle school level is required to confer with various stakeholders to develop individual educational plans (IEPs) for students. To complete this task, the teacher needs to gather information, analyze student needs, collaborate with different professionals, and create tailored plans to support students' educational, physical, and social development.

Considering the task requirements, the most relevant exposure label from the rubric would be E0. This task involves a high degree of human interaction, collaboration, and decision-making based on nuanced information about individual students. While an LLM could potentially assist in providing general information or guidelines related to IEPs, the core of this task involves personalized interactions and decision-making that require human expertise, empathy, and understanding of the specific needs of each student. Therefore, the task is not easily reducible to text-based interactions or automated processes that an LLM could provide.

2: E0
