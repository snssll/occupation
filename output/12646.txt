1: In this task, a transportation planner is required to prepare or review engineering studies or specifications. To complete this task, the transportation planner needs to have a deep understanding of transportation systems, engineering principles, and regulations. The task involves analyzing data, making recommendations, and ensuring that the engineering studies or specifications meet the required standards.

Considering the task description, the most relevant exposure label from the rubric would be E2 - Exposure by LLM-powered applications. While the LLM can assist in providing information and generating text related to transportation planning, it may not significantly reduce the time it takes to prepare or review engineering studies or specifications. However, it is easy to imagine additional software built on top of the LLM that could streamline the process by summarizing technical documents, retrieving specialized domain knowledge, and making recommendations based on data.
