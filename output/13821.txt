1: In this task, a Quality Control Analyst is responsible for receiving and inspecting raw materials. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if direct access to the LLM could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality. 

- E0: This task involves physical interaction with raw materials, which cannot be replaced by the LLM. The LLM cannot physically receive or inspect raw materials, so it cannot directly assist in this task.
- E1: The LLM could potentially assist in documenting the inspection process, generating reports, or providing guidelines for inspection criteria. However, the core task of physically receiving and inspecting raw materials cannot be directly performed by the LLM.
- E2: While the LLM could potentially be used to develop software tools for organizing inspection data, creating checklists, or analyzing trends in material quality, the direct impact on reducing the time to physically receive and inspect raw materials may not be significant.
- E3: The task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images, so the image capabilities of the LLM are not relevant here.

Based on the above analysis, the most appropriate label for this task is E0.

2: E0

3: High
