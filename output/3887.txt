1: In this task, the tellers are responsible for counting, verifying, and posting armored car deposits. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves a series of manual steps such as counting physical cash, verifying the amount, and recording the deposit. These actions require physical interaction with the deposits and may involve handling sensitive financial information. While an LLM could potentially assist in providing guidelines or information related to deposit verification procedures, the core of the task involves physical actions that cannot be directly performed by the LLM. Therefore, the task does not align with the capabilities of the LLM to significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task.
