1: In this task, a Continuous Mining Machine Operator is required to check the stability of roof and rib support systems before mining face areas. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be significantly aided by text-based information processing or analysis. 

- The task involves assessing the stability of support systems, which requires physical inspection and evaluation of the mining site. This task does not involve text-based information processing or analysis that can be directly assisted by an LLM.
- The task is hands-on and requires on-site presence and physical assessment, which cannot be replaced by text-based information processing alone.
- While an LLM could potentially provide information on best practices for roof and rib support systems, the actual assessment of stability before mining face areas is a practical, physical task that cannot be directly assisted by an LLM.
