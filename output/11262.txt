1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of participating in the development or implementation of online marketing strategy as a Search Marketing Strategist, we need to consider the level of exposure to LLM.

- E1: Direct exposure - If the task involves writing and transforming text related to online marketing strategies, providing edits to marketing content, generating questions for marketing research, or maintaining records of marketing data, then direct access to the LLM could significantly reduce the time needed to complete these tasks with equivalent quality. The LLM could assist in generating marketing copy, analyzing data for strategy development, or even drafting email communications related to marketing campaigns.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While having access to the LLM alone may not reduce the time to complete the task by half, additional software built on top of the LLM could enhance the capabilities for a Search Marketing Strategist. This software could summarize large volumes of marketing data, retrieve up-to-date market trends, provide recommendations based on data analysis, or even offer counsel on marketing strategies.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities would not significantly impact the task of participating in the development or implementation of online marketing strategy for a Search Marketing Strategist. This task primarily involves text-based activities related to marketing planning and execution, which can be effectively handled by the LLM without the need for image processing.
