1: In this task, the helper-electrician is required to operate cutting torches and welding equipment to work with conduit and metal components for constructing electrical devices. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the complexity of the task and the potential for the LLM to assist in completing it. 

- The task involves hands-on work with physical tools and materials, such as cutting torches and welding equipment, which cannot be directly assisted by the LLM.
- The task requires practical skills and knowledge related to electrical work, which may not be effectively substituted by the LLM alone.
- The task involves physical construction work that cannot be simulated or completed virtually by the LLM.

Based on these considerations, it is clear that the task of operating cutting torches and welding equipment as a helper-electrician falls under the E0 label as it involves physical, hands-on work that cannot be significantly assisted by the LLM.
