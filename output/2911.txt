1: In this task, the Arbitrators, Mediators, and Conciliators are required to conduct hearings to obtain information or evidence relative to the disposition of claims. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves conducting hearings, which typically involves listening to testimonies, analyzing evidence, and making decisions based on the information presented. While an LLM could potentially assist in generating questions, summarizing information, or providing background research, the core aspect of conducting hearings involves human interaction, active listening, and decision-making based on nuanced information and context. The LLM may not be able to fully replace the role of an Arbitrator, Mediator, or Conciliator in this task, as it requires a high degree of human judgment, empathy, and understanding of complex interpersonal dynamics.
