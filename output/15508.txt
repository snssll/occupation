1: In this task, a lawyer is required to perform various activities during a trial, such as selecting jurors, arguing motions, meeting with judges, and questioning witnesses. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes for a lawyer to complete these tasks with high quality. 

- Selecting jurors: The LLM could potentially assist in providing insights into juror behavior or preferences based on text input, but the final selection process involves human judgment and legal expertise that the LLM may not fully capture.
- Arguing motions: The LLM can help generate arguments, analyze legal precedents, and provide legal information, but the actual presentation and persuasion in court require human skills and experience.
- Meeting with judges: The LLM can provide legal research and drafting support for briefs or memos, but the interaction with judges involves nuances, legal strategy, and negotiation that are best handled by a human lawyer.
- Questioning witnesses: While the LLM can help generate questions based on legal knowledge, the dynamic nature of witness examination, including follow-up questions and reading body language, requires human intervention.

Considering the complexity, legal expertise, and human interaction involved in these tasks, it is unlikely that the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes for a lawyer to complete them with high quality. Therefore, this task falls under E0.
