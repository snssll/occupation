1: Geoscientists, except hydrologists and geographers, are professionals who study the Earth's composition, structure, and processes. One of their tasks involves designing geological mine maps, monitoring mine structural integrity, or advising and monitoring mining crews. To determine the appropriate label for this task's exposure to LLM, we need to consider the complexity and specificity of the knowledge and skills required for this task. Designing geological mine maps and monitoring mine structural integrity involve specialized geological knowledge, understanding of mining processes, and expertise in geology and engineering. Advising and monitoring mining crews also require practical experience and interpersonal skills. While an LLM could potentially assist in providing general information on geological concepts, it may not have the specialized domain knowledge required for tasks specific to mining operations. Therefore, the task falls under E0 as it involves highly specialized domain knowledge and practical skills beyond the capabilities of the LLM.
