1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of reviewing existing electrical engineering criteria, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves analyzing technical documents, identifying outdated material, and suggesting revisions. The LLM can assist in this task by summarizing the existing criteria, providing insights on current industry standards, and generating suggestions for revisions based on the input data. The LLM can also help in researching up-to-date information related to electrical engineering practices. While the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task by providing relevant information and suggestions, it may not be able to directly access and analyze the specific criteria documents without manual input.
