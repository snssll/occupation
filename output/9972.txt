1: In this task, an Information Security Analyst is required to monitor current reports of computer viruses to decide when to update virus protection systems. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be significantly expedited or improved by using the language model. 

- E0: This task involves monitoring reports of computer viruses, which may require accessing real-time data, analyzing technical information, and making critical decisions based on the latest information. While the LLM can provide general information about viruses and security measures, it may not have access to real-time data or the ability to accurately predict when virus protection systems need updating based on current reports. Therefore, the task does not seem to benefit significantly from LLM assistance.

- E1: The LLM could potentially assist in summarizing recent reports on computer viruses, providing insights into emerging threats, or suggesting best practices for updating virus protection systems. However, the task of monitoring current reports and making timely decisions based on the latest information may still heavily rely on real-time data and specialized knowledge that the LLM alone may not possess.

- E2: While the LLM could be used to gather and summarize information on computer viruses, additional software could be developed to automate the monitoring process, analyze trends in virus reports, and provide real-time alerts for updating virus protection systems. This software could enhance the analyst's efficiency in staying abreast of the latest threats and taking proactive measures.

- E3: The task does not involve image processing or detailed visual analysis, so exposure to image capabilities would not significantly impact the completion of this task.
