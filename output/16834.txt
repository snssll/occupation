1: Special Education Teachers, whether in middle school or secondary school, have the task of teaching socially acceptable behavior using techniques like behavior modification and positive reinforcement. To determine the appropriate exposure label for this task in relation to the LLM, we need to consider the nature of the task. This task involves a significant amount of human interaction, observation, and personalized instruction tailored to individual students' needs. It requires real-time assessment of behavior, understanding of social dynamics, and empathy in addressing behavioral challenges. While the LLM could potentially provide general information on behavior modification techniques and positive reinforcement strategies, the core of this task lies in the practical application of these techniques in a classroom setting, which involves complex human interactions and nuanced decision-making that cannot be fully replicated by an AI model. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it requires a high degree of human interaction and personalized instruction that cannot be effectively replaced by the LLM.
