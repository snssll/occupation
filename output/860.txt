1: In this task, the Arbitrators, Mediators, and Conciliators need to apply relevant laws, regulations, policies, or precedents to reach conclusions. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality. The LLM can provide information on laws, regulations, and policies, but it may not have the ability to interpret them in a nuanced way or consider the specific context of a dispute. While the LLM can provide general information, the task of applying these to reach conclusions requires human judgment, understanding of the specific case, and consideration of various factors beyond what the LLM can provide. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it involves decision-making based on complex legal knowledge and context-specific considerations that the LLM alone cannot handle.
