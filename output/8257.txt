1: In this task, a Home Appliance Repairer is required to instruct customers on how to operate and care for their appliances, as well as provide important information like emergency service numbers. To complete this task, the repairer needs to communicate effectively, provide clear instructions, and ensure that customers understand how to use and maintain their appliances. With the help of a large language model (LLM), the repairer could potentially generate scripts or templates for common instructions, create personalized care guides for different appliances, and even provide emergency service numbers based on the customer's location. The LLM could assist in drafting clear and concise communication materials, making it easier for the repairer to convey information to customers.

Considering the nature of the task and the potential for the LLM to assist in generating written communication, providing information, and creating instructional materials, I would classify this task as E1 - Direct exposure.

2: E1
