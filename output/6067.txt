1: In this task, a radiation therapist is required to educate, prepare, and reassure patients and their families by answering questions, providing physical assistance, and reinforcing physicians' advice regarding treatment reactions or post-treatment care. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves a high degree of human interaction, empathy, and physical assistance, which cannot be effectively replaced by an LLM. The task also requires emotional intelligence, understanding non-verbal cues, and providing personalized care, which are beyond the capabilities of the LLM. Therefore, the task falls under E0 as it cannot be significantly expedited or improved by the use of an LLM.

2: E0
