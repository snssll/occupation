1: In this task, the teller needs to order a supply of cash to meet daily needs. This task involves a straightforward process of determining the amount of cash required based on daily transactions and ensuring that the cash supply is sufficient. The task does not involve complex decision-making or specialized knowledge beyond basic financial calculations. 

Considering the task requirements, the LLM could potentially assist by providing templates or guidelines on how to calculate the appropriate amount of cash needed based on historical data or average daily transactions. The LLM could also help in generating reports or summaries related to cash flow to aid in decision-making. However, the task does not require any advanced capabilities beyond basic text input and output, and the assistance provided by the LLM would not significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete the task.
