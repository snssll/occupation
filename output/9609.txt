1: In this task, a glazier is required to measure and mark outlines or patterns on glass to indicate cutting lines. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone or with additional software could significantly reduce the time it takes for a glazier to complete this task with high quality.

- E0: This task involves precise measurements and physical work that cannot be replaced by text-based tools like the LLM. The LLM does not have the capability to physically measure or mark glass, so it cannot directly assist in this task.

- E1: The LLM could potentially provide information on best practices for measuring and marking glass, but it cannot physically perform these actions. While it could offer some guidance or instructions, the core task of measuring and marking glass would still need to be done manually by the glazier.

- E2: It is conceivable that additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to provide virtual simulations or augmented reality tools that assist glaziers in measuring and marking glass more efficiently. Such software could potentially analyze patterns and provide cutting line suggestions based on input. However, this would require specialized image recognition capabilities and real-time interaction, which are not currently within the LLM's capabilities.

- E3: The task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images, so the image capabilities of the LLM are not directly relevant here.
