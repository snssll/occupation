1: In this task, the Highway Maintenance Worker needs to set out signs and cones around work areas to divert traffic. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone or with additional software could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality.

- **E0**: This task involves physical work that cannot be automated by the LLM or any software tool. It requires manual labor to physically place signs and cones, which cannot be done through text input or output.

- **E1**: The LLM could potentially provide guidance on the best practices for setting out signs and cones, safety protocols, or even draft text for the signs. However, the physical aspect of placing the signs and cones cannot be automated, so the time savings would not be significant enough to warrant an E1 label.

- **E2**: While the LLM could potentially provide information on traffic diversion strategies or safety guidelines, the task itself is heavily reliant on physical actions that cannot be automated by the LLM alone. Developing additional software on top of the LLM to automate this task would be challenging due to the physical nature of the work.

- **E3**: The task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images, so the image capabilities of the LLM would not significantly impact the completion time of this task.

Based on the above analysis, the most appropriate label for this task is **E0**.

2: E0

3: High
