1: In this task, a Food Preparation Worker is required to use manual or electric appliances to clean, peel, slice, and trim foods. This task involves physical actions such as cleaning, peeling, slicing, and trimming food items using appliances. Since this task is hands-on and involves physical manipulation of food items, it does not directly align with the capabilities of the LLM. The LLM cannot perform physical tasks or interact with physical objects. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not benefit from the use of the LLM or any LLM-powered tools.
