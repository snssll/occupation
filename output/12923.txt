1: In this task, an orthopedic surgeon is required to prescribe preoperative and postoperative treatments and procedures for patients undergoing orthopedic surgeries. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves medical decision-making based on the patient's condition, medical history, and the specific surgical procedure. This task requires specialized medical knowledge, expertise, and the ability to assess individual patient needs, which are not solely text-based and cannot be fully captured within the 2000-word context limit of the LLM. While the LLM can provide general information on orthopedic surgeries, it cannot replace the expertise and judgment of a qualified orthopedic surgeon in prescribing specific treatments and procedures tailored to each patient.
