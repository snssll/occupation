1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of script, planning, and creating animated narrative sequences under tight deadlines for Special Effects Artists and Animators, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM in assisting with this task. The LLM can help in generating scripts, providing creative ideas for narratives, and potentially even assisting in planning sequences. It can also offer suggestions for visual effects and animation techniques. However, the LLM may not have the specialized knowledge of industry-standard computer software and hand drawing techniques required for this task. While it can provide general guidance and ideas, the detailed execution of the animation may still heavily rely on the animator's expertise and experience. Therefore, the task may not be significantly reduced in time by using the LLM alone, as it requires a combination of artistic skills and technical knowledge that the LLM may not fully possess.
