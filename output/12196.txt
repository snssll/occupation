1: In this task, a Roof Bolter in mining is responsible for positioning safety jacks to support underground mine roofs until bolts can be installed. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone or with additional software could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality.

Given the nature of the task, which involves physical work in a hazardous environment, it is unlikely that the LLM or any software built on top of it could assist in completing the task. The task requires hands-on work, precise measurements, and a deep understanding of mining safety protocols, which cannot be effectively replaced by text-based AI models. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM or any software that could be developed on top of it.

2: E0

3: High
