1: In this task, a Library Assistant, Clerical is responsible for opening and closing the library during specified hours and securing library equipment. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes for a worker to complete this task with high quality.

- The task involves physical actions such as opening and closing the library and securing equipment, which cannot be directly performed by the LLM.
- The task does not involve complex text transformation, writing, summarization, or data analysis that the LLM could assist with.
- The task does not require specialized domain knowledge or up-to-date facts that the LLM could provide.
- There is no need for image capabilities to complete this task.

Based on these considerations, it is clear that the LLM cannot directly assist in completing this task, and there are no additional software applications that could be developed on top of the LLM to reduce the time significantly. Therefore, this task falls under E0.

2: E0

3: High
