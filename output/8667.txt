1: In this task, the Amusement and Recreation Attendants are required to keep informed of shut-down and emergency evacuation procedures. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves staying updated on specific procedures related to safety and emergency protocols within an amusement or recreation setting. This task does not involve complex data analysis, specialized domain knowledge, or detailed image processing. The task primarily requires understanding and memorizing information related to safety procedures.

Given that the task involves text-based information that can be easily processed by the LLM, it falls under the category of E1 - Direct exposure. The LLM can assist in summarizing, organizing, and presenting the shut-down and emergency evacuation procedures in a clear and concise manner, thereby reducing the time it takes for an attendant to stay informed.
