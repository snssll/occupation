1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of recommending new equipment or software packages as a Computer Systems Analyst, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM can assist in completing it. 

- Computer Systems Analysts typically evaluate the current systems in place, identify areas for improvement, and recommend new equipment or software packages to enhance efficiency and productivity.
- The LLM can assist in this task by providing information on the latest technology trends, reviews of different equipment or software packages, and potential benefits and drawbacks of each option.
- The LLM can also help in analyzing data related to system performance and compatibility with existing infrastructure to make informed recommendations.

Based on the above considerations, this task falls under E2 - Exposure by LLM-powered applications. While direct access to the LLM can provide information and insights to aid in recommending new equipment or software packages, additional software tools could be developed to further streamline the process and provide more specialized recommendations based on specific organizational needs.
