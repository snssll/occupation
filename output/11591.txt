1: For the task of performing other clerical duties as a Word Processor and Typist, such as answering telephones, sorting mail, running errands, or sending faxes, the exposure to LLM can be analyzed as follows:

- **E0**: This task involves physical actions like running errands, which cannot be automated by the LLM or any software tool. Additionally, tasks like answering telephones may require human interaction that cannot be replaced by the LLM.

- **E1**: While the LLM can assist in generating written responses for faxes or emails, providing templates for mail sorting, or drafting messages for telephone responses, the physical aspects of running errands or the need for real-time telephone interactions may limit the extent to which the LLM can significantly reduce the time to complete the task.

- **E2**: With additional software development, it is conceivable that an application could be created to automate certain aspects of clerical duties, such as organizing mail, managing faxes, or generating responses based on predefined templates. However, the physical tasks like running errands would still require human intervention.

- **E3**: Image capabilities would not significantly impact the completion of this task as it primarily involves text-based and physical actions rather than image processing.
