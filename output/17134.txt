1: In this task of training horses or other equines, the primary focus is on utilizing knowledge of breed characteristics, training methods, performance standards, and understanding the peculiarities of each animal. While an LLM could potentially provide information on breed characteristics, training methods, and performance standards, the crucial aspect of training animals based on their individual peculiarities requires hands-on experience and observation, which cannot be effectively replaced by text-based information alone. The task involves physical interaction with animals, assessing their behavior, and adapting training techniques accordingly, which are not tasks that an LLM can assist with directly. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not significantly benefit from LLM capabilities.
