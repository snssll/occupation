1: In this task, a psychiatrist is required to review and evaluate treatment procedures and outcomes of other psychiatrists or medical professionals. To complete this task, the psychiatrist would need to analyze written reports, treatment plans, and patient outcomes. The LLM could assist by summarizing lengthy documents, providing insights based on existing knowledge, and potentially even suggesting alternative treatment approaches based on the information provided. The LLM could also help in generating questions or feedback based on the reviewed materials. However, since this task involves a high level of expertise in psychiatry and requires nuanced understanding of treatment procedures and outcomes, the LLM alone may not be able to fully replace the expertise of a psychiatrist in evaluating these aspects accurately. Therefore, this task falls under E2 as having access to additional software that could be developed on top of the LLM might further enhance the efficiency of completing the task.
