1: In this task, a janitor or cleaner is required to remove snow from sidewalks, driveways, or parking areas using various tools like snowplows, snow blowers, snow shovels, or snow-melting chemicals. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality. 

- E0: This task involves physical labor and manual work that cannot be automated by the LLM. The task requires direct interaction with the environment, such as operating snow removal equipment and spreading chemicals, which cannot be performed by the LLM.
- E1: The task does not involve writing, transforming text, or providing edits to existing text. It is a hands-on task that requires physical effort and specific skills related to snow removal. The LLM cannot directly assist in completing this task.
- E2: While it is conceivable that software could be developed to provide guidance or recommendations on the most efficient snow removal techniques based on general knowledge, the task itself is primarily physical and practical in nature. The LLM alone would not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task.
- E3: The task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images. The use of image capabilities would not be relevant in this context.
