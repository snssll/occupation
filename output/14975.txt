1: In this task, a Financial Examiner is required to review audit reports of internal and external auditors to monitor the adequacy of the scope of reports or to discover specific weaknesses in internal routines. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could assist in completing it. 

- E0: This task involves reviewing detailed audit reports, which may require a high level of expertise and understanding of financial regulations and practices. The task also involves analyzing complex information and making critical judgments based on the findings. The LLM may not significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced Financial Examiner to complete this task with high quality, as it requires specialized knowledge and expertise beyond what the LLM can provide.

- E1: The LLM could potentially assist in summarizing key points from the audit reports, providing additional insights or explanations based on the text, or generating questions for further investigation. However, the task of reviewing audit reports and monitoring the adequacy of reports or identifying weaknesses may still heavily rely on the expertise and experience of the Financial Examiner, making it unlikely that the LLM alone could reduce the time to complete the task by at least half with equivalent quality.

- E2: While the LLM could be used to summarize audit reports or provide additional context, developing specialized software on top of the LLM that can analyze financial data, identify specific weaknesses in internal routines, or make recommendations based on the audit findings could potentially reduce the time it takes to complete the task. This additional software could leverage the LLM's capabilities to process and analyze financial information more efficiently.

- E3: The task does not involve image processing or creation, so the image capabilities of the LLM are not relevant in this context.
