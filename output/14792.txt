1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of researching or reviewing regulatory, technical, or market issues related to sustainability as a Sustainability Specialist, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves gathering information, analyzing regulations, technical aspects, and market trends in the field of sustainability. The LLM can assist in providing information on these topics, summarizing documents, answering questions, and potentially even making recommendations based on the data provided. The LLM can also help in preparing training materials based on general knowledge related to sustainability. However, the task may require accessing up-to-date information, which the LLM alone may not be able to provide without the information being explicitly stated in the input.
