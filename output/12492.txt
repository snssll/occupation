1: For the task of preparing documents and correspondence as a Correspondence Clerk, the exposure to LLM can be evaluated as follows:

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** The task involves writing and transforming text according to specific instructions, which can be efficiently handled by the LLM. The model can assist in drafting various types of correspondence, such as damage claims, credit inquiries, invoices, and service complaints, based on the provided guidelines. The LLM can generate text, make edits, and ensure the content meets the required standards.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the task can benefit from the LLM's text generation capabilities, additional software could be developed to streamline the process further. For instance, an application could be designed to extract relevant information from databases or systems to automatically populate the correspondence templates, saving time and effort for the Correspondence Clerk.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Image capabilities are not directly relevant to the task of preparing documents and correspondence, as it primarily involves text-based content creation. Therefore, this task does not align with the benefits provided by image capabilities.

Based on the above analysis, the task of preparing documents and correspondence as a Correspondence Clerk aligns most closely with **E1 (Direct exposure)** to the LLM.
