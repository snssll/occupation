1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of reviewing development plans to determine potential traffic impact as a Transportation Engineer, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be aided by the use of the OpenAI large language model (LLM).

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** The task involves analyzing text-based development plans to assess their impact on traffic. The LLM can assist in this process by providing relevant information on traffic engineering principles, regulations, and best practices. It can help in summarizing key points from the plans, identifying potential traffic issues, and suggesting solutions based on existing knowledge within the 2000-word context limit.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the LLM alone can provide valuable insights and recommendations based on the input text, additional software could be developed to enhance the efficiency of analyzing and extracting key information from complex development plans. This software could potentially summarize lengthy documents, retrieve up-to-date traffic data, and provide more specialized domain knowledge to aid in decision-making.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Since the task primarily involves reviewing text-based development plans, there is no direct need for image capabilities in this scenario. The task does not require analyzing images or creating/editing digital images, so the image capabilities provided by the LLM are not essential for completing this task.
