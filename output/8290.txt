1: In this task, a dental assistant is required to instruct patients in oral hygiene and plaque control programs. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes for a dental assistant to complete this task with equivalent quality. The task involves providing instructions to patients, which requires interpersonal skills, demonstration, and potentially hands-on guidance. While the LLM can provide information on oral hygiene and plaque control, it cannot physically interact with patients or demonstrate techniques. Therefore, the task cannot be completed solely through text-based instructions from the LLM. As a result, the task falls under E0 as it does not meet the criteria for exposure to LLM.
