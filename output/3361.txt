1: In this task, a curator is required to confer with the board of directors to formulate and interpret policies, determine budget requirements, and plan overall operations. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves complex decision-making, strategic planning, and policy formulation, which are not easily reducible to text input and output. While an LLM could potentially assist in drafting policy documents or providing background information, the core aspects of decision-making and strategic planning involve human judgment, context, and expertise that go beyond text-based interactions. Therefore, the task does not seem to fit into the categories where LLM exposure would significantly reduce the time to complete the task.
