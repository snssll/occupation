1: In this task, a sheet metal worker shapes metal material using hand tools. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if access to the LLM or LLM-powered tools can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete the task with high quality by at least half.

- The task of shaping metal material over anvils, blocks, or other forms using hand tools is a physical, hands-on task that requires manual dexterity and skill. It involves working with physical materials and tools in a workshop setting.
- The LLM and LLM-powered tools are primarily focused on text-based tasks, such as generating text, providing information, or analyzing written content. They do not have the capability to physically shape metal or interact with physical objects.
- While the LLM could potentially provide information on techniques, safety guidelines, or best practices related to sheet metal work, it cannot directly assist in the physical act of shaping metal material using hand tools.
- Given the nature of the task as a hands-on, physical activity that cannot be replicated or assisted by text-based AI tools, it is unlikely that access to the LLM would significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task for an experienced sheet metal worker.

Based on these considerations, the task of shaping metal material over anvils, blocks, or other forms using hand tools would be classified as E0 - No exposure.
