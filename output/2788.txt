1: In this task, the accountant or auditor is required to compute taxes owed and prepare tax returns while ensuring compliance with payment, reporting, or other tax requirements. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM can assist in completing it. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM can assist in providing guidance on tax laws, regulations, and calculations. It can help in generating accurate tax returns based on the information provided. The LLM can also assist in ensuring compliance with tax requirements by providing up-to-date information on tax laws and regulations. Overall, the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to compute taxes owed and prepare tax returns with equivalent quality by at least half.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone can provide substantial assistance in completing the task, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to further streamline the process. This software could include features like summarizing complex tax laws, retrieving up-to-date tax information, and analyzing specific tax scenarios to provide recommendations. Such software could enhance the efficiency of tax computation and return preparation.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not relevant to the task of computing taxes owed and preparing tax returns. This task primarily involves working with text-based information related to tax laws, regulations, and financial data.

Based on the above analysis, the most appropriate exposure label for this task is E1: Direct exposure.

2: E1

3: High
