1: For the task of investigating crimes within an institution or assisting police in their investigations, an LLM could potentially assist by providing information on standard procedures for conducting investigations, legal guidelines for handling evidence, and general advice on interacting with inmates and law enforcement. The LLM could also help in generating reports based on the information gathered during the investigation. However, since this task involves practical, hands-on work such as gathering physical evidence, interviewing witnesses, and collaborating with law enforcement, the LLM's capabilities may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with high quality. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it requires a high degree of human interaction and practical skills that cannot be fully replaced by the LLM.
