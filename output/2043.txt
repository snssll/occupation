1: For the task of cleaning machines and machine parts as a Maintenance Worker, Machinery, the exposure to LLM can be evaluated as follows:

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** The task of cleaning machines and machine parts involves following a set of instructions and procedures to ensure proper maintenance. An LLM could potentially assist in providing detailed step-by-step instructions on how to clean specific types of machines or parts, recommend suitable cleaning solvents, or suggest efficient cleaning techniques. The LLM could also help in generating safety guidelines or troubleshooting tips related to cleaning machinery. Overall, the LLM could significantly reduce the time it takes to gather relevant information and instructions for cleaning tasks, improving efficiency and accuracy.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the task of cleaning machines and machine parts may not require highly specialized domain knowledge that an LLM-powered application could provide, there is potential for software to be developed on top of the LLM that could streamline the process further. For example, an application could be designed to generate customized cleaning schedules based on machine types, maintenance history, and environmental factors. This application could also integrate real-time data on machine conditions to recommend specific cleaning techniques or products. Such software could enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of maintenance tasks.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Image capabilities would not significantly impact the task of cleaning machines and machine parts, as it primarily involves manual cleaning processes rather than visual analysis or image editing. Therefore, the use of image capabilities would not provide a substantial reduction in time for completing this task.
