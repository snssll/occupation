1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of designing, evaluating, recommending, and approving changes to forms and reports as a Management Analyst, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be supported by the capabilities of the LLM.

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** The task involves working with text-based documents (forms and reports) and making recommendations based on the content. An LLM could assist in generating new form/report templates, providing insights on best practices, or even suggesting improvements based on the input data. The LLM can help in transforming text and providing recommendations, which aligns with the capabilities of an LLM for text-based tasks.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the task could potentially benefit from additional software that could summarize lengthy reports, retrieve up-to-date information for analysis, or provide specialized domain knowledge, the core task of designing, evaluating, recommending, and approving changes to forms and reports may not require such advanced capabilities beyond what the LLM can offer on its own.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Since the task primarily involves working with text-based documents (forms and reports) and does not require detailed image analysis or creation, the image capabilities of the LLM are not directly relevant in this context.
