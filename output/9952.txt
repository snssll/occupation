1: In this task, a cashier is required to monitor checkout stations to ensure they have enough cash and are adequately staffed. With the help of a large language model (LLM), the cashier could potentially automate some aspects of this task. The LLM could assist in generating reports on cash availability at different stations based on input data, analyzing staffing schedules to recommend adjustments, and even providing insights on optimizing checkout operations. The LLM could also help in communicating with other staff members or managers regarding any issues or recommendations for improvement. Overall, the LLM could significantly reduce the time and effort required to monitor and manage checkout stations effectively.

Considering the capabilities of the LLM in providing text-based assistance, generating reports, analyzing data, and offering recommendations, this task falls under E1 - Direct exposure.
