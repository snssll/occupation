1: In this task, the worker is required to produce a rough concrete surface using a broom. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if access to the LLM or LLM-powered tools can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality.

- The task of producing a rough concrete surface using a broom is a physical task that involves manual labor and skill in working with concrete. It does not involve text input or output that can be processed by the LLM.
- The LLM does not have the capability to physically manipulate concrete or use a broom to produce a rough surface.
- There are no text-based instructions or information related to this task that the LLM can assist with.
- The task does not involve complex data analysis, decision-making, or information retrieval that the LLM could help with.

Based on these considerations, it is clear that the task of producing a rough concrete surface using a broom does not fall within the scope of tasks that can be assisted by the LLM or LLM-powered tools. Therefore, this task is best classified as E0 - No exposure.
