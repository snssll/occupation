1: In this task, the occupation of Roof Bolters, Mining involves installing various types of bolts across entire ceiling spans. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality. 

Given the nature of the task, which involves physical labor, precise measurements, and working in a mining environment, it is unlikely that the LLM or any tool built on top of it can effectively assist in completing the task. The task requires hands-on work, knowledge of mining safety regulations, and physical capabilities that cannot be replicated by the LLM. Therefore, the task falls under E0 as it does not meet the criteria for exposure to LLM capabilities.

2: E0

3: High
