1: In this task, the worker is required to turn valves to pump sterilizing solutions or rinse water through pipes or equipment, or to spray vats with atomizers. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. This task involves physical actions such as turning valves and operating machinery, which cannot be directly performed by an LLM. The task does not involve complex decision-making, analysis of data, or writing and transforming text. Therefore, the task does not align with the capabilities of an LLM or any software that could be developed on top of it to reduce the time it takes to complete the task significantly.
