1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of defining instructional, learning, or performance objectives as an Instructional Coordinator, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be facilitated by the use of the OpenAI large language model (LLM).

- Instructional Coordinators are responsible for developing and implementing curricula and instructional materials, so defining objectives is a key aspect of their role.
- The task involves writing and transforming text to clearly articulate the goals and outcomes of educational programs.
- The LLM can assist in generating and refining the wording of objectives based on input criteria and educational standards.
- The LLM can also provide examples, explanations, and context to ensure the objectives are comprehensive and aligned with best practices in education.
- While the task does not involve complex visual elements or specialized domain knowledge that would require additional software beyond the LLM, the model's capabilities in text generation and educational content can significantly streamline the process of defining objectives.

Based on these considerations, the task of defining instructional, learning, or performance objectives for Instructional Coordinators would fall under label E1 - Direct exposure.
