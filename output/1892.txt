1: In this task, a Cardiovascular Technologist or Technician is responsible for checking, testing, and maintaining cardiology equipment, including making minor repairs when necessary. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we can break down the task:
- Checking, testing, and maintaining cardiology equipment: This involves inspecting the equipment, running tests to ensure functionality, and performing routine maintenance tasks. An LLM could potentially assist in providing information on standard procedures for equipment checks and maintenance.
- Making minor repairs when necessary: This aspect may involve troubleshooting common issues and performing basic repairs. The LLM could provide guidance on troubleshooting steps and repair techniques.

Considering the task involves a hands-on component of physically interacting with equipment and potentially performing repairs, it falls under the E0 category. While the LLM can provide information and guidance on procedures, it cannot physically interact with the equipment or perform repairs itself.

2: E0
