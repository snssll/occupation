1: In this task, a helper carpenter is required to smooth or sand surfaces to remove imperfections like ridges, tool marks, glue, or caulking. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality. Since this task involves physical labor and manual work that cannot be automated by text-based tools like the LLM, it is unlikely that the LLM or any tool built on top of it can assist in completing this task. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not meet the criteria for exposure to LLM capabilities.

2: E0

3: High
