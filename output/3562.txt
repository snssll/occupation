1: In this task, a Stationary Engineer or Boiler Operator is required to contact equipment manufacturers or specialists to resolve equipment problems. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be significantly expedited or improved by using the language model. 

- **E0**: This task involves direct human interaction and decision-making that cannot be replaced by an LLM. It requires the individual to communicate with manufacturers or specialists, which involves nuanced discussions and potentially troubleshooting steps that may not be effectively handled by an LLM.

- **E1**: While the LLM could potentially assist in drafting initial communication or summarizing information, the core aspect of this task involves real-time problem-solving and decision-making that is best handled by a human. The LLM may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality.

- **E2**: It is conceivable that an application could be developed to streamline the process of contacting equipment manufacturers or specialists by providing templates for communication or suggesting troubleshooting steps based on common issues. However, the complexity of equipment problems and the need for specialized knowledge may limit the effectiveness of such an application.

- **E3**: The task does not involve image capabilities, so this exposure level does not apply.
