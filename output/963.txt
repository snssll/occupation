1: In this task, a Set and Exhibit Designer is responsible for coordinating with outside contractors to build exhibit structures. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we can break down the task:
- Coordinating with contractors involves communication, negotiation, and planning. An LLM could potentially assist in drafting emails, summarizing contractor proposals, or generating questions to ask contractors.
- The task does not involve highly specialized domain knowledge or complex databases, so it may not benefit significantly from additional software beyond the LLM.
- The task does not require image capabilities for completion.

Considering these points, the task of arranging for outside contractors to construct exhibit structures could benefit from the LLM's assistance in communication and planning aspects, potentially reducing the time needed to complete the task with equivalent quality. Therefore, this task falls under label E1.

2: E1

3: Moderate
