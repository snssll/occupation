1: In this task, a surveyor is required to plan and conduct ground surveys to establish baselines, elevations, and other geodetic measurements. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. Surveying involves physical work on the ground, using specialized equipment to measure and map out the land accurately. This task requires precise measurements and physical presence on-site, which cannot be replaced by text-based interactions with an LLM. The task involves practical skills, knowledge of equipment operation, and understanding of geodetic principles, which are not within the capabilities of an LLM. Therefore, the task does not align with any of the exposure levels in the rubric.
