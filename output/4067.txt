1: In this task, a Tile and Stone Setter is required to cut and shape tiles to fit around obstacles and into odd spaces and corners using hand and power cutting tools. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone or with additional software could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality.

- E0: This task involves physical work that requires manual dexterity and precision in cutting and shaping tiles. The task cannot be completed solely through text input and output, as it involves hands-on work with tools. Therefore, the LLM or any software built on top of it cannot reduce the time it takes to complete this task significantly.

- E1: The task of cutting and shaping tiles is highly practical and involves physical manipulation of materials. While the LLM could potentially provide some guidance or instructions on techniques, it cannot directly perform the task itself. Therefore, the LLM alone would not reduce the time significantly to complete this task.

- E2: It is conceivable that specialized software could be developed on top of the LLM that could provide detailed instructions, tips, or best practices for cutting and shaping tiles. This software could potentially include virtual simulations or augmented reality tools to assist Tile and Stone Setters in their work. However, such software would need to be highly specialized and tailored to the specific requirements of the task.

- E3: The task of cutting and shaping tiles does not involve image processing or analysis that would benefit from image capabilities. Therefore, access to image capabilities would not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task.

2: E0

3: Certainty level: High
