1: In this task, the instructor is required to prepare students for further education by encouraging them to explore learning opportunities and persevere with challenging tasks. To complete this task, the instructor needs to provide guidance, motivation, and support to students, helping them develop a growth mindset and resilience. The task involves a significant amount of human interaction, emotional intelligence, and personalized support tailored to each student's needs. While an LLM could potentially provide some general advice or motivational content, it lacks the ability to engage in the nuanced, empathetic, and interactive way that a human instructor can. The task also involves understanding and responding to the emotional and psychological needs of students, which is beyond the capabilities of current AI models. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it requires a high degree of human interaction and emotional intelligence that cannot be effectively replicated by an LLM.
