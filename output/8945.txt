1: In this task, a Rock Splitter in a quarry is required to locate grain line patterns in rocks to determine how they will split when cut. To complete this task, the worker needs to have a good understanding of geology and rock structures. The task involves visual inspection and analysis of the rocks to identify the grain lines accurately. Since this task is primarily based on visual observation and interpretation, it does not involve text input or output that can be directly processed by an LLM. The LLM does not have the capability to view or analyze images to identify grain line patterns in rocks. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as the LLM alone cannot reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete the task.
