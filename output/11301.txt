1: In this task, a Fishing and Hunting Worker is required to patrol trap lines or nets to inspect settings, remove catch, and reset or relocate traps. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves physical activities such as patrolling trap lines, inspecting settings, and resetting traps, which cannot be directly performed by an LLM. The task also requires hands-on work and interaction with physical traps, which are not within the capabilities of the LLM. Therefore, this task falls under the category of E0 as it involves physical actions that cannot be replaced by the LLM.
