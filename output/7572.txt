1: In this task, an Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) is required to immobilize a patient for safe transport using a backboard or other spinal immobilization device. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves physical interaction with a patient, assessing their condition, and applying medical knowledge to ensure the patient's safety during transport. This task does not involve text input or output that can be easily processed by an LLM. Additionally, the task requires hands-on skills and real-time decision-making based on the patient's condition, which cannot be replicated by an LLM. Therefore, the task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM or any tools built on top of it.
