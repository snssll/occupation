1: In this task of locating and monitoring overdue accounts using computers and automated systems, the OpenAI large language model (LLM) could potentially assist by providing tools for data analysis, generating reports, and automating some aspects of the monitoring process. The LLM could help in summarizing information from multiple sources, identifying patterns in account data, and even suggesting strategies for following up on overdue accounts. While the task involves using computers and automated systems, the LLM could enhance the efficiency and accuracy of the process by handling complex data analysis and providing insights based on the information available.

Considering the nature of the task and the potential for the LLM to streamline data processing and analysis, it aligns more closely with E2 exposure. While the LLM alone may not reduce the time it takes to complete the task by half, additional software built on top of the LLM could further enhance the capabilities for monitoring overdue accounts, improving efficiency and effectiveness.
