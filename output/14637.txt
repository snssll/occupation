1: In this task, a First-Line Supervisor of Gambling Services Workers is required to report customer-related incidents occurring in gaming areas to supervisors. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM can assist in completing it. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The task involves reporting customer-related incidents, which can be effectively communicated through written text. The LLM can assist in drafting detailed incident reports based on the information provided by the supervisor. The LLM can help in summarizing the incidents, providing accurate descriptions, and ensuring that all relevant details are included in the report. This can significantly reduce the time it takes to document and report incidents accurately.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the task can benefit from the LLM's text generation capabilities, it may not require additional specialized software beyond what the LLM can already provide. The task is focused on reporting incidents, which can be effectively handled by the LLM without the need for complex summarization or analysis tools.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - The task does not involve image processing or analysis, so the image capabilities of the LLM are not relevant in this context.
