1: In this task, the occupation of Fallers involves loading logs or wood onto trucks, trailers, or railroad cars. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality. Since this task involves physical labor, such as lifting and loading heavy logs, it cannot be directly assisted by the LLM. The LLM does not have the capability to physically interact with objects or perform manual labor tasks. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not meet the criteria for exposure to the LLM.

2: E0

3: High
