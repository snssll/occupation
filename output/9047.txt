1: In this task, a Purchasing Agent is responsible for maintaining and reviewing records of purchased items, costs, deliveries, product performance, and inventories. With the help of a large language model (LLM), the agent could potentially automate the process of record-keeping by inputting data and generating reports based on the information provided. The LLM could assist in organizing and summarizing data, identifying trends, and providing insights into inventory management. This task involves a significant amount of text input and output, which the LLM is well-equipped to handle. Therefore, this task falls under E1 as the LLM can reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality by at least half.
