1: For the task of dumping materials into machine hoppers, the process is straightforward and does not involve complex decision-making or specialized knowledge. The task is physical and manual, requiring the worker to physically handle and pour materials into the hoppers. Since this task does not involve text input or output, and the context is purely physical, there is no direct way for the LLM to assist in completing this task. The LLM cannot perform physical actions or interact with machinery in the physical world. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not benefit from LLM capabilities.

2: E0
