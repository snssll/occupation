1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of attending professional meetings, educational conferences, and teacher training workshops as a Secondary School Teacher, we need to consider how the LLM can assist in this task. The LLM can help in preparing for these events by providing information on the latest trends, research, and best practices in education. It can summarize relevant documents, generate questions for discussions, and even provide feedback on presentations or materials. Additionally, the LLM can assist in writing reports or reflections on the events attended. However, the actual attendance at these events and the human interaction involved cannot be replaced by the LLM. Therefore, while the LLM can support preparation and follow-up activities, it cannot directly reduce the time spent attending these events.
