1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of rewriting original musical scores in different musical styles by changing rhythms, harmonies, or tempos, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The LLM can assist in tasks that involve writing and transforming text and code according to complex instructions. In this case, the task involves transforming musical scores, which can be considered analogous to transforming text. The LLM can generate new musical scores based on specific instructions provided, such as changing rhythms, harmonies, or tempos. Therefore, the task can be significantly aided by the LLM, reducing the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality.
