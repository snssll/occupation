1: In this task, the main responsibility is to assist students with boarding or exiting school buses. This task involves physical interaction with students and ensuring their safety during the boarding and exiting process. Since this task requires physical presence and direct interaction with students, it cannot be effectively completed using an LLM or any LLM-powered tool. The LLM does not have the capability to physically assist students or ensure their safety in real-time situations. Therefore, this task falls under the E0 category as it cannot be significantly aided by the LLM.
