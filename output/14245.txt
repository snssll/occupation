1: In this task, the clergy member is required to refer people to community support services, psychologists, or doctors. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves providing information and guidance based on the individual's needs, which can be effectively communicated through text.
- The task does not require specialized domain knowledge beyond what the LLM can provide.
- The task does not involve detailed visuals or measurements that would require image capabilities.
- The task does not involve making decisions that impact human livelihood or legal requirements.

Based on these considerations, the task of referring people to community support services, psychologists, or doctors can be effectively completed with the help of the LLM, as it involves providing information and guidance through text. Therefore, this task falls under the E1 label as the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality.
