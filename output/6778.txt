1: In this task, the coach or scout is responsible for explaining and enforcing safety rules and regulations. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality. The task involves understanding and communicating safety protocols, which may not directly benefit from the text-based capabilities of the LLM. While the LLM could potentially provide information on safety rules and regulations, the task of enforcing these rules requires physical presence and interaction, which the LLM cannot assist with. Therefore, the task does not align with the capabilities of the LLM in a way that would significantly reduce the time needed to complete it.
