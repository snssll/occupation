1: In this task, the inspector, tester, sorter, sampler, or weigher is required to compute defect percentages or averages using formulas and calculators. This task involves mathematical calculations and data analysis. With the help of the powerful OpenAI large language model (LLM), the inspector could potentially receive guidance on the specific formulas to use, explanations on how to calculate defect percentages or averages, and even assistance in understanding complex mathematical concepts related to this task. The LLM could also provide examples and step-by-step instructions on how to perform these calculations accurately. Overall, the LLM could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task by providing real-time assistance and guidance.
