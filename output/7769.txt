1: In this task, a Construction and Building Inspector is required to inspect and monitor construction sites to ensure safety standards, building codes, and specifications are being followed. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be significantly aided by the use of an LLM. An LLM could potentially assist in providing information on safety standards, building codes, and specifications, as well as offering guidance on common issues found on construction sites. However, the task itself involves physical inspection and monitoring of sites, which cannot be directly performed by an LLM. While an LLM could provide information and guidelines, the actual on-site inspection requires human presence and interaction.
