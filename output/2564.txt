1: In this task, a proofreader or copy marker is required to compare information or figures on one record against the same data on other records or with the original copy to detect errors. With the help of the LLM, the proofreader could potentially automate the comparison process by inputting the text from the records into the model and having it highlight any discrepancies or errors. The LLM could assist in identifying inconsistencies or errors in the text, making the proofreading process more efficient. This task involves text input and output, which falls within the capabilities of the LLM. Therefore, this task could be categorized as E1 as the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality by automating the comparison process.
