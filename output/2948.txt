1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of conducting logical analyses as a Computer and Information Research Scientist, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be impacted by the use of the LLM. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The task involves logical analyses and formulating mathematical models of problems. The LLM can assist in writing and transforming text and code according to complex instructions, providing edits to existing text or code, and even generating mathematical models based on the input provided. The LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task by offering suggestions, generating code snippets, or providing explanations for complex concepts related to the mathematical models.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone can assist in completing the task, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to further enhance the process. This software could include capabilities such as summarizing complex technical documents, retrieving up-to-date facts related to specific technical problems, or providing recommendations based on data analysis. These additional features could streamline the task even further.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not directly relevant to the task of conducting logical analyses and formulating mathematical models. Therefore, this task does not fall under E3.

Based on the above analysis, the task of conducting logical analyses as a Computer and Information Research Scientist aligns best with label E1: Direct exposure.
