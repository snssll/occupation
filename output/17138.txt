1: In this task, a Loss Prevention Manager is responsible for training staff on loss control and prevention measures. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task. The LLM can assist in generating training materials based on general knowledge, providing feedback on documents, and writing and transforming text according to complex instructions. It can also help in summarizing information and answering questions about documents. However, the task of training staff involves more than just written materials; it requires interactive training sessions, demonstrations, and practical exercises. While the LLM can assist in creating some training materials, it cannot fully replace the hands-on training aspect of this task. Therefore, the exposure label for this task is E0.

2: E0

3: Moderate
