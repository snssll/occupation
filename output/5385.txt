1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of directing activities of workers in the field of coroners, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be impacted by the use of the LLM. 

- Direct exposure (E1): The task involves overseeing and coordinating activities related to autopsies, pathological analyses, and record-keeping. While the LLM can provide information on medical procedures, terminology, and possibly assist in preparing documents, the task of directly managing workers conducting autopsies and analyses involves human interaction, decision-making, and practical knowledge that the LLM alone cannot replace. Therefore, the direct exposure to the LLM may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task.

- Exposure by LLM-powered applications (E2): While the LLM could potentially assist in providing information on medical procedures, terminology, and documentation, developing software on top of the LLM that could streamline record-keeping, provide recommendations based on data analysis, or offer specialized knowledge in the field of pathology could enhance the efficiency of the task. However, the direct supervision and coordination of workers conducting autopsies and analyses would still require human judgment and interaction.

- Exposure given image capabilities (E3): The task of directing activities of workers in the field of coroners does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images. Therefore, the image capabilities of the LLM would not significantly impact the completion of this task.

Based on the above analysis, the most appropriate label for this task would be E2 - Exposure by LLM-powered applications.

2: E2
