1: In this task, a First-Line Supervisor of Correctional Officers is responsible for developing work or security procedures within a correctional facility. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we can break down the task as follows:

- Writing and transforming text: The task involves creating written work or security procedures, which can be done using the LLM to draft and refine the procedures.
- Providing edits to existing text: The LLM can assist in reviewing and revising existing procedures to ensure they are up to standard.
- Informing others of information: The LLM can help in communicating the developed procedures to the relevant personnel.

Considering these points, the task can be significantly expedited and enhanced in quality by utilizing the LLM for drafting, editing, and communicating the work or security procedures.
