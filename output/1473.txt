1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of attending workshops, seminars, or professional meetings to remain informed of new developments in school psychology, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The task involves staying updated on new developments in school psychology, which may require reading and synthesizing information from various sources. The LLM could assist by summarizing key points from articles, research papers, or presentations related to school psychology, thus reducing the time needed to gather and process information.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time it takes to attend workshops or seminars, additional software could be developed to help school psychologists stay informed more efficiently. This software could automatically summarize workshop content, provide key takeaways, or even generate reports based on the information gathered.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities would not significantly impact the task of attending workshops, seminars, or professional meetings to stay informed about school psychology developments, as the task primarily involves reading and processing text-based information rather than dealing with images.

Based on the above analysis, the task of attending workshops, seminars, or professional meetings to remain informed of new developments in school psychology could be best classified as E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications.
