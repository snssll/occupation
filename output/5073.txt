1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of developing or managing investigation programs as a Security Manager, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. In this task, the Security Manager is responsible for overseeing the collection and preservation of video and notes related to surveillance processes or investigative interviews. The LLM can assist in tasks related to writing and transforming text, providing edits to existing text, summarizing documents, and maintaining records of written data. However, the task of managing investigation programs involves practical aspects such as handling physical surveillance equipment, coordinating with investigators, and ensuring compliance with legal requirements. While the LLM can help with generating written reports or summaries based on the collected information, it cannot directly interact with physical surveillance equipment or conduct interviews.
