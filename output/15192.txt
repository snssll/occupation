1: In this task of reviewing, developing, or preparing maintenance standards as an Electrical and Electronic Engineering Technologist or Technician, the use of an LLM could potentially reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality. The LLM could assist in researching and providing information on industry standards, regulations, and best practices related to maintenance standards. It could also help in drafting, editing, and refining the language used in the standards document. Additionally, the LLM could aid in generating examples, scenarios, or explanations to clarify the standards for different audiences.

Considering the nature of the task, which involves a significant amount of text-based research, writing, and editing, the direct access to an LLM could streamline the process by providing relevant information, suggesting language improvements, and aiding in the overall development of the maintenance standards. Therefore, this task falls under the category of E1 - Direct exposure.
