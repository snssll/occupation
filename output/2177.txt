1: In this task, the Morticians, Undertakers, and Funeral Arrangers are responsible for closing caskets and leading funeral corteges to churches or burial sites. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves physical actions such as closing caskets and leading funeral corteges, which cannot be directly assisted by an LLM. The task also requires in-person interaction and physical presence, which are not within the capabilities of the LLM. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not involve activities that can be significantly expedited or improved by the use of an LLM.
