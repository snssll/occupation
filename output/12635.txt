1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of preparing or maintaining technical files as necessary to obtain and sustain product approval for Regulatory Affairs Specialists, we need to consider the nature of the task and how LLM exposure could impact it.

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** The task involves a significant amount of writing and organizing technical information to ensure compliance with regulations. An LLM could assist in generating, summarizing, or organizing this technical content efficiently. The model could help draft sections of the technical files, provide guidance on regulatory requirements, or suggest best practices for maintaining compliance. Overall, the LLM could streamline the process of preparing and maintaining technical files, reducing the time needed to complete the task with equivalent quality.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the LLM alone can assist in writing and organizing text, additional software could be developed to enhance the capabilities further. For example, specialized software could be created to automatically retrieve and incorporate up-to-date regulatory information into the technical files, analyze complex regulatory documents, or provide real-time feedback on compliance issues. Such software could significantly improve efficiency but may not be directly achievable with the LLM alone.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Image capabilities are not directly relevant to the task of preparing or maintaining technical files for regulatory approval. This task primarily involves working with text-based documents and regulatory information, which can be effectively handled by the LLM without the need for image processing capabilities.
