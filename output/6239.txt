To determine the appropriate exposure label for this task in relation to the LLM, we can break it down as follows:

- **Establish goals for soliciting funds**: The LLM can assist in generating ideas for fundraising goals based on historical data, trends, and best practices. It can provide insights and suggestions for setting realistic and achievable targets.
