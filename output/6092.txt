1: Special Education Teachers, especially those working with preschool and elementary school students, often need to encourage their students to explore learning opportunities and persevere with challenging tasks. To determine the appropriate exposure label for this task, we can consider the following:

- Encouraging students involves providing motivation, support, and guidance through verbal communication, which can be effectively done using the LLM.
- The task does not involve any specialized domain knowledge or highly detailed information that would require additional software beyond the LLM.
- While the task may benefit from personalized approaches based on individual student needs, the general guidance and encouragement aspect can be effectively addressed by the LLM.

Based on these considerations, the task of encouraging students to explore learning opportunities or persevere with challenging tasks aligns best with the E1 label, as it involves providing guidance and motivation through written or spoken communication, which the LLM can assist with significantly.
