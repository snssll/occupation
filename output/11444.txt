1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of performing energy modeling, measurement, verification, commissioning, or retro-commissioning as an Energy Engineer, I will consider the capabilities of the OpenAI large language model (LLM). The task involves complex technical processes related to energy systems and efficiency. The LLM can assist in providing information on energy modeling techniques, definitions, and general guidance on measurement and verification processes. It can also help generate reports, analyze data, and suggest best practices based on existing knowledge. However, the task may require specialized domain knowledge, such as understanding specific energy systems, equipment, and regulations, which the LLM may not possess in-depth. While the LLM can provide general information and guidance, it may not have the expertise to perform the task independently without significant human input and oversight. Therefore, I would classify this task as E2, as additional software could be developed to enhance the LLM's capabilities for energy engineering tasks, but the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task by half.
