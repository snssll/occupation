1: Music therapists are professionals who use music interventions to help individuals achieve specific therapeutic goals. One of the tasks they may perform is adapting existing or developing new music therapy assessment instruments or procedures to meet an individual client's needs. To determine the appropriate label for this task in terms of exposure to LLM, we need to consider the complexity and specificity of music therapy assessment instruments and procedures. 

- If the task involves highly specialized domain knowledge related to music therapy, such as understanding the nuances of different assessment tools and procedures, as well as tailoring them to individual client needs, it may fall under E2. While the LLM can provide general information about music therapy, developing specific assessment instruments may require expertise beyond what the LLM can offer.
  
- On the other hand, if the task primarily involves writing and transforming text to describe the adaptation or development of assessment instruments, the task could potentially be completed with the help of the LLM, reducing the time needed to generate written content. In this case, the task could be classified as E1.
