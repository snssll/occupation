1: In this task, the appraiser of personal and business property inspects the property to determine its value. To complete this task, the appraiser needs to physically visit the property, assess its condition, take measurements, and consider various factors that could affect its value. Since this task involves physical inspection and assessment, it cannot be directly completed by an LLM. The LLM does not have the capability to physically inspect properties or gather real-time data on the condition of the property. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it cannot be significantly aided by the LLM.
