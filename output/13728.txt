1: In this task, the occupation involves Captains, Mates, and Pilots of Water Vessels who are responsible for ensuring the proper functioning of the vessel's systems by reading gauges to verify levels of hydraulic fluid, air pressure, or oxygen. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality.

- E0: This task involves physical actions such as reading gauges, which cannot be directly assisted by the LLM. The LLM does not have the capability to physically interact with the vessel's systems to verify the levels of hydraulic fluid, air pressure, or oxygen. Therefore, this task does not fall under E0.

- E1: The task of reading gauges to verify levels of fluids and pressure is a manual and practical task that requires physical interaction with the vessel's systems. While the LLM can provide information or guidance on interpreting gauge readings, it cannot directly verify the levels of hydraulic fluid, air pressure, or oxygen. As such, the LLM cannot reduce the time it takes to complete this task by at least half with equivalent quality. Therefore, this task does not fall under E1.

- E2: While it is conceivable that specialized software could be developed to assist in monitoring and interpreting gauge readings, such software would need to be integrated with physical sensors and systems on the vessel to directly verify the levels of hydraulic fluid, air pressure, or oxygen. The LLM alone cannot perform this task or significantly reduce the time it takes to complete it. Therefore, this task does not fall under E2.

- E3: The task of reading gauges does not involve image processing or detailed visual analysis that would benefit from additional image capabilities. The LLM's text-based capabilities are not directly applicable to this task. Therefore, this task does not fall under E3.
