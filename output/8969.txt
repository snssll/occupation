1: In this task, a Police Identification and Records Officer is required to look for trace evidence like fingerprints, hairs, fibers, or shoe impressions using alternative light sources when necessary. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves visual inspection and identification of trace evidence, which does not directly involve text input or output.
- The task requires physical presence and interaction with the evidence, which cannot be replaced by text-based interactions with an LLM.
- The task involves specialized skills and knowledge related to forensic analysis, which may not be effectively replicated by an LLM alone.
- While an LLM could potentially assist in providing information on forensic analysis techniques or background information on trace evidence, it cannot physically perform the task of looking for trace evidence using alternative light sources.

Based on these considerations, the task of looking for trace evidence as a Police Identification and Records Officer is best classified as E0 - No exposure.

2: E0
