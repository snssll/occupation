1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of discussing construction project proposals as a Nuclear Engineer, we need to consider the level of exposure to LLM. 

- E1: Direct exposure - In this task, the Nuclear Engineer would likely need to engage in discussions, negotiations, and decision-making with various stakeholders. While the LLM could potentially assist in preparing documentation, summarizing information, or providing background research, the core task of discussing proposals would require human interaction, understanding of complex technical details, and negotiation skills that the LLM cannot fully replicate. Therefore, direct access to the LLM alone would not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While it is conceivable that software could be developed to assist Nuclear Engineers in summarizing project details, retrieving relevant information, or even providing recommendations based on data, the core task of discussing proposals with stakeholders involves nuanced communication, decision-making, and negotiation skills that go beyond what the LLM can provide. Thus, while additional software could enhance certain aspects of the task, it would not reduce the time significantly.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities would not significantly impact the task of discussing construction project proposals with stakeholders, as this task primarily involves verbal communication, document review, and negotiation rather than image processing.

Based on the above analysis, the task of discussing construction project proposals as a Nuclear Engineer is best classified as E0 - No exposure.

2: E0

3: Certainty level: High
