1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of exposing fraudulent insurance claims or stolen funds as a Private Detective or Investigator, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. 

- The task involves investigating and uncovering fraudulent activities, which may require analyzing complex information, conducting research, and potentially writing reports based on findings.
- The LLM can assist in tasks such as analyzing written information, summarizing documents, providing feedback on documents, and generating questions based on text inputs.
- While the LLM can help with some aspects of research and analysis by providing relevant information and insights, it may not have access to real-time data or specialized domain knowledge required for investigating specific cases.
- The task may involve interacting with various sources of information, conducting interviews, and making decisions based on gathered evidence, which may not be fully supported by the LLM alone.

Based on these considerations, the task of exposing fraudulent insurance claims or stolen funds as a Private Detective or Investigator would likely fall under label E2 - Exposure by LLM-powered applications. While the LLM can assist in some aspects of the task, additional software or tools tailored for investigative work would be needed to significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task.
