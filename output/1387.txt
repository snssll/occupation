1: For the task of attaching slings, hooks, or other devices to lift cargo and guide loads, the exposure to LLM can be evaluated as follows:

- **E0**: This task involves physical actions such as attaching slings and hooks, which cannot be directly performed by an LLM or any software tool. The task also requires hands-on coordination and movement, making it unsuitable for automation by LLM or LLM-powered tools.

- **E1**: While an LLM could potentially provide information or guidance on the best practices for attaching slings and hooks, the actual physical action of performing this task cannot be automated or significantly assisted by an LLM. Therefore, the exposure to LLM in this task is limited to providing information or instructions, which may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task.

- **E2**: It is challenging to imagine additional software built on top of an LLM that could automate or assist in the physical task of attaching slings, hooks, or other devices to lift cargo. This task is highly manual and requires physical presence and action, which cannot be easily replicated by software.

- **E3**: The task of attaching slings, hooks, or other devices to lift cargo does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images. Therefore, exposure to LLM with image capabilities is not relevant for this task.
