1: In this task, a Meeting, Convention, and Event Planner consults with customers to determine objectives and requirements for events. To complete this task, the planner needs to understand the customer's needs, preferences, and goals for the event. The planner must gather information about the type of event, the number of attendees, the budget, the desired location, and any specific requests from the customer. The planner then uses this information to create a detailed plan for the event, including scheduling, logistics, and budgeting.

Using an LLM could potentially assist in this task by providing templates for event planning, suggesting questions to ask customers, offering best practices for different types of events, and generating sample event plans based on input criteria. The LLM could also help in drafting communication with customers to gather necessary information effectively.
