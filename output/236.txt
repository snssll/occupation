1: In this task, an audiologist administers hearing tests and examines patients to collect information on the type and degree of impairment using specialized instruments and electronic equipment. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if access to the LLM or LLM-powered tools can significantly reduce the time it takes for an audiologist to administer hearing tests and examine patients.

- E0: This task involves hands-on interaction with patients, specialized instruments, and electronic equipment. The task requires physical presence and direct interaction, which cannot be replaced by the LLM or any LLM-powered tools. Therefore, this task falls under E0.
