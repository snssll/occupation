1: In this task, the occupation involves steering aircraft along planned routes using autopilot and flight management computers. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves technical knowledge of aircraft systems, navigation, and flight management. While an LLM could potentially provide information on general aviation concepts, it is unlikely to have the specific domain knowledge required to operate flight management computers and autopilot systems effectively. Additionally, the task involves real-time decision-making and critical thinking, which are not areas where an LLM can currently provide direct assistance. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it requires specialized domain knowledge, real-time decision-making, and practical skills that are beyond the capabilities of the LLM.
