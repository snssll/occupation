1: In this task, a Compliance Manager serves as a confidential point of contact for employees to communicate with management, seek clarification on issues or dilemmas, or report irregularities. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves written communication and maintaining records of employee communications. An LLM could assist in generating responses to employee inquiries, drafting communication templates, summarizing employee reports, and potentially providing guidance on compliance issues based on general knowledge. However, the task also involves a high level of confidentiality and sensitivity, which may require human judgment and discretion. While the LLM can aid in generating text, the final decision-making and handling of sensitive information may still require human intervention. Therefore, this task falls under E2 - Exposure by LLM-powered applications, as additional software could be developed to streamline the process further, but the current capabilities of the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task.
