1: In this task, an Animal Scientist is required to develop improved practices in feeding, housing, sanitation, or parasite and disease control of animals. To determine the appropriate exposure label for this task in relation to the LLM, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves a high level of domain-specific knowledge related to animal science, including animal nutrition, housing requirements, sanitation practices, and disease control. While the LLM can provide general information on these topics, it may not have access to the most up-to-date and specialized knowledge required for developing improved practices in these areas. Additionally, the task involves practical considerations and field-specific expertise that may not be effectively addressed by the LLM alone. Therefore, the task does not fall under E1, as the LLM alone cannot significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality. It also does not fall under E2, as developing specialized software on top of the LLM to address the specific needs of animal science would be complex and may not lead to a significant time reduction. The task does not involve image capabilities, so it does not fall under E3 either. Considering these factors, the most appropriate label for this task is E0.

2: E0

3: High
