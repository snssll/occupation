1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of developing expertise in subject matters related to committee assignments for Legislators, we need to consider how the task can be completed with the help of an LLM.

- E0: This task involves developing expertise in specific subject matters, which may require in-depth research, analysis, and understanding of complex information. While an LLM can provide general information and insights on a wide range of topics, it may not have the specialized knowledge or up-to-date information required to develop expertise in specific subject matters related to committee assignments.

- E1: An LLM could potentially assist in providing general information, summaries, or overviews of subject matters related to committee assignments. It could help in generating initial insights or ideas, but developing expertise would likely require in-depth research, consultation with experts, and practical experience, which may not be fully achievable through the LLM alone.

- E2: While an LLM could be used to gather general information or insights on various subjects related to committee assignments, developing expertise would likely require additional tools or software that can provide specialized domain knowledge, up-to-date facts, and in-depth analysis. Such tools could be developed on top of the LLM to streamline the research process and provide more targeted information to support the legislators in developing expertise.

- E3: This task does not involve image-related capabilities, so exposure to LLM with image capabilities would not significantly impact the completion of the task.

Based on the above considerations, the task of developing expertise in subject matters related to committee assignments for Legislators is best classified as E2.
