1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of creating or reviewing technical design documentation as a Business Intelligence Analyst, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can benefit from the use of a large language model (LLM) like OpenAI's model.

- Business Intelligence Analysts typically deal with data analysis, reporting, and decision-making processes within an organization. Creating or reviewing technical design documentation for reporting solutions involves a significant amount of text-based work, including documenting requirements, data models, and specifications.

- An LLM can assist in this task by helping to generate detailed and accurate technical documentation based on the input provided. The model can understand complex instructions, transform text, and provide edits to existing text following specifications. It can also summarize information and answer questions about documents, which are essential aspects of creating or reviewing technical design documentation.

- While the task may not directly benefit from image capabilities, it can greatly benefit from the text-based capabilities of the LLM. The model can help streamline the documentation process, ensure accuracy, and provide valuable insights into the reporting solutions being developed.

Based on these considerations, the task of creating or reviewing technical design documentation for reporting solutions as a Business Intelligence Analyst would likely fall under the label E1 - Direct exposure.
