1: For the task of printing and making copies of work as a Word Processor and Typist, let's consider the exposure rubric:

- E1 (Direct exposure): This task involves a straightforward and repetitive action of printing and making copies of work. The LLM could potentially assist in providing instructions on how to operate the printing equipment or troubleshoot common issues. However, the task itself does not require complex instructions, edits, translations, summarizations, or any other text-related functions that would significantly benefit from the LLM's capabilities. Therefore, direct access to the LLM may not reduce the time it takes to complete this task by at least half.

- E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications): While it is conceivable that additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to automate the printing and copying process, the nature of this task is quite simple and may not require the advanced capabilities of the LLM. The task primarily involves physical actions related to operating printing equipment, which may not be significantly enhanced by LLM-powered applications.

- E3 (Exposure given image capabilities): This task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images. Therefore, the image capabilities provided by the LLM are not relevant to this task.

Based on the analysis above, the task of printing and making copies of work as a Word Processor and Typist is best classified as E0 (No exposure) since the task does not clearly benefit from the capabilities of the LLM to reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete it.

2: E0

3: Certainty level: High
