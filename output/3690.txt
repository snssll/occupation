1: In this task, the dancer needs to coordinate their movements with those of their partners or dance ensembles. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes for a dancer to complete this task with high quality. Since this task involves physical coordination and movement, it cannot be directly completed using text input and output capabilities of the LLM. The LLM does not have the ability to physically coordinate movements or interact in real-time with partners or ensembles. Therefore, the task does not fall under E1, E2, or E3 as it cannot be completed using the LLM or any tools built on top of it.

2: E0

3: High
