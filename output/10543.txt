1: In this task, a locomotive engineer is required to observe tracks to detect obstructions. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality. 

- Locomotive engineers typically rely on visual observation and experience to detect obstructions on tracks. The task does not involve text input or output, and the context is primarily visual.
- The LLM does not have the capability to view images or physical objects directly, so it cannot assist in real-time visual observation tasks like detecting obstructions on tracks.
- While the LLM could potentially provide information on track maintenance, safety procedures, or regulations related to locomotive engineering, it cannot directly observe tracks or physical obstructions.
