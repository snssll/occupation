1: In this task, a Library Technician is responsible for maintaining and troubleshooting problems with various types of library equipment. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality.

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** The LLM could potentially assist in providing troubleshooting guides, step-by-step instructions, or explanations for common issues related to library equipment. It could also help in generating documentation for maintenance procedures. However, the task involves hands-on work with physical equipment, which cannot be directly addressed by the LLM. Therefore, the direct exposure to the LLM may not reduce the time significantly for this task.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the LLM alone may not reduce the time to complete this task, it is conceivable that additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to create interactive troubleshooting guides, maintenance schedules, or equipment databases that could streamline the maintenance process. Such software could integrate with the LLM to provide real-time solutions based on the reported issues.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Image capabilities would not significantly impact the completion of this task as it primarily involves troubleshooting and maintaining physical equipment rather than dealing with visual information.

Considering the nature of the task involving hands-on troubleshooting of physical equipment, the most appropriate exposure label would be **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications)**.

2: E2
