1: In this task, riggers are responsible for installing ground rigging for yarding lines, attaching chokers to logs, and to the lines. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves physical work such as installing ground rigging and attaching chokers to logs and lines, which cannot be directly performed by an LLM. The task requires hands-on skills, knowledge of safety procedures, and physical coordination, which are beyond the capabilities of the LLM. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not involve activities that can be significantly aided by the LLM.
