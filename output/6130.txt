1: In this task, an Insurance Sales Agent is responsible for ensuring that policy requirements are met, which includes coordinating medical examinations and completing necessary forms. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we can break down the task:
- The task involves a significant amount of text-based communication, documentation, and coordination.
- The task requires understanding policy requirements and ensuring compliance.
- The task involves interacting with clients, medical professionals, and potentially other stakeholders.
- The task may involve some level of decision-making based on the information gathered.

Given these considerations, the task could benefit from the use of an LLM to assist in drafting communication, summarizing policy requirements, generating forms, and potentially even providing guidance on decision-making based on the information provided.
