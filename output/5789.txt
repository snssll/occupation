1: In this task, a crossing guard or flagger is responsible for distributing traffic control signs and markers at designated points to ensure the safety of pedestrians and vehicles. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be impacted by the use of an LLM.

- The task of distributing traffic control signs and markers involves physical actions such as placing signs in specific locations. This task does not involve complex decision-making, analysis, or writing that could be significantly enhanced by the use of an LLM.
- While an LLM could potentially provide information on traffic control regulations or guidelines, the core task of physically distributing signs and markers is not directly impacted by the capabilities of an LLM.
- The task does not involve text input or output, complex instructions, data analysis, or specialized knowledge retrieval that would benefit from LLM capabilities.

Based on these considerations, the task of distributing traffic control signs and markers at designated points is best classified as E0 - No exposure to LLM.
