1: In this task, the occupation involves installing metal or wooden studs to frames for attaching wallboard to interior walls. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if the task can be significantly expedited or improved by using the LLM. Since this task involves physical construction work that requires precise measurements, manual labor, and on-site installation, it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM. The LLM cannot perform physical tasks, handle materials, or make on-site decisions. Therefore, the task does not fall under E1, E2, or E3 as the LLM cannot directly assist in completing the task.

2: E0

3: High
