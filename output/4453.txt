1: In this task, a Library Technician is required to design posters and special displays to promote the use of library facilities or specific reading programs. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves creativity and design skills, which are not directly related to text input and output. 
- While the LLM can potentially assist in generating text content for the posters or providing ideas for promotions, the core aspect of designing visually appealing posters and displays is not a direct strength of the LLM.
- The task does not involve complex text transformations, summarization, or data analysis that the LLM excels at.
- Additionally, the task does not require accessing up-to-date facts or specialized domain knowledge that the LLM could provide.

Based on these considerations, the task of designing posters and special displays for library promotions falls under E0 as it does not significantly benefit from the capabilities of the LLM.
