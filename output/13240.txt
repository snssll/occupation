1: In this task, a Health Informatics Specialist is required to provide consultation to nurses regarding hardware or software configuration. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM can assist in completing it. 

- E0: This task involves direct interaction and consultation with nurses, which requires human expertise and communication skills. The LLM cannot replace the need for direct human interaction in providing consultation.
- E1: The LLM could potentially assist in generating documentation or guidelines for hardware or software configuration that the Health Informatics Specialist can use during consultations with nurses. It can help in preparing materials or responses based on general knowledge in the field of health informatics.
- E2: While the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to provide recommendations for hardware or software configuration based on specific data or inputs from nurses. This software could analyze information to inform decisions and provide counsel on technical configurations.
- E3: The task does not involve image capabilities, so exposure given image capabilities is not relevant in this context.
