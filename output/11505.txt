1: In this task, a dermatologist is required to perform incisional biopsies to diagnose melanoma. This task involves a high level of expertise, precision, and hands-on skill. The task cannot be completed solely through text input and output, as it requires physical interaction with patients, instruments, and tissues. The task also involves making real-time decisions based on visual and tactile feedback during the biopsy procedure. While an LLM could potentially provide information on the procedure, risks, and guidelines related to incisional biopsies, it cannot physically perform the biopsy itself. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it cannot be significantly aided by the LLM in terms of reducing time or improving quality.
