1: In this task, an Occupational Health and Safety Technician is required to test or balance newly installed HVAC systems to ensure indoor air quality standards are met. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be significantly aided by the use of the language model. 

- The task involves technical knowledge related to HVAC systems and indoor air quality standards, which may not be directly related to text-based information that an LLM can provide.
- While the technician may need to refer to guidelines or standards which could potentially be accessed through the LLM, the actual testing and balancing of HVAC systems require hands-on work and technical expertise beyond what a language model can offer.
- The task does not involve writing, summarizing documents, or accessing specialized domain knowledge that an LLM could significantly assist with.

Based on these considerations, it is unlikely that the task of testing or balancing HVAC systems for indoor air quality standards can be significantly aided by the LLM, leading to a classification of E0.

2: E0
