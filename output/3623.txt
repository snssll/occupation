1: In this task, the occupation of riggers involves controlling the movement of heavy equipment through narrow openings or confined spaces using various equipment. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality. 

Given the nature of the task, which involves physical manipulation of heavy equipment in real-world scenarios, it is unlikely that the LLM or any tools built on top of it can directly assist in completing the task. The task requires hands-on skills, physical strength, and knowledge of rigging equipment, which cannot be substituted by text-based or image-based assistance. Therefore, the task falls under E0 as it does not meet the criteria for exposure to LLM capabilities.
