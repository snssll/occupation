1: In this task, the Adhesive Bonding Machine Operators and Tenders are required to measure and mix ingredients to prepare glue. This task involves manual labor and physical interaction with materials, which cannot be directly replaced by an LLM. The process of measuring and mixing ingredients is hands-on and requires physical dexterity, which is beyond the capabilities of the LLM. Additionally, the task does not involve complex text input or output that the LLM could assist with. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it cannot be significantly expedited or improved by the use of an LLM.
