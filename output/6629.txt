1: In this task, a Painting, Coating, and Decorating Worker is required to examine finished surfaces of workpieces to ensure they meet specifications and retouch any defective areas. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we can break down the task:
- The task involves visual inspection and decision-making based on the specifications provided.
- The worker needs to have knowledge of what constitutes a defective area and how to retouch it.
- The task does not involve complex data analysis or specialized domain knowledge beyond the scope of a typical worker in this occupation.

Given these considerations, the task does not require the use of an LLM or any additional software beyond what is typically available to a worker in this occupation. The task is primarily hands-on and relies on the worker's expertise in painting, coating, and decorating. Therefore, the task falls under E0 as it does not benefit significantly from LLM exposure.
