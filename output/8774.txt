1: In this task, a Child, Family, and School Social Worker is required to lead group counseling sessions that provide support in areas such as grief, stress, or chemical dependency. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. This task involves human interaction, emotional support, and counseling skills that require empathy, active listening, and understanding of human behavior. While an LLM can provide information on counseling techniques and theoretical knowledge, it cannot replace the human touch and personalized support needed in counseling sessions. The task also involves real-time interaction and adaptation to the emotional needs of the group members, which are beyond the capabilities of an LLM. Therefore, the task falls under E0 as it requires a high degree of human interaction and emotional intelligence that cannot be replicated by an LLM.
