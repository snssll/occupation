1: In this task, the occupation involves operating curbing machines to extrude concrete or asphalt curbing. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality. Since this task involves physical operation of machinery and hands-on work, it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM, which is focused on text-based tasks. The LLM cannot physically operate machinery or perform tasks that require physical presence. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not benefit from the capabilities of the LLM.

2: E0

3: High
