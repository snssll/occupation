1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of evaluating new blockchain technologies and vendor products as a Blockchain Engineer, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be impacted by the use of the OpenAI large language model (LLM).

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** The task of evaluating new blockchain technologies and vendor products involves a significant amount of research, analysis, and comparison. The LLM can assist in this process by providing up-to-date information on various blockchain technologies, vendor products, and industry trends. The model can help in summarizing information, generating comparisons, and even providing insights based on the data available. This direct access to the LLM can streamline the research process and enhance the quality of the evaluation.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the LLM can provide valuable information and insights, additional software specifically tailored for evaluating blockchain technologies and vendor products could further enhance the efficiency of the task. Such software could be designed to extract and analyze data from various sources, generate detailed comparisons, and even make recommendations based on specific criteria. This additional software could potentially reduce the time required for the evaluation process by half.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Image capabilities are not directly relevant to the task of evaluating blockchain technologies and vendor products. This task primarily involves text-based research, analysis, and decision-making, which can be effectively supported by the text capabilities of the LLM.

Based on the above considerations, the task of evaluating new blockchain technologies and vendor products as a Blockchain Engineer is best classified as **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications)**.
