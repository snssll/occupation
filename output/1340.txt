1: For the task of assisting with the operations of general facilities like visitor centers as a Park Naturalist, the exposure to LLM can be evaluated as follows:

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** The task involves general operations at visitor centers, which may require writing, responding to emails, maintaining records, and providing information to visitors. The LLM can assist in generating responses to emails, drafting informational materials, and maintaining records efficiently. It can also help in providing information to visitors by generating responses or FAQs. Overall, the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete these tasks with equivalent quality.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the LLM alone can handle tasks related to writing, responding to emails, and providing information, developing additional software on top of the LLM could further enhance capabilities. For example, specialized software could be created to manage visitor data, analyze visitor trends, or provide personalized recommendations to visitors based on their interests. This additional software could streamline operations at visitor centers even more.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Image capabilities are not directly relevant to the task of assisting with general facilities like visitor centers. Therefore, this task does not fall under E3.

Based on the above analysis, the task of assisting with operations of general facilities like visitor centers as a Park Naturalist is best classified as **E1 (Direct exposure)**.
