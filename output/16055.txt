1: For the task of sorting or classifying information according to guidelines, an LLM could potentially assist by providing guidelines on how to categorize information based on content, purpose, user criteria, or order. The LLM could generate sample classifications or sorting criteria based on the input provided. It could also help in creating templates for organizing information in a chronological, alphabetical, or numerical order. However, since this task primarily involves manual organization and physical handling of documents, the LLM's assistance may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task. While the LLM can provide guidance and suggestions, the actual sorting and classifying would still need to be done manually.
