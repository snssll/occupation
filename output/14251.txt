1: In this task, a Coin, Vending, and Amusement Machine Servicer and Repairer needs to refer to manuals and wiring diagrams to gather information for repairing machines. With access to the powerful OpenAI large language model (LLM), the worker can potentially input the specific details or questions related to the manuals and wiring diagrams to quickly retrieve relevant information. The LLM can assist in summarizing complex manuals, providing explanations for technical terms, and even generating troubleshooting steps based on the information provided. This would significantly reduce the time it takes to gather the necessary information for machine repairs.

Considering the task involves text input (manuals and wiring diagrams) and text output (information needed for repair), the LLM can directly assist in transforming and summarizing text according to complex instructions. Therefore, this task falls under the E1 label as direct access to the LLM can reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality by at least half.
