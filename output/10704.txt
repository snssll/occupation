1: In this task, the Petroleum Pump System Operators, Refinery Operators, and Gaugers are required to operate auxiliary equipment and control multiple processing units during distilling or treating operations. This task involves moving controls that regulate valves, pumps, compressors, and auxiliary equipment. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality.

Given the nature of the task, which involves physical operation and control of equipment in a refinery setting, it is unlikely that access to the LLM alone or any software built on top of it could reduce the time it takes to complete the task by at least half. The task requires hands-on operation, monitoring, and control of equipment, which cannot be directly substituted by text-based interactions with the LLM. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not meet the criteria for exposure to LLM capabilities.

2: E0

3: High
