1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of preparing and filing annual tax returns or preparing financial information for outside accountants, we need to consider the level of exposure to LLM.

- E0: This task involves specific financial and tax knowledge that may require human judgment and expertise. It may involve dealing with sensitive financial information and legal compliance, which may not be suitable for automation using LLM alone.

- E1: While the task involves writing and transforming financial information, tax returns, and related documents, it also requires a deep understanding of tax laws, regulations, and financial reporting standards. The LLM could assist in generating some parts of the documentation, but the complexity and legal implications of tax preparation may limit the extent to which the LLM can significantly reduce the time needed to complete the task with equivalent quality.

- E2: With additional software development, it is conceivable that an application could be built on top of the LLM to assist in summarizing financial information, cross-referencing tax laws, and providing recommendations based on the data provided. This software could potentially streamline the process of preparing tax returns or financial information for accountants.

- E3: The task does not involve image capabilities, so exposure to LLM with image capabilities is not relevant in this context.

Based on the considerations above, the task of preparing and filing annual tax returns or preparing financial information for outside accountants is best classified as E2.
