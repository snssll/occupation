1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of designing research projects as a Statistician, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it. 

- The task involves designing research projects that apply valid scientific techniques, utilizing information from baselines or historical data for analysis. This task requires a deep understanding of statistical methods, research design, and data analysis.
- The LLM could assist in providing information on statistical methods, research design principles, and data analysis techniques. It could also help generate ideas for structuring research projects and analyses.
- However, the task of designing research projects as a Statistician involves a high level of expertise, critical thinking, and domain-specific knowledge that may not be fully captured by the LLM alone. The LLM may provide some general guidance or information, but the intricate details and decision-making involved in designing research projects may require human expertise.

Based on these considerations, the task of designing research projects as a Statistician would likely fall under E2 - Exposure by LLM-powered applications. While the LLM can provide some assistance and information related to statistical methods and research design, additional software specifically tailored for statistical analysis and research project design would be needed to significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task.
