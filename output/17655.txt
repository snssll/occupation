1: In this task, a Lighting Technician is required to visit locations to assess the structural and electrical layout before setting up lighting equipment. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone or with additional software could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality.

- E0: This task involves physical inspection of locations, which cannot be replaced by text-based interactions with the LLM. The LLM cannot physically visit locations or assess structural and electrical layouts.
- E1: The LLM could potentially assist in providing information on best practices for lighting setup, safety guidelines, or troubleshooting tips based on text input. However, it cannot physically assess locations.
- E2: While the LLM alone may not reduce the time significantly for this task, additional software could be developed to provide virtual simulations of locations based on descriptions, allowing for preliminary assessments before physical visits.
- E3: Image capabilities could potentially assist by providing digital images of locations based on descriptions, allowing for some level of remote assessment. However, the task still primarily involves physical inspection.
