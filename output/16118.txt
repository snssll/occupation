1: In this task, a construction laborer is required to spray materials through hoses to clean, coat, or seal surfaces. To determine the exposure label for this task, we need to consider if the task can be significantly expedited or improved by using the LLM. The task itself is very hands-on and physical, involving the operation of equipment and direct interaction with surfaces. The task does not involve complex decision-making, analysis, or require specialized knowledge that the LLM could provide. Therefore, it is unlikely that the LLM can reduce the time it takes to complete this task with high quality.
