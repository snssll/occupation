1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of constructing forms and assisting in raising them to the required elevation as a Helper Carpenter, we need to consider the nature of the task. This task involves physical construction work that requires hands-on skills and manual labor. The task does not involve text input or output, complex instructions, data analysis, or decision-making that can be easily automated or assisted by an LLM. The task is primarily physical in nature and cannot be significantly expedited or improved by using an LLM or LLM-powered tools. Therefore, based on the criteria provided in the exposure rubric, this task falls under E0 as it does not meet the criteria for exposure to LLM capabilities.
