1: In this task, a secondary school teacher is required to instruct and monitor students in the use of equipment and materials to prevent injuries and damage. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be significantly aided by the use of the language model. The task involves providing instructions and monitoring students, which are primarily hands-on activities that require physical presence and interaction. While the LLM could potentially assist in generating instructional materials or safety guidelines, the core aspect of physically monitoring students to prevent injuries and damage cannot be effectively replaced by the model. Therefore, the task does not align with the capabilities of the LLM, and it falls under E0.

2: E0

3: High
