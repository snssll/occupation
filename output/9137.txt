1: In this task, a First-Line Supervisor of Gambling Services Workers is required to maintain familiarity with the games at a facility and with strategies or tricks used by cheaters at such games. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- E0: This task involves understanding and staying updated on the games and cheating strategies in the gambling industry. While an LLM can provide general information on games and strategies, it may not have access to real-time or highly specialized information on specific games or current cheating methods. The task also involves practical knowledge and experience that may not be effectively replaced by an LLM.

- E1: The task involves gathering and maintaining knowledge about games and cheating strategies, which can be done through research and reading. An LLM can assist in summarizing information, providing insights, and generating questions for further investigation. However, the task may require hands-on experience and interaction in the gambling environment, which an LLM cannot provide.

- E2: While an LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time to complete this task, additional software could be developed to enhance the supervisor's capabilities. For example, a specialized tool could be created to aggregate and summarize information on various games and cheating methods, providing more efficient access to relevant data. This tool could work in conjunction with the LLM to provide comprehensive insights.

- E3: This task does not involve image processing capabilities, so it does not fall under this category.
