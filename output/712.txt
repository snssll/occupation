1: In this task, the cashier's responsibility is to answer incoming phone calls. This task involves communication skills, customer service, and the ability to provide information or direct calls appropriately. With the help of the LLM, the cashier could potentially receive guidance on handling different types of calls, scripting responses for common inquiries, or even practicing responses to difficult situations. The LLM could provide templates for responding to various scenarios, offer suggestions on how to handle specific customer inquiries, or even assist in language translation if needed. Overall, the LLM could significantly reduce the time it takes for a cashier to prepare for and handle incoming phone calls effectively.

Considering the task's nature and the potential for the LLM to provide valuable support in terms of communication guidance and scripting, I would classify this task as E1 - Direct exposure.
