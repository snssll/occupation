1: In this task, the Manufactured Building and Mobile Home Installers are responsible for moving and setting up mobile homes or prefabricated buildings on owners' lots or at mobile home parks. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. This task involves physical labor, coordination, and specialized skills related to construction and installation. While the task description does not explicitly mention the need for written or text-based work, it is primarily hands-on and requires practical knowledge and physical effort. The task does not involve complex text-based instructions, data analysis, or information retrieval that could significantly benefit from the use of an LLM. Therefore, the task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM or systems built on top of it.
