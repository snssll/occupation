1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of planning and conducting research as a sociologist using an LLM, we need to consider the nature of the task. Sociologists typically engage in complex research activities that involve formulating hypotheses, designing studies, collecting and analyzing data, and interpreting results to develop and test theories about societal issues. While an LLM can assist with tasks such as summarizing existing research, generating questions, or providing background information on specific topics, the core activities of planning and conducting original research require specialized knowledge, critical thinking, and methodological expertise that go beyond the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves a high level of human judgment, creativity, and domain-specific knowledge that cannot be fully automated by the LLM.
