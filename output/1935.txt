1: In this task, the helper-production worker is responsible for cleaning and lubricating equipment. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM would significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality. 

- E0: This task involves physical actions such as cleaning and lubricating equipment, which cannot be directly assisted by the LLM. The LLM cannot physically interact with equipment, so it cannot directly perform the task.
- E1: The LLM could potentially provide written instructions on how to clean and lubricate specific types of equipment, but it cannot physically carry out the task. While it could offer guidance or information on the best practices for cleaning and lubricating equipment, the actual execution of the task still requires manual labor.
- E2: It is challenging to imagine additional software built on top of the LLM that could significantly reduce the time it takes to clean and lubricate equipment. This task is more about physical actions rather than information processing or decision-making that could be automated.
- E3: The task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images, so the image capabilities of the LLM are not relevant here.

Based on the above analysis, the most appropriate exposure label for this task is E0.

2: E0

3: High
