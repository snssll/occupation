1: For the task of making repairs as a jeweler, the exposure to LLM can be evaluated as follows:

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** The task involves specific instructions and procedures related to jewelry repair, which can be easily communicated to the LLM for assistance in generating text-based instructions, providing guidance on techniques, or even suggesting alternative repair methods. The LLM can help in writing detailed repair instructions, summarizing repair techniques, or generating responses to common repair questions.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time to complete the task, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to provide visual aids for repair techniques, access to a database of common repair issues and solutions, or even virtual simulations for practicing repair skills. This additional software could enhance the efficiency of completing the repair tasks.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Image capabilities could be useful for tasks like identifying specific jewelry components, providing visual references for repair techniques, or creating digital images of repaired jewelry for documentation purposes. However, since the task primarily involves text-based instructions and practical repair skills, the reliance on image capabilities may not significantly impact the completion time.
