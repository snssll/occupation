1: In this task, a Web Administrator is responsible for testing backup or recovery plans regularly and resolving any problems that may arise. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it. 

- The task involves a technical aspect related to IT infrastructure management, specifically backup and recovery plans. The LLM could potentially assist in providing general guidance on best practices for testing backup and recovery plans.
- The LLM could also help in generating documentation or checklists for conducting regular tests and troubleshooting common issues that may occur during the process.
- However, the task may require hands-on technical skills and interactions with specific software tools or systems that the LLM may not be able to directly operate or control.
- While the LLM can provide information and recommendations, it may not have the capability to execute the actual testing or resolution of problems in the IT environment.

Based on these considerations, the task of testing backup or recovery plans regularly and resolving any problems falls under the E2 exposure label. While the LLM can provide valuable information and guidance, additional specialized software or tools tailored to IT infrastructure management would be needed to fully automate or streamline this task.
