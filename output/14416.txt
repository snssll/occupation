1: In this task, a Rail Car Repairer is required to remove locomotives, car mechanical units, or other components using various tools and equipment. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality. Since this task involves physical work, such as using pneumatic hoists, jacks, hand tools, and cutting torches, it falls under the category of tasks that require physical interaction and precise measurements, which are classified as E0. The LLM cannot perform physical tasks or make decisions that require physical actions.

2: E0

3: High
