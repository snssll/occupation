1: In this task, a Legal Secretary or Administrative Assistant is responsible for submitting articles and information from searches to attorneys for review and approval for use. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM can assist in completing it. 

- The task involves searching for articles and information, which can be time-consuming and require sifting through large amounts of text.
- The LLM can assist in searching for relevant articles and information based on specific criteria provided by the attorney.
- The LLM can summarize the articles and information found, making it easier for the assistant to present the key points to the attorney.
- The LLM can also help in drafting summaries or reports based on the articles found, saving time for the assistant.

Based on these considerations, the task can be significantly expedited and improved in quality by using the LLM to assist in searching, summarizing, and drafting reports, leading to a reduction in time required for completion.
