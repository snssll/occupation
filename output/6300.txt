1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of estimating costs of vehicle repair as an Automotive Service Technicians and Mechanics, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves analyzing the extent of damage to a vehicle, identifying necessary repairs, and estimating the costs involved. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM can assist in providing information on common repair costs, parts pricing, and labor estimates based on historical data and industry standards. It can help in generating detailed reports or breakdowns of repair costs based on the input provided.
- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time to complete the task, additional software could be developed to integrate with the LLM. This software could retrieve up-to-date pricing information from various sources, analyze repair data trends, and provide more accurate cost estimates.
- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not directly relevant to estimating costs of vehicle repair, as the task primarily involves textual information and calculations based on repair requirements.

Based on the above analysis, the task of estimating costs of vehicle repair aligns best with E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications.
