1: In this task, a Forensic Science Technician is required to collect impressions of dust from surfaces to obtain and identify fingerprints. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality by at least half.

- Direct exposure (E1): The task involves physical actions such as collecting dust impressions, which cannot be directly performed by the LLM. While the LLM could potentially assist in providing information on fingerprint identification techniques or theories, it cannot physically collect dust impressions.

- Exposure by LLM-powered applications (E2): It is challenging to imagine additional software built on top of the LLM that could reduce the time it takes to physically collect dust impressions. The task is highly practical and requires hands-on work that goes beyond the capabilities of the LLM.

- Exposure given image capabilities (E3): Image capabilities would not significantly impact the ability to collect dust impressions for fingerprint identification. This task is more about physical collection techniques rather than image processing.

Based on the above analysis, the task of collecting impressions of dust from surfaces to obtain and identify fingerprints is best classified as E0 - No exposure.

2: E0

3: Certainty level: High
