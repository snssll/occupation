1: In this task, a landscaping and groundskeeping worker is required to plant various types of vegetation and apply mulch using gardening tools. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if the task can be significantly expedited or improved by using the LLM. 

- The task involves physical actions such as planting seeds and using gardening tools, which cannot be directly assisted by the LLM.
- The knowledge required for this task is practical and hands-on, focusing on plant care and landscaping techniques.
- The task does not involve complex decision-making, analysis of large amounts of data, or specialized domain knowledge that the LLM could provide.

Based on these considerations, it is evident that the task of planting seeds, bulbs, foliage, plants, etc., in landscaping and groundskeeping work does not benefit from LLM assistance in a way that would significantly reduce the time or improve the quality of completion. Therefore, this task falls under the E0 category.
