1: In this task, a Regulatory Affairs Manager is responsible for establishing procedures or systems for publishing document submissions in hardcopy or electronic formats. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves creating procedures or systems, which may require writing and transforming text to outline the steps involved in publishing document submissions.
- The task may involve providing edits to existing documents or creating new documents that detail the submission process.
- The task could potentially involve summarizing information related to document publishing procedures.
- The task may require generating questions or feedback related to the document submission process.
- The task could involve maintaining records of document submissions procedures.

Given these considerations, the task can be significantly aided by the use of an LLM to help with writing, editing, summarizing, generating questions, and maintaining records related to document submissions procedures. The LLM can assist in creating detailed and clear procedures or systems for publishing document submissions, which can save time and improve the quality of the documentation.
