1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of preparing hydrogeologic evaluations of known or suspected hazardous waste sites and land treatment and feedlot facilities as a Hydrologist, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be aided by the use of a large language model (LLM).

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** If the task involves writing reports, analyzing data, and providing detailed evaluations based on existing information, an LLM could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task. The LLM can assist in generating technical reports, analyzing hydrogeologic data, and providing insights based on the input data. This would qualify as E1 exposure.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While an LLM alone may not reduce the time it takes to complete the task by half, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to summarize complex hydrogeologic data, retrieve up-to-date information on hazardous waste sites, and provide recommendations based on the analysis. This task could benefit from specialized tools that combine LLM capabilities with domain-specific knowledge, making it suitable for E2 exposure.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Since the task involves evaluating hazardous waste sites and land treatment facilities, having image capabilities to view and analyze site maps, diagrams, or satellite images could enhance the analysis process. However, since the task primarily involves text-based evaluations, the need for image capabilities may not be as significant, making E3 less applicable.
