1: In this task, a Rolling Machine Setter, Operator, and Tender in the Metal and Plastic industry is required to signal and assist other workers to remove and position equipment, fill hoppers, and feed materials into machines. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves physical actions such as signaling, assisting, and handling equipment, which cannot be directly performed by an LLM. The task does not involve complex text input or output that can be significantly aided by an LLM. Therefore, the task does not align with any of the exposure levels in the rubric as it does not involve tasks that can be completed or significantly aided by an LLM.
