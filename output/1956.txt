1: In this task, a data scientist is required to clean and manipulate raw data using statistical software. With the help of a large language model (LLM), the data scientist could potentially receive guidance on best practices for data cleaning and manipulation, as well as specific code snippets or scripts to automate certain parts of the process. The LLM could provide explanations, examples, and even generate code based on the input provided. This would significantly reduce the time it takes for the data scientist to complete the task with high quality, as they can leverage the LLM's capabilities to streamline the data cleaning and manipulation process.

Considering the nature of the task and the potential for the LLM to provide valuable insights and code snippets, I would classify this task as E1 - Direct exposure. The LLM can directly assist in writing and transforming text and code according to complex instructions, which aligns with the task of cleaning and manipulating raw data using statistical software.
