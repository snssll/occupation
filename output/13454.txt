1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of providing requested information on students' progress and the development of case plans as a Residential Advisor, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could assist in completing it.

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** The task involves writing and transforming text to provide information on students' progress and case plans. The LLM can help in generating detailed reports, summaries, and updates based on the input data provided. It can assist in organizing and presenting the information in a clear and concise manner, saving time compared to manually compiling reports.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the LLM can aid in generating text and summaries, additional software could be developed to streamline the process further. For example, a specialized application could be created to automatically extract relevant data from student records, analyze trends, and suggest recommendations for case plans based on predefined criteria. This additional software could enhance the efficiency of the task beyond what the LLM alone can achieve.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Image capabilities are not directly relevant to the task of providing information on students' progress and case plans. The task primarily involves text-based information and does not require image processing or analysis.

Based on the above analysis, the task of providing requested information on students' progress and case plans as a Residential Advisor aligns most closely with **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications)** as additional software could be developed to further enhance the efficiency of completing the task.
