1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of performing discharge planning for patients as a Clinical Nurse Specialist, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be supported by the capabilities of the LLM.

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** The task of performing discharge planning for patients involves a significant amount of text-based information processing, such as reviewing patient records, documenting care plans, and communicating with healthcare teams. An LLM could assist in generating detailed discharge instructions, summarizing patient histories, or drafting communication messages. The LLM could also help in providing standardized templates for discharge planning based on best practices. Overall, the LLM can significantly reduce the time required for these text-based tasks with equivalent quality.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the LLM alone can assist in generating text-based content for discharge planning, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to enhance its capabilities further. For example, an application could be created that integrates with electronic health records to automatically extract relevant patient information for discharge planning, or a tool that provides real-time updates on best practices and guidelines for discharge planning. These additional features could streamline the discharge planning process even more.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** The task of discharge planning for patients does not involve image processing or creation, so the image capabilities of the LLM would not significantly impact the completion of this task.
