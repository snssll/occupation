1: In this task, a Social Science Research Assistant is required to provide assistance in the design of survey instruments such as questionnaires. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves writing and transforming text according to complex instructions, specifically in designing survey instruments. The LLM can assist in generating questions, structuring the questionnaire, and providing feedback on the wording.
- The task does not involve accessing up-to-date facts or highly specialized domain knowledge that the LLM alone cannot provide.
- While additional software could potentially be developed to streamline the process of designing survey instruments, the task itself can be effectively completed with the direct use of the LLM.

Based on these considerations, the task falls under E1 as direct access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality.
