1: In this task, a Costume Attendant is responsible for directing the work of wardrobe crews during dress rehearsals or performances. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone or with additional software could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality.

- E0: This task involves direct human interaction and physical coordination, which cannot be replaced by the LLM or any software tool. The nuances of directing wardrobe crews, especially during live performances, require human judgment and real-time decision-making.

- E1: While the LLM could potentially provide some guidance on best practices for directing wardrobe crews, the real-time nature of this task and the need for physical coordination make it unlikely that the LLM alone could reduce the time to complete the task by at least half with equivalent quality.

- E2: It is conceivable that specialized software could be developed on top of the LLM to assist Costume Attendants in organizing wardrobe crews and providing real-time suggestions during dress rehearsals or performances. This software could potentially streamline communication and coordination, but the physical aspect of directing the work would still require human intervention.

- E3: The task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images, so the image capabilities of the LLM are not relevant here.

Based on the above analysis, the most appropriate label for this task is E2.

2: E2

3: Moderate
