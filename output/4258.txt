1: In this task, an Adhesive Bonding Machine Operator and Tender is required to depress pedals to lower electrodes that heat and seal edges of material. This task involves physical interaction with machinery, specifically operating a machine by pressing pedals. The task does not involve complex decision-making, analysis, or interpretation of information beyond the physical action of operating the machine. Since the task is purely physical and does not involve text input or output, it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM. The LLM cannot operate machinery or perform physical tasks. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not benefit from the capabilities of the LLM.

2: E0
