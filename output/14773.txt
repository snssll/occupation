1: In this task, a Landscape Architect is required to research the latest products, technology, or design trends to stay current in the field. With access to the most powerful OpenAI large language model (LLM), the model can assist in conducting this research by providing up-to-date information on products, technology, and design trends within the field of landscape architecture. The LLM can help summarize articles, reports, and other sources of information, saving time on reading and extracting relevant details. It can also generate insights and recommendations based on the data it processes. However, since the task involves retrieving information from sources outside the 2000-word context limit of the LLM, it may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task by at least half. While additional software could potentially be developed to enhance the capabilities of the LLM for this task, such as a tool that retrieves up-to-date facts from the internet and combines them with the LLM's abilities, the current access to the LLM alone may not meet the E1 criteria. Therefore, this task falls under the E2 category as it could benefit from further software development to fully leverage the LLM's capabilities for efficient research in landscape architecture.
