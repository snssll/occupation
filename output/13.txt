1: In this task, the Residential Advisors are required to accompany and supervise students during meals. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone through an interface like ChatGPT could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality. Since the task involves physical presence and interaction with students during meals, it does not seem feasible for the LLM to directly assist in this aspect. The task does not involve writing, transforming text, providing feedback on documents, or any other text-based activities where the LLM could provide substantial assistance. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM.

2: E0
