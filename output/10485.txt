1: In this task, an Adhesive Bonding Machine Operator and Tender is required to observe gauges, meters, and control panels to gather information about equipment temperatures, pressures, or the speed of feeders or conveyors. This task involves monitoring and collecting data related to the operation of machinery. While an LLM could potentially provide information on the general concepts of monitoring equipment and interpreting gauge readings, it would not significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to physically observe and gather real-time data from the equipment. The task does not involve writing, transforming text, summarizing documents, or any other text-based activities that an LLM could directly assist with. Therefore, the task does not fall under E1. Additionally, developing software on top of the LLM to automate the physical observation of equipment and data collection in a real-world setting would be complex and not straightforward, making it unlikely to reduce the time by half. Hence, it does not fit under E2. The task also does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images, so it does not fall under E3.
