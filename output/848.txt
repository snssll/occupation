1: In this task, a Highway Maintenance Worker is required to apply poisons along roadsides and in animal burrows to eliminate unwanted vegetation and rodents. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves a physical aspect of applying poisons, which cannot be directly performed by an LLM or any software tool. Additionally, it requires on-site presence and handling of toxic substances, which cannot be replaced by text-based tools or automation. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not involve activities that can be significantly aided by an LLM or any software tool.
