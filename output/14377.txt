1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of removing excess grout or residue from tile or brick joints, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves physical work that cannot be directly performed by the LLM or any software built on top of it. The task requires manual dexterity and the ability to work with physical tools like sponges or trowels, which are beyond the capabilities of the LLM.
