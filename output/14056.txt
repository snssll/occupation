1: In this task, a Licensed Practical or Licensed Vocational Nurse is responsible for recording food and fluid intake and output for patients. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. Recording food and fluid intake and output involves documenting specific details accurately, which is a task that can be easily performed by an LLM. The LLM can assist in generating standardized forms for recording, providing guidelines on what information to include, and even flagging any inconsistencies or errors in the data input. Since this task primarily involves written documentation and data entry, the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality.
