1: The task provided involves assembling studio sets and selecting and arranging equipment for filming. This task is hands-on and requires physical presence and manipulation of equipment, which cannot be done by the LLM. The task also involves technical knowledge of camera equipment, lighting, and audio, which the LLM may not have access to unless explicitly provided in the input. Additionally, the task does not involve text input or output that the LLM can directly work with. Therefore, this task does not align with any of the exposure levels in the rubric.
