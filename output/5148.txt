1: In this task, the goal is to develop prospect lists, which involves identifying potential customers or clients for a sales or marketing campaign. This task primarily requires research skills to gather information on potential leads. With the help of the LLM, one could potentially generate a list of criteria to consider when identifying prospects, such as demographics, interests, or buying behaviors. The LLM could also assist in generating a template for organizing the prospect list. However, since this task involves a significant amount of manual research and data collection, the LLM alone may not be able to reduce the time it takes to complete the task by at least half. While the LLM could provide some guidance and templates, the bulk of the work still relies on human judgment and external data sources.
