1: In this task, an Insulation Worker, Mechanical is required to move controls, buttons, or levers to start blowers and regulate the flow of materials through nozzles. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. This task involves physical manipulation of controls and levers to operate machinery, which cannot be directly performed by an LLM. The task does not involve complex text input or output, and the context is primarily related to mechanical operations rather than information processing. Therefore, the task does not align with any of the exposure levels in the rubric as it does not involve text-based activities or tasks that can be automated by an LLM.
