1: In this task, a massage therapist is required to perform adjunctive therapies or treatment techniques in addition to massage. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes for a massage therapist to complete this task with equivalent quality.

- E0: This task involves hands-on skills and physical interaction with clients, which cannot be replaced by text-based tools like the LLM. Therefore, this task is unlikely to benefit from LLM access.
- E1: While the LLM can provide information on various adjunctive therapies or treatment techniques, the actual performance of these techniques requires physical interaction and expertise that cannot be replicated by the LLM alone. Thus, the LLM may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task.
- E2: It is conceivable that additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to provide recommendations or information on adjunctive therapies and treatment techniques, potentially streamlining the therapist's decision-making process. However, the hands-on nature of the task still limits the direct impact of the LLM on task completion time.
- E3: Image capabilities would not be relevant for this task as it does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images.
