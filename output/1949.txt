1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of cleaning and maintaining pressing machines for Pressers in the textile, garment, and related materials occupation, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it could be impacted by the use of the LLM.

- E0: This task involves physical maintenance of machinery, which cannot be directly assisted by the LLM. The task requires hands-on work with cleaning solutions and lubricants, which cannot be substituted by text-based assistance.

- E1: While the LLM could potentially provide written instructions on how to clean and maintain pressing machines, the actual physical work of using cleaning solutions and lubricants cannot be performed by the LLM. Therefore, the time it takes to complete the task would not be significantly reduced by using the LLM.

- E2: It is difficult to imagine additional software built on top of the LLM that could automate the cleaning and maintenance of pressing machines. This task is highly manual and requires physical interaction, which cannot be easily replicated by software.

- E3: The task of cleaning and maintaining pressing machines does not involve image processing or analysis, so the image capabilities of the LLM would not significantly impact the completion of this task.
