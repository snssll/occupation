1: In this task, the Veterinary Assistant or Laboratory Animal Caretaker is responsible for controlling insect pests on animals by dusting, spraying, or bathing them. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves a straightforward and manual process that does not require complex decision-making or specialized knowledge beyond basic animal care. Since the task does not involve text input or output, the LLM would not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM.
