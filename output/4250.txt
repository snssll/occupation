1: In this task, an Occupational Therapy Assistant is required to demonstrate therapy techniques, such as manual or creative arts or games. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone or with additional software could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality.

- E0: This task involves physical demonstrations of therapy techniques, which cannot be performed by the LLM or any software tool. The task requires hands-on interaction and cannot be completed solely through text-based or digital means.

- E1: The LLM could potentially provide written instructions or guidance on therapy techniques, but it cannot physically demonstrate manual techniques or creative arts. While it could offer theoretical knowledge or suggestions, the hands-on aspect of this task cannot be fully replaced by the LLM.

- E2: It is conceivable that additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to provide virtual simulations or interactive demonstrations of therapy techniques. Such software could potentially reduce the time needed to practice and demonstrate these techniques, but as of now, such tools do not exist.

- E3: The task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images, so the image capabilities of the LLM are not directly relevant to this task.

2: E0
