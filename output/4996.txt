1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of developing or conducting employee regulatory training as a Regulatory Affairs Specialist, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM could be used to generate training materials, provide information on regulatory requirements, draft training scripts, and create quizzes or assessments for employees. It can also assist in summarizing complex regulatory documents into more digestible training content. Overall, the LLM can significantly reduce the time and effort required to develop training materials and conduct training sessions.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone can handle tasks related to generating content and providing information, additional software could be developed to streamline the process further. This software could automate the creation of training modules, analyze employee performance data to tailor training content, and integrate real-time regulatory updates into the training materials. Such applications could enhance the efficiency of regulatory training development and delivery.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not directly relevant to the task of developing or conducting employee regulatory training. This task primarily involves creating written materials, conducting training sessions, and assessing employee understanding, which can be effectively supported by the text-based capabilities of the LLM.

Based on the above analysis, the task of developing or conducting employee regulatory training aligns best with the E1 label, as the LLM can directly assist in creating training materials and conducting training sessions.
