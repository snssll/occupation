1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of negotiating contracts with waste management or other firms as a Recycling Coordinator, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be impacted by the use of the LLM. 

- E0: This task involves negotiation, which typically requires human interaction, understanding of complex terms, and the ability to adapt to various situations. The negotiation process often involves non-verbal cues, tone of voice, and other factors that are not solely text-based. The LLM, even with its text generation capabilities, may not be able to fully capture the nuances of negotiation that a human can.

- E1: While the LLM can assist in drafting written correspondence related to negotiations, such as emails or proposals, the actual negotiation process itself involves real-time decision-making, strategic thinking, and interpersonal skills that go beyond text generation. The LLM may be able to provide some support in preparing for negotiations by generating potential negotiation points or strategies, but the core negotiation process is likely to remain a human task.

- E2: It is conceivable that additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to assist Recycling Coordinators in negotiating contracts. This software could potentially analyze data, provide recommendations based on market trends or previous negotiations, or even simulate negotiation scenarios for training purposes. However, the actual negotiation with waste management or other firms would still require human involvement for effective communication and decision-making.

- E3: The task of negotiating contracts with waste management or other firms does not directly involve image capabilities, so exposure to LLM with image capabilities would not significantly impact the completion of this task.
