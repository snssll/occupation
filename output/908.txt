1: In this task, a Retail Loss Prevention Specialist is required to apprehend shoplifters in accordance with guidelines. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it. 

- E0: This task involves physical intervention and real-time decision-making, which cannot be effectively replaced by the LLM. The LLM cannot physically apprehend shoplifters or make real-time judgments on the spot.

- E1: The LLM could potentially assist in providing guidelines or protocols for apprehending shoplifters, but the actual apprehension process involves physical actions and immediate decision-making that the LLM cannot perform.

- E2: While the LLM could potentially provide general guidelines or best practices for apprehending shoplifters, it cannot replace the hands-on, real-time actions required in this task. However, additional software could potentially be developed to provide real-time support or guidance based on specific scenarios.

- E3: The task does not involve image processing or detailed visual analysis that would benefit from additional image capabilities. The task is more focused on physical intervention and decision-making in real-time situations.
