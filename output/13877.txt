1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of recommending actions in fraud cases for Fraud Examiners, Investigators, and Analysts, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The task involves analyzing information related to fraud cases and making recommendations based on that analysis. The LLM can assist in this process by providing insights, generating potential actions, and helping to evaluate different scenarios based on the information provided. The LLM can process text input, understand complex instructions, and generate text output, which aligns with the task requirements. Therefore, using the LLM directly can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone can handle the task effectively, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to enhance its capabilities further. For example, specialized fraud detection algorithms or tools that can analyze financial data in conjunction with the LLM could be developed to provide more comprehensive recommendations in fraud cases. However, the task can still be efficiently completed with just the LLM.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not relevant for this task as it primarily involves analyzing text-based information related to fraud cases and making recommendations based on that analysis.

Based on the above analysis, the most appropriate label for this task is E1: Direct exposure.

2: E1

3: High certainty
