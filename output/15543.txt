1: In this task, a technical writer is required to select photographs, drawings, sketches, diagrams, and charts to illustrate material. This task involves visual content selection based on the written material. While the LLM can assist in generating text-based content, it does not have the capability to view, select, or create images. Therefore, this task does not directly benefit from the LLM's text-based capabilities. Additionally, the task does not involve complex decision-making or specialized domain knowledge that the LLM could provide. As a result, this task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM or any tools built on top of it.

2: E0
