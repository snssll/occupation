1: In this task, the Low Vision Therapists, Orientation and Mobility Specialists, and Vision Rehabilitation Therapists are required to train clients to use various sensory information such as tactile, auditory, kinesthetic, olfactory, and proprioceptive cues. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be significantly aided by the use of text-based information processing, generation, or analysis. Since the task involves training clients using multiple sensory modalities, which are not primarily text-based, the direct use of LLM may not provide a substantial advantage in completing this task. While LLM could potentially assist in generating training materials or providing information on specific techniques related to sensory training, the core aspect of training clients to use sensory information is more hands-on and experiential, which may not be significantly enhanced by LLM.
