1: In this task, a Broadcast Technician is responsible for selecting sources from which programming will be received or through which programming will be transmitted. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone or with additional software could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality.

- E0: This task involves making decisions based on specific sources and transmission methods, which may require human judgment and expertise. The task does not involve writing or transforming text, providing edits, summarizing documents, or any other text-based activities that the LLM could directly assist with. Therefore, it is unlikely that the LLM alone or with additional software could reduce the time significantly for a Broadcast Technician to complete this task.

- E1: The task does not involve writing, editing, summarizing, or any other text-based activities that the LLM could directly assist with. The decision-making process for selecting sources and transmission methods is based on expertise and specific requirements, which may not be easily automated by the LLM alone. Therefore, it is unlikely that direct access to the LLM would reduce the time significantly for a Broadcast Technician to complete this task.

- E2: While it is conceivable that additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to assist Broadcast Technicians in analyzing data, making recommendations, or retrieving specialized domain knowledge related to sources and transmission methods, the task itself does not directly align with the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves practical considerations and technical expertise that may not be easily automated by the LLM alone.

- E3: The task does not involve image capabilities, such as reading text from PDFs or creating/editing digital images, which could be enhanced by combining the LLM with image processing tools. Therefore, exposure to image capabilities would not significantly reduce the time to complete this task for a Broadcast Technician.
