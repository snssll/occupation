1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of developing and coordinating educational programs for residents as a Residential Advisor, we need to consider the level of exposure to LLM. 

- E1: Direct exposure - If the task involves writing and transforming text to create educational program materials, providing edits to existing program content, or generating questions for assessments, the LLM could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete these tasks with equivalent quality by at least half.
- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not reduce the time by half for this task, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to summarize educational content, retrieve up-to-date information for program development, or provide recommendations based on data analysis.
- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Since the task does not involve reading text from PDFs or creating/editing digital images, the image capabilities of the LLM are not relevant for this task.

Considering the nature of the task, the LLM could be used to generate educational content, provide feedback on program materials, and potentially assist in researching up-to-date information for program development. Therefore, the task aligns more closely with E1: Direct exposure.

2: E1

3: Moderate
