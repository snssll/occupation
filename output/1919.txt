1: In this task, a Highway Maintenance Worker is responsible for cleaning and clearing debris from various drain structures. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves physical work in outdoor environments, such as removing debris from culverts, catch basins, and ditches. This task does not involve complex text input or output that would benefit significantly from the use of an LLM. The task requires manual labor and physical presence at the site, which cannot be replaced by text-based interactions with an LLM. Therefore, the task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of an LLM or LLM-powered tools.

2: E0

3: High
