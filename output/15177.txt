1: In this task, a Team Assembler is required to review work orders and blueprints to ensure that the work is performed according to specifications. This task involves reading and understanding technical documents, checking for accuracy and compliance with instructions, and potentially making decisions based on the information provided. 

To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we can break down the task:
- Reading work orders and blueprints: The LLM can assist in summarizing and interpreting text, which could help in quickly understanding the content of work orders and blueprints.
- Ensuring work is performed according to specifications: The LLM can provide guidance on interpreting specifications and potentially offer suggestions on how to ensure compliance.

Given these considerations, the task could benefit from the LLM's ability to process and interpret text, which could significantly reduce the time it takes to review work orders and blueprints. Therefore, this task falls under label E1.

2: E1
