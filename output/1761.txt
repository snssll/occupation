1: In this task, a roofer is required to cement or nail flashing strips of metal or shingle over joints to ensure they are watertight. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves physical work that requires manual labor, precision in placement, and knowledge of roofing materials and techniques. It does not involve text-based inputs or outputs that can be easily processed by an LLM. The task also requires physical interaction with roofing materials and structures, which cannot be replicated by an LLM. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of an LLM or any tools built on top of it.
