1: In this task for Surgical Assistants, the main responsibility is to coordinate or participate in positioning patients for surgical procedures. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes for a Surgical Assistant to complete this task with high quality. Since this task involves physical interaction with patients, precise positioning, and ensuring patient safety, it is unlikely that the LLM or any tools built on top of it can effectively assist in completing this task. The task requires hands-on skills, physical assessment, and real-time decision-making based on patient conditions, which cannot be replaced by text-based AI models.
