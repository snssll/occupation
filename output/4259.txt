1: In this task, a Tire Builder is required to depress pedals to rotate drums and wind specified numbers of plies around drums to form tire bodies. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves physical actions such as depressing pedals and winding plies around drums, which cannot be directly performed by an LLM. Additionally, the task does not involve complex text input or output, specialized domain knowledge, or the need for up-to-date facts. Therefore, the task does not align with any of the exposure levels in the rubric.

2: E0
