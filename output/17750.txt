1: In this task, an Inspector, Tester, Sorter, Sampler, or Weigher is required to weigh materials, products, containers, or samples to verify packaging weights or ingredient quantities. This task involves physical weighing of items to ensure accuracy. The task does not involve text input or output, and the main action is the physical act of weighing. While an LLM could potentially provide information on standard weights or guidelines, it cannot physically weigh items. Therefore, there is no direct exposure of the task to LLM capabilities as the task is inherently physical and cannot be completed using text input or output alone.
