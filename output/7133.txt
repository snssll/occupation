- The LLM can help in drafting requests for specific financial documents, ensuring clarity and precision in the language used.
- It can provide templates for organizing and categorizing the gathered financial documents efficiently.
- The LLM can assist in summarizing the content of the financial documents, highlighting key information for the investigator's analysis.
