1: In this task, a Clinical Research Coordinator is responsible for developing advertising and informational materials to recruit subjects for research studies. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- E0: This task involves creativity, understanding of research protocols, and the ability to tailor materials to attract specific subjects. It does not involve direct text-based tasks that can be significantly expedited by an LLM. The task also does not involve detailed image processing or analysis that would benefit from image capabilities alongside the LLM. Therefore, it does not fit into any of the exposure categories.

- E1: While an LLM could potentially assist in generating text for advertising materials, the task of developing these materials requires more than just text generation. It involves understanding the target audience, compliance with regulations, and creativity in crafting compelling messages. The LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality by at least half.

- E2: It is conceivable that additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to assist in summarizing research protocols, regulations, and other relevant information to streamline the development of advertising and informational materials. This software could potentially retrieve up-to-date information on recruitment strategies and regulations, making the process more efficient. However, the task itself is not solely text-based, and the potential software would need to integrate various sources of information beyond what the LLM can provide alone.

- E3: The task does not involve image processing, reading text from PDFs, or creating/editing digital images, so the image capabilities of the LLM are not relevant in this context.
