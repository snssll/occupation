1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of providing technical support to other employees regarding mechanical design, fabrication, testing, or documentation as a Mechanical Engineering Technologist or Technician, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. In this task, the LLM could potentially assist in generating technical documentation, providing explanations or summaries of mechanical design concepts, or even offering troubleshooting advice based on general mechanical engineering knowledge. The LLM could also help in drafting emails or reports related to technical support. However, since this task involves a level of technical expertise and hands-on support that may require real-time interaction or physical demonstrations, the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with high quality.
