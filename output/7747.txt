1: In this task, a Rock Splitter in a quarry inserts wedges and feathers into holes and drives wedges with sledgehammers to split stone sections from masses. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it. 

- E0: This task involves physical labor and requires manual dexterity to insert wedges and feathers into holes and use a sledgehammer to split stone sections. The task does not involve text-based instructions or information processing that could be significantly aided by the LLM. Therefore, this task does not benefit from LLM exposure.

- E1: The task does not involve writing, transforming text, providing edits, translating languages, summarizing documents, answering questions, generating questions, writing emails, maintaining records, or preparing training materials. The task is purely physical and does not align with the capabilities of the LLM to reduce the time it takes to complete the task.

- E2: While it is conceivable that specialized software could be developed to assist with tasks in a quarry setting, such as analyzing geological data or optimizing rock splitting techniques, the specific task of physically inserting wedges and feathers and using a sledgehammer is not directly related to text-based information processing or analysis that the LLM excels at. Therefore, the task does not fit into this category either.

- E3: The task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images. The task is purely physical and does not require image capabilities for completion.

2: E0

3: High certainty
