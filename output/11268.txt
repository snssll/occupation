1: In this task, a farmworker is required to participate in various activities related to the inspection, grading, sorting, storage, and post-harvest treatment of crops. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes for a farmworker to complete these tasks with high quality. 

- The task involves physical activities such as handling crops, which cannot be directly assisted by the LLM.
- The knowledge and skills required for crop inspection, grading, sorting, and treatment are practical and hands-on, not primarily based on text or data analysis.
- The task does not involve complex decision-making that can be automated by the LLM.
- The LLM does not have the capability to physically inspect or treat crops.

Based on these considerations, it is evident that the task of participating in the inspection, grading, sorting, storage, and post-harvest treatment of crops does not align with any of the exposure labels (E0, E1, E2, E3) provided.

2: E0

3: High
