1: In this task, a Computer and Information Research Scientist is required to direct daily operations of departments and coordinate project activities with other departments. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- Direct exposure (E1): The task involves coordinating project activities and daily operations, which may require communication, decision-making, and strategic planning. While an LLM can assist in generating written communication or providing information, it may not significantly reduce the time it takes to coordinate and manage departmental operations.

- Exposure by LLM-powered applications (E2): Although an LLM could potentially assist in generating reports, analyzing data, or providing recommendations based on information provided, the task of directing daily operations and coordinating project activities involves a high level of human interaction, decision-making, and strategic planning that may not be significantly expedited by the use of an LLM alone.

- Exposure given image capabilities (E3): Image capabilities would not be relevant for this task as it primarily involves coordinating project activities and daily operations of departments, which are text-based activities.

Based on the analysis, the task of directing daily operations of departments and coordinating project activities with other departments is best classified as E2 - Exposure by LLM-powered applications.
