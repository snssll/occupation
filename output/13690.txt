1: In this task, an elementary school teacher reads books to entire classes or small groups of students. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes for an elementary school teacher to complete this task with equivalent quality. 

- E0: This task involves direct human interaction and reading aloud to students, which cannot be replaced by the LLM. The LLM cannot physically read books to students or engage in the interactive and educational aspects of storytelling that a human teacher provides. Therefore, this task is not suitable for automation using the LLM.
- E1: While the LLM could potentially generate summaries or analyses of books that the teacher could use as a resource, the core task of reading books to students cannot be directly automated by the LLM. The interactive and educational elements of reading aloud to students require human presence and engagement.
- E2: It is conceivable that additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to provide supplementary materials or resources related to the books being read, such as summaries, discussion questions, or educational activities. However, the core task of reading books to students would still require human involvement.
- E3: The task of reading books to students does not involve image processing or detailed visual tasks that would benefit from additional image capabilities. Therefore, this task does not fall under E3.
