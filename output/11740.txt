1: In this task, a Bill and Account Collector is required to perform various administrative functions for assigned accounts, such as recording address changes and purging the records of deceased customers. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves administrative functions that are primarily text-based, such as recording address changes and updating customer records. This can be effectively handled by an LLM through text input and output.
- The task does not require specialized domain knowledge beyond general administrative procedures, which means the LLM can handle the task without the need for highly specialized information retrieval.
- The task does not involve detailed visuals or precise measurements, ruling out the need for image capabilities.
- The task does not involve human interaction or physical actions, making it suitable for automation through text-based processing.

Based on these considerations, the task of performing administrative functions for assigned accounts aligns with the capabilities of an LLM, which can efficiently handle text-based tasks like data entry, record-keeping, and administrative functions.
