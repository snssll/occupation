1: In this task of training and rehearsing animals for performances, the main focus is on working with animals to ensure they perform specific behaviors or tricks according to scripts. This task does not involve text-based work that can be easily automated by an LLM. The training process requires physical interaction with animals, observation of their behavior, and hands-on training techniques that cannot be replicated by an LLM. Additionally, the task involves real-time adjustments based on animal behavior, which requires immediate feedback and physical presence. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not involve text-based work that can be automated by an LLM.
