1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of determining the sequence of machine operations and selecting cutting tools for machining workpieces, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves a high level of technical knowledge and expertise in machining processes, tool selection, and operational sequences. While the LLM can provide information on general machining processes and tool selection, it may not have the specialized domain knowledge required for CNC tool programming. The task also involves practical considerations such as machine specifications, material properties, and precision requirements, which may not be within the scope of the LLM's capabilities. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it requires specialized domain knowledge and practical experience that the LLM alone may not possess.

2: E0

3: High
