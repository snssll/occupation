1: In this task, a First-Line Supervisor of Food Preparation and Serving Workers is responsible for supervising and participating in kitchen and dining area cleaning activities. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone or with additional software could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality.

- E0: This task involves physical activities such as cleaning, which cannot be directly assisted by the LLM or any software tools. Therefore, this task does not fit into the E0 category.
- E1: The task involves supervising and participating in cleaning activities, which are practical and hands-on. While the LLM could potentially provide guidance on best practices or create written instructions for cleaning procedures, the actual cleaning work cannot be automated or significantly assisted by the LLM. Thus, the task cannot be completed in half the time with equivalent quality using the LLM alone. Therefore, this task does not fit into the E1 category.
- E2: While the LLM could potentially assist in creating training materials or documentation related to cleaning procedures, it cannot directly reduce the time it takes to supervise and participate in cleaning activities. However, it is conceivable that additional software could be developed to streamline the documentation process or provide real-time guidance on cleaning tasks, which could potentially reduce the time needed to complete the task. Therefore, this task aligns more closely with the E2 category.
- E3: The task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images, so it does not fall under the E3 category.

2: E2
