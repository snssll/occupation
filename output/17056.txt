1: In this task, the helper production worker is responsible for tying products in bundles according to specific procedures. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the complexity of the task and whether the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete it with equivalent quality.

- The task involves following prescribed procedures, which may not require complex decision-making or specialized knowledge beyond what is already known by an average worker in this role.
- The task is primarily manual and physical, involving tying products in bundles, which cannot be directly assisted by the LLM.
- While the LLM could potentially provide written instructions or guidance on how to tie products in bundles, the actual physical act of tying the products cannot be automated by the LLM.
- The task does not involve complex data analysis, specialized domain knowledge, or the need for up-to-date information that the LLM could provide.

Based on these considerations, the task of tying products in bundles for further processing or shipment would likely fall under E0 as the LLM or LLM-powered tools would not significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete the task with high quality.
