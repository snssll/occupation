1: In this task, a Freight Forwarder is responsible for coordinating the transportation and storage of goods to their destinations. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone or with additional software could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task.

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM could assist in generating emails, summarizing documents related to shipping regulations, providing feedback on transportation plans, or even drafting storage agreements. It could also help in writing reports or communicating with clients. However, the core task of physically arranging the delivery or storage of goods would still require human intervention and coordination beyond what the LLM can provide.
- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM could potentially assist in summarizing complex shipping regulations, analyzing data related to transportation costs, or even suggesting optimal routes based on historical data, the task of physically arranging the delivery or storage of goods would still heavily rely on human decision-making and coordination.
- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities would not significantly impact the task of arranging delivery or storage of goods, as this task is primarily focused on logistics and coordination rather than visual information.

Based on the analysis, the task of arranging delivery or storage of goods at destinations would likely fall under **E0: No exposure** as the core aspects of the task involve physical coordination and decision-making that cannot be significantly aided by the LLM alone or with additional software.
