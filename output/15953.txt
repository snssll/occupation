1: In this task, a Postal Service Mail Carrier is required to sign for cash-on-delivery and registered mail before leaving the post office. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we can break down the task:
- The task involves a simple and routine action of signing for specific types of mail.
- The task does not require complex decision-making, critical thinking, or specialized knowledge beyond the standard procedures followed by mail carriers.
- The task does not involve any in-depth analysis, research, or creative input.
- The task is primarily a procedural step in the mail delivery process.

Based on these considerations, it is evident that this task falls under the category of E0. The task does not involve any complexities that would benefit significantly from the use of an LLM or any additional software beyond standard procedures.
