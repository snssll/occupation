1: In this task, the Crushing, Grinding, and Polishing Machine Setters, Operators, and Tenders need to read work orders to determine production specifications and information. This task involves understanding written instructions and extracting relevant details from the work orders. An LLM could potentially assist by summarizing the work orders, highlighting key information, or even generating questions based on the content of the work orders. The LLM could also help in clarifying any ambiguous instructions or providing additional context if needed. However, since this task primarily involves reading and interpreting text, the LLM's direct impact may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task.
