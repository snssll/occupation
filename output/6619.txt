1: In this task, the helper-electrician is required to examine electrical units for loose connections and broken insulation, and then tighten connections using hand tools. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves physical inspection of electrical units, identifying issues such as loose connections and broken insulation, and then performing manual work to tighten connections. This task does not involve writing, summarizing, translating, or any other text-based activities that could benefit significantly from the use of an LLM. The task is hands-on and requires physical presence and manual dexterity, which cannot be replaced by an LLM. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM or any tools built on top of it.
