1: In this task, a Maids and Housekeeping Cleaners worker is required to observe precautions to protect hotel and guest property and report any issues like damage, theft, or found articles to supervisors. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we can break down the task:
- Writing and transforming text: The task involves reporting incidents to supervisors, which could potentially be aided by the LLM in drafting accurate and detailed reports.
- Providing feedback on documents: The worker may need to provide feedback on incident reports or documentation related to property protection.
- Informing others of information: The worker needs to inform supervisors about specific incidents or issues.

Considering these aspects, the task could benefit from the LLM's assistance in drafting reports, providing feedback, and communicating information effectively.
