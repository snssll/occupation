1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of preparing briefs, legal memoranda, or statements of issues involved in cases as a Judicial Law Clerk, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could assist in completing it. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The task involves writing legal documents such as briefs and legal memoranda, which can benefit from the LLM's ability to generate text based on complex instructions. The LLM can assist in drafting these documents, providing suggestions, and recommendations based on the input provided. Therefore, the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the task may not require additional software beyond the LLM itself, it is easy to imagine specialized software that could be developed on top of the LLM to further streamline the process of preparing legal documents. This software could provide more tailored recommendations, analyze legal precedents, or offer insights based on specific case details.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not relevant for the task of preparing legal documents, as it primarily involves text-based work rather than image processing.
