1: In this task of preparing a training budget for a department or organization, the use of the LLM could potentially fall under E1 exposure. The LLM can assist in generating text and calculations related to budget preparation based on the input provided. It can help in outlining the budget components, estimating costs, and providing detailed explanations for each item. The model can also assist in summarizing data, analyzing trends, and making recommendations based on the information provided. However, since budget preparation may involve specific financial knowledge and expertise, the LLM alone may not be able to significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task by half. Therefore, it does not qualify for E2 exposure, which requires the potential for additional software development to achieve a significant time reduction. The task does not involve image capabilities, so it does not fall under E3 exposure.
