1: In this task, a Career/Technical Education Teacher at the secondary school level is responsible for preparing materials and the classroom for class activities. This involves organizing and setting up equipment, tools, and resources needed for hands-on activities, demonstrations, or projects related to the specific career or technical subject being taught. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be significantly expedited or improved by using the language model. 

- E0: This task involves physical setup and organization of the classroom, which does not directly benefit from the text-based capabilities of the LLM. The LLM cannot physically set up the classroom or handle physical materials, so it does not reduce the time significantly for an experienced worker to complete this task.

- E1: While the LLM could potentially provide written instructions or guidance on how to prepare materials or suggest activities, the direct text-based assistance may not significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced teacher to physically set up the classroom and materials. The task is more about physical organization rather than text-based work.

- E2: It is conceivable that additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to help generate detailed lesson plans, activity ideas, or instructional materials tailored to specific career/technical subjects. This software could potentially streamline the preparation process by providing ready-made resources or suggestions based on the subject matter. However, the direct impact of the LLM alone on preparing the classroom for activities may not be as significant.

- E3: The task of preparing materials and the classroom for class activities does not involve image processing or creation that would benefit from the image capabilities of the LLM. Therefore, exposure to image capabilities does not significantly impact the completion of this task.
