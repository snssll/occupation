1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of coordinating and implementing quality control objectives as an Industrial Engineer, we need to consider the level of exposure to LLM.

- E1: Direct exposure - The task involves writing and transforming text to coordinate and implement quality control objectives. The LLM can assist in generating ideas, drafting procedures, and providing insights on resolving production problems, maximizing product reliability, or minimizing costs. The model can help in creating detailed plans and strategies based on the input provided.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the task may not be directly reducible to half the time with just the LLM, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to streamline the process. For instance, specialized software could be created to analyze production data, recommend specific quality control measures, or suggest cost-saving strategies based on the LLM's capabilities.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not relevant for this task as it primarily involves coordinating and implementing quality control objectives through text-based instructions and strategies.

Based on the above analysis, the task of coordinating and implementing quality control objectives as an Industrial Engineer falls under E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications.
