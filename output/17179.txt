1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of training people in computer system use as a Network and Computer Systems Administrator, we need to consider how the task can be completed with the help of an LLM. 

- E1: Direct exposure - If the task involves creating training materials, providing instructions, or answering questions related to computer system use, the LLM can assist in writing and transforming text according to complex instructions, preparing training materials based on general knowledge, and informing individuals of information via written or spoken medium. The LLM can help in generating content for training sessions, manuals, or presentations, thereby reducing the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While an LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time it takes to train people in computer system use, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to provide interactive training modules, personalized learning experiences, or real-time troubleshooting assistance. Such software could enhance the training process and make it more efficient, potentially reducing the time required to train individuals.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not directly relevant to the task of training people in computer system use. Reading text from PDFs or scanning images is not a primary requirement for this task, and creating or editing digital images is unlikely to significantly impact the training process.

Based on the above analysis, the task of training people in computer system use as a Network and Computer Systems Administrator is best classified as E1: Direct exposure.

2: E1

3: High
