1: In this task, an Aircraft Mechanic and Service Technician is required to trim and shape replacement body sections to specified sizes, fit them, and secure them in place using various tools. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be significantly aided by the use of the language model. Since this task involves physical work such as using hand tools and power tools, it does not directly involve text-based activities that the LLM excels at. The task also requires practical skills and knowledge of aircraft mechanics, which are not primarily text-based. Therefore, the task does not align with the capabilities of the LLM, and there is no clear way for the model to reduce the time it takes to complete this task.
