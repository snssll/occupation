1: In this task, the helper-production worker is responsible for washing work areas, machines, equipment, vehicles, or products. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves physical actions such as washing, which cannot be directly performed by an LLM. The task does not involve complex decision-making, specialized knowledge, or extensive data analysis that would benefit significantly from LLM capabilities. Therefore, this task does not align with any of the exposure labels related to LLM capabilities.
