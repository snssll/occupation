1: In this task, a First-Line Supervisor of Housekeeping and Janitorial Workers is responsible for issuing supplies and equipment to workers. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone or with additional software could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality.

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM could potentially assist in generating lists of supplies and equipment needed based on the number of workers, types of tasks, and inventory levels. It could also help in creating a system for tracking issued supplies. The LLM could provide text-based instructions or checklists for the supervisor to follow when issuing supplies. Overall, the LLM could streamline the process of issuing supplies and equipment to workers by providing guidance and automating certain aspects of the task.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not reduce the time it takes to complete this task by half, additional software built on top of the LLM could enhance the process further. For example, a specialized application could integrate with inventory management systems to automatically generate supply lists based on predefined criteria. It could also provide real-time updates on inventory levels and suggest optimal quantities to issue. Such software could significantly improve efficiency and accuracy in issuing supplies and equipment to workers.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities would not have a significant impact on issuing supplies and equipment to workers in this context. This task primarily involves text-based instructions and inventory management, which can be effectively handled by the LLM without the need for image processing.
