1: In this task of processing merchandise returns and exchanges as a cashier, the main activities involve interacting with customers, handling transactions, checking the condition of returned items, and ensuring proper documentation. The task does not involve complex decision-making or specialized domain knowledge beyond basic retail operations. 

Considering the exposure rubric:
- E1: Direct access to the LLM could potentially assist in providing scripted responses for common return scenarios, generating return labels, or drafting return policies. The LLM could also help in drafting communication materials related to returns.
- E2: While additional software could potentially be developed to automate some aspects of return processing, such as scanning barcodes to identify items or automatically updating inventory systems, the task itself does not inherently require advanced capabilities beyond what a typical cashier would handle.
- E3: Image capabilities are not relevant for this task as it primarily involves text-based interactions and handling physical merchandise.
