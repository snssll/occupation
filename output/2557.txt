1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of comparing data with source documents or re-entering data in verification format to detect errors for Data Entry Keyers, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could assist in completing it. 

- Data entry tasks involve comparing and verifying information, which can be time-consuming and prone to errors if done manually.
- The LLM could potentially assist by automating parts of the data comparison process, flagging potential errors, or even suggesting corrections based on patterns in the data.
- The LLM could also help in quickly retrieving information or guidelines on data entry best practices to ensure accuracy.
- While the task itself is straightforward and doesn't require specialized domain knowledge, the LLM's ability to process and analyze text could significantly speed up the verification process.

Considering these points, the task of comparing data with source documents or re-entering data in verification format to detect errors for Data Entry Keyers could be classified as E1 - Direct exposure.

2: E1

3: Moderate
