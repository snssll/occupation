1: In this task, a Self-Enrichment Teacher is required to meet with other instructors to discuss individual students and their progress. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if the task can be significantly expedited or improved by using the LLM. 

- E0: This task involves direct human interaction and discussion among instructors. The nuances of student progress and individualized discussions may require a level of human understanding and empathy that an LLM may not be able to replicate effectively. Additionally, the task does not involve written text or data processing that could be streamlined by the LLM.

- E1: While the LLM could potentially assist in generating meeting agendas, summarizing student progress reports, or drafting follow-up emails, the core aspect of the task, which is the discussion among instructors, heavily relies on human interaction and understanding. The LLM may not significantly reduce the time or improve the quality of these discussions.

- E2: It is conceivable that software could be developed to assist Self-Enrichment Teachers by summarizing student progress data, providing insights or recommendations based on student performance trends, or even scheduling meetings efficiently. However, the core aspect of discussing individual students and their progress with other instructors may still require human judgment and interaction.

- E3: The task does not involve image processing or analysis, so the image capabilities of the LLM are not relevant in this context.
