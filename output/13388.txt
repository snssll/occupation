1: In this task, a Costume Attendant is responsible for providing budget recommendations to managers and overseeing budgetary line items related to costumes, storage, or makeup needs. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves analyzing budgetary requirements, making recommendations based on those analyses, and managing budget-related aspects of costume, storage, and makeup needs. These activities primarily involve text-based analysis, decision-making, and communication of recommendations. An LLM could assist in generating budget recommendations based on provided data, analyzing budgetary line items, and potentially even drafting communication to managers regarding budget needs. While the LLM may not directly reduce the time it takes to complete the task by half, it could significantly streamline the process by providing insights, generating recommendations, and aiding in communication related to budgetary matters.
