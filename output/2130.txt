1: In this task of cleaning, lubricating, or maintaining equipment in a power plant, the process involves physical actions such as cleaning machinery, applying lubricants, and conducting routine maintenance checks. These actions require hands-on work and direct interaction with the equipment. The task does not involve complex decision-making, analysis, or interpretation that could be effectively handled by an LLM. Since the task is primarily manual and does not involve text-based instructions or data analysis that could benefit from LLM capabilities, it is clear that the exposure to LLM is minimal. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM.
