1: In this task, an Advertising Sales Agent is required to identify new advertising markets and propose products to serve them. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we can break down the task:
- Identifying new advertising markets: The LLM can assist in researching and providing information on potential new advertising markets based on existing data and trends. This involves text-based research and analysis, which falls within the capabilities of the LLM.
- Proposing products to serve new markets: The LLM can generate ideas for products based on input criteria and market research. It can provide text-based suggestions and recommendations for products tailored to specific markets.

Considering the task involves text-based research, analysis, and idea generation, it falls under E1 as the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality.
