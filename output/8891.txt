1: In this task, a Heavy and Tractor-Trailer Truck Driver is required to load or unload trucks, using special loading-related equipment or other necessary equipment. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality. Since this task involves physical labor, manual handling of equipment, and coordination with others, it is unlikely that the LLM or any tool built on top of it can effectively assist in completing the task. The task requires physical presence, practical skills, and real-time decision-making, which cannot be replicated by the LLM.
