1: For the task of processing and preparing documents like business or government forms and expense reports as an Office Clerk, General, the exposure to LLM can be evaluated as follows:

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** The task involves working with text-based documents, which can be easily handled by the LLM. The model can assist in writing, editing, summarizing, and providing feedback on documents. It can also help in maintaining records of written data and preparing training materials based on general knowledge. Therefore, direct access to the LLM through an interface like ChatGPT could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the task is straightforward and text-based, it may not require additional software beyond the LLM itself to complete it efficiently. The LLM can handle the text processing and document preparation aspects effectively without the need for specialized applications.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Since the task specifically involves processing and preparing text-based documents like forms and reports, there is no need for image capabilities in this scenario. The task does not require reading text from PDFs or scanning images, making E3 less relevant.
