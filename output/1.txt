1: In this task, a Mail Clerk is responsible for accepting and checking containers of mail or parcels from various sources. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves receiving and inspecting physical containers of mail or parcels, which requires physical interaction and verification. This task does not involve writing, summarizing, analyzing text, or any other activity that can be directly facilitated by an LLM. The LLM cannot physically handle or inspect physical containers, so it cannot directly assist in this task. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM.
