1: In this task, a school psychologist is responsible for maintaining various student records, including special education reports, confidential records, records of services provided, and behavioral data. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM can assist in completing it. 

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** The LLM can be used to assist in maintaining student records by generating reports, summarizing data, organizing information, and potentially even identifying patterns in behavioral data. The model can help in writing and transforming text related to student records, providing edits to existing records, and summarizing information. It can also assist in generating questions or feedback based on the records provided. Overall, the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to maintain student records with equivalent quality by at least half.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the LLM alone can be helpful in completing this task, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to further enhance its capabilities. For example, specialized software could be created to retrieve specific information from the records, analyze trends in behavioral data, or provide recommendations based on the data. This additional software could streamline the process even further, although the LLM itself is already quite beneficial for this task.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Image capabilities are not directly relevant to maintaining student records, as this task primarily involves text-based information. Therefore, image capabilities would not significantly impact the completion of this task.

Based on the above analysis, the most appropriate exposure label for this task is **E1 (Direct exposure)**.
