1: In this task, an Advertising and Promotions Manager is required to prepare budgets and submit estimates for program costs as part of campaign plan development. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves working with financial data, analyzing costs, and preparing estimates, which are activities that can be supported by the LLM through text input and output.
- The LLM can assist in generating budget proposals, providing insights on cost trends, and suggesting strategies to optimize budget allocation.
- While the task may involve some level of domain-specific knowledge related to advertising and promotions, the core activity of budget preparation and cost estimation can be facilitated by the LLM's text processing capabilities.

Based on these considerations, the task can be categorized as E1 - Direct exposure, as the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality by providing support in writing and transforming text related to budget preparation and cost estimation.
