1: In this task, a Hearing Aid Specialist administers basic hearing tests, including air conduction, bone conduction, or speech audiometry tests. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes for a Hearing Aid Specialist to administer these tests with equivalent quality.

- E0: This task involves hands-on, specialized skills that require physical interaction with patients. The LLM cannot physically administer tests or interact with patients, so it cannot directly reduce the time it takes to complete this task.
- E1: The LLM could potentially provide information on the latest techniques or guidelines for administering hearing tests, which could assist the specialist in staying up-to-date. However, the actual administration of the tests requires physical presence and specialized equipment, which the LLM cannot replace.
- E2: While the LLM could potentially summarize research articles or guidelines related to hearing tests, it cannot directly administer the tests. However, a specialized software tool could be developed on top of the LLM to provide quick access to relevant information or guidelines, which might aid the specialist in preparing for the tests.
- E3: The task does not involve image processing or analysis, so the image capabilities of the LLM are not directly relevant to administering hearing tests.

Based on the above analysis, the most appropriate label for this task is E2.

2: E2

3: Moderate
