1: In this task, a welder, cutter, solderer, or brazer is required to hammer out bulges or bends in metal workpieces. This task involves physical manipulation of metal objects, requiring manual dexterity and knowledge of metalworking techniques. The task does not involve text input or output, and the context is primarily related to hands-on skills rather than written information. As such, there is no direct application of the LLM in completing this task. Additionally, developing software on top of the LLM to assist with physical metalworking tasks is not feasible. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not benefit from LLM exposure.

2: E0

3: High
