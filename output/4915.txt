1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of developing information security standards and best practices as an Information Security Engineer, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be aided by the use of a large language model (LLM).

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** Using an LLM directly could significantly reduce the time it takes to develop information security standards and best practices. The LLM can assist in researching the latest trends, regulations, and best practices in the field of information security, providing insights, generating drafts, and even helping in the documentation process. The task involves writing and transforming text according to complex instructions, which aligns well with the capabilities of an LLM.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While an LLM alone may not reduce the time by half for this task, additional software built on top of the LLM could enhance the process. For example, specialized tools could be developed to summarize extensive documents on information security, retrieve up-to-date facts from the internet, or provide recommendations based on data analysis. These tools could further streamline the development of security standards and best practices.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Image capabilities are not directly relevant to the task of developing information security standards and best practices. This task primarily involves text-based research, analysis, and documentation, which can be effectively handled by an LLM without the need for image capabilities.

Considering the above points, the task of developing information security standards and best practices aligns most closely with **E1 (Direct exposure)** as an LLM can significantly aid in the research, drafting, and documentation aspects of the task.
