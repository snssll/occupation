1: In this task, a Business Continuity Planner is required to identify individual or transaction targets to direct intelligence collection. To complete this task, the planner would need to analyze various factors, such as potential risks, critical functions, dependencies, and vulnerabilities within an organization. They would also need to consider external threats and potential scenarios that could disrupt business operations. The planner would then prioritize targets based on their criticality and potential impact on the organization.

When considering the exposure rubric, this task falls under the domain of business continuity planning, which involves a high level of expertise and specialized knowledge. While the LLM can provide general information on business continuity planning, it may not have access to specific organizational data or intelligence required to identify individual or transaction targets accurately. Additionally, this task involves making strategic decisions based on complex factors that may not be easily captured by the LLM alone. Therefore, the task is best classified as E0, as the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced Business Continuity Planner to complete this task with high quality.
