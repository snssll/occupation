1: In this task, a fundraiser is responsible for directly or supervising fundraising staff, including volunteers. To complete this task, the fundraiser needs to provide guidance, instructions, and feedback to the staff members, ensuring they are effectively carrying out fundraising activities. With the help of a large language model (LLM), the fundraiser could potentially streamline communication by generating detailed instructions, feedback, and guidance for the fundraising staff. The LLM could assist in crafting clear and concise messages, providing training materials, and even generating fundraising strategies based on general knowledge. Overall, the LLM could significantly reduce the time it takes to communicate with and supervise fundraising staff, improving efficiency in managing the fundraising team.
