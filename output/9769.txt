1: In this task, a Property, Real Estate, and Community Association Manager is required to meet with prospective tenants to show properties, explain terms of occupancy, and provide information about local areas. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The LLM can assist in tasks related to writing, summarizing, providing information, and answering questions. However, in this specific task, the core requirement involves in-person interaction with prospective tenants, showing properties, and explaining terms face-to-face. While the LLM could potentially help in preparing information sheets or scripts for these meetings, it cannot replace the need for physical presence and direct interaction with prospective tenants. Therefore, the task does not significantly benefit from the capabilities of the LLM, and it falls under E0.
