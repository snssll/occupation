1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of applying glazes, icings, or other toppings to baked goods as a Baker, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. In this task, the main actions involve physical manipulation of food items, which cannot be directly assisted by the LLM. The LLM cannot perform tasks that require physical interaction, such as using spatulas or brushes to apply toppings. Additionally, this task does not involve complex written or spoken communication that the LLM could assist with. Therefore, the task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM or any tools built on top of it.
