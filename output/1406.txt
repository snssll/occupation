1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of attending conferences and reading scientific literature as a Geneticist, we need to consider how the LLM can assist in this task. 

- Direct exposure (E1): The LLM can help summarize scientific literature, provide insights into technological advances, and generate questions for further research based on the information provided. It can also assist in drafting reports or notes from conferences. Therefore, the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to stay updated on genetic research findings and technological advances.

- Exposure by LLM-powered applications (E2): While the LLM alone can provide valuable assistance in summarizing and generating insights, additional software could be developed to automatically scan and summarize large volumes of scientific literature, highlight key findings, and even suggest relevant conferences to attend based on the latest research trends. This additional software could further streamline the process of staying informed in the field of genetics.

- Exposure given image capabilities (E3): Image capabilities are not directly relevant to the task of attending conferences and reading scientific literature in the field of genetics. 

Considering the above points, the task of attending conferences and reading scientific literature as a Geneticist aligns best with Exposure by LLM-powered applications (E2).
