1: In this task, a Fence Erector is required to blast rock formations and rocky areas with dynamite to make it easier to dig postholes for erecting fences. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. This task involves physical work that cannot be automated or completed by a language model. It requires specialized skills, knowledge of safety protocols, and physical handling of explosives, which are beyond the capabilities of an LLM. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it cannot be significantly aided by the use of an LLM.
