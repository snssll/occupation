1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of connecting water heaters and storage tanks to power and water sources as a Solar Thermal Installer and Technician, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it.

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** If the task involves complex instructions, such as specific technical details or troubleshooting steps, the LLM could assist in providing guidance on how to connect the water heaters and storage tanks correctly. The LLM could generate text-based instructions, troubleshoot common issues, or provide detailed explanations on the process.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the task itself may not be significantly reduced in time by just using the LLM, it is conceivable that additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to create interactive guides, virtual simulations, or augmented reality tools that could streamline the process of connecting water heaters and storage tanks.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Since the task involves physical connections and installations, having image capabilities could potentially aid in visualizing the setup process. The LLM, in combination with image capabilities, could provide annotated diagrams, step-by-step visual instructions, or even virtual models to assist in the installation process.
