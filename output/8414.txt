1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of interviewing claimants, agents, or witnesses as an Arbitrator, Mediator, or Conciliator, we need to consider the nature of the task and how an LLM could assist in completing it. 

- E1: Direct exposure - In this case, the LLM could potentially assist in preparing questions for the interviews based on general knowledge or specific information provided. It could also help in refining the questions based on the context of the dispute. Additionally, the LLM could aid in summarizing information obtained from interviews. Overall, the LLM could significantly reduce the time and effort required to prepare for and conduct interviews.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone could assist in generating questions and summarizing information, additional software could be developed to enhance the process further. For example, specialized tools could be created to analyze the responses from interviews, provide recommendations based on the data collected, or even assist in maintaining records of the interview process. These additional capabilities could further streamline the work of Arbitrators, Mediators, and Conciliators.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities would not significantly impact the task of interviewing claimants, agents, or witnesses in this context. The task primarily involves verbal communication and information gathering, which does not heavily rely on image processing.

Based on the above analysis, the task of interviewing claimants, agents, or witnesses as an Arbitrator, Mediator, or Conciliator would best fit under E1: Direct exposure.
