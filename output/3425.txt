1: The task of constructing and positioning properties, sets, lighting equipment, and other equipment for audio and video production involves physical work that cannot be directly assisted by an LLM. This task requires hands-on manipulation of equipment and spaces, which is not within the capabilities of the LLM. Additionally, the task does not involve text-based inputs or outputs that the LLM could assist with. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not benefit from exposure to the LLM.
