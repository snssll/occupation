1: In this task, the occupation involves providing assistance to patrons with special needs, such as helping those with wheelchairs. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if the task can be significantly expedited or improved by using the LLM. In this case, the task involves physical assistance and direct interaction with patrons, which cannot be replaced by text-based interactions with the LLM. The task requires hands-on support and empathy, which are not within the capabilities of the LLM. Therefore, the task does not align with any of the exposure labels as it cannot be effectively completed using the LLM.
