1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of updating or troubleshooting pharmacy information databases as a pharmacist, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. 

- Pharmacists updating or troubleshooting databases involves working with text-based information and making changes or corrections as needed. The LLM can assist in providing guidance on how to update or troubleshoot specific database entries by generating text-based instructions or suggestions based on the input provided.
- The LLM can also help in summarizing complex information related to pharmacy databases, which can aid pharmacists in understanding the context of the data they are working with.
