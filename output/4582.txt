1: In this task, a Dietetic Technician is responsible for determining food and beverage costs and assisting in implementing cost control procedures. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be significantly expedited or improved by using the language model. 

- The task involves calculations related to food and beverage costs, which may require specific knowledge of pricing, quantities, and cost control procedures.
- The LLM could potentially assist in providing general information on cost control procedures, basic calculations, and possibly offer suggestions on cost-saving measures.
- However, the task also involves practical aspects such as physically assessing inventory, interacting with suppliers, and implementing procedures in a real-world setting, which the LLM cannot directly assist with.
- While the LLM can provide some information and guidance, the practical implementation and real-time decision-making aspects of this task may not be significantly expedited by the model.
