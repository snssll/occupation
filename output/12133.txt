1: In this task, the occupation involves models posing for promoting and selling merchandise or fashions during appearances, filming, or photo sessions. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes for a worker to complete the task with high quality.

- E0: This task involves physical actions such as posing, which cannot be directly assisted by the LLM. The LLM cannot physically pose as directed or strike interpretive poses.
- E1: The LLM can potentially assist in generating promotional text, scripts, or ideas for poses based on fashion trends or merchandise details. It can also help in drafting emails or written communication related to the promotions. However, the actual posing aspect cannot be directly assisted by the LLM.
- E2: While the LLM alone may not reduce the time significantly for posing, additional software could potentially be developed to provide virtual modeling simulations or generate pose suggestions based on input criteria. This software could enhance the efficiency of selecting poses for promotions.
- E3: Image capabilities could be useful in creating digital images of poses for promotions based on descriptions or instructions provided. The LLM could assist in generating text descriptions of poses that could be translated into digital images.
