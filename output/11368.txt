1: In this task, the Heavy and Tractor-Trailer Truck Drivers are required to perform basic vehicle maintenance tasks such as adding oil, fuel, or radiator fluid, performing minor repairs, or washing trucks. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM or LLM-powered tools can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality.

- E0: This task involves physical actions like adding oil, fuel, or radiator fluid, performing minor repairs, and washing trucks, which cannot be performed by the LLM or LLM-powered tools. The task also requires hands-on work and precise actions that cannot be replaced by text-based AI models.

- E1: The LLM can provide information on basic vehicle maintenance tasks, such as steps to add oil, fuel, or radiator fluid. It can also offer guidance on minor repairs based on pre-existing knowledge. However, the LLM cannot physically perform these tasks, and the hands-on nature of the work cannot be replicated through text-based instructions alone.

- E2: While it is conceivable that additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to provide interactive guides or augmented reality tools for vehicle maintenance tasks, the complexity and physical nature of the work make it challenging to significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task by half using text-based AI alone.

- E3: The task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images, so the image capabilities of the LLM are not relevant in this context.
