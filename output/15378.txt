1: In this task of searching carry-on or checked baggage for prohibited items, the primary action involves physically inspecting the bags for any prohibited items. This task requires manual dexterity, attention to detail, and knowledge of what items are considered prohibited. While an LLM could potentially provide information on what items are typically prohibited, it cannot physically search the bags. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it involves physical actions that cannot be replaced by the LLM.
