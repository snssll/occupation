1: In this task, the Food Cooking Machine Operators and Tenders are responsible for removing cooked material or products from equipment. This task involves physical actions such as opening the equipment, taking out the cooked items, and transferring them to another location. Since this task is primarily physical and hands-on, it does not involve text input or output that can be processed by an LLM. The LLM cannot physically interact with the equipment to remove the cooked material. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM or any tools built on top of it.
