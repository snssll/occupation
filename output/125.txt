1: In this task, an orthodontist is required to adjust dental appliances to produce and maintain normal function for their patients. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. Adjusting dental appliances involves a hands-on, physical interaction with patients' mouths and teeth, which cannot be performed by an LLM or any software tool. This task requires precise measurements, tactile feedback, and direct human expertise to ensure the proper alignment and function of the dental appliances. As such, this task falls under the category of tasks that cannot be significantly aided by LLM or LLM-powered tools due to the physical and specialized nature of the work.
