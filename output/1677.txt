1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of calculating weight, volume, or cost of goods to be moved as a Freight Forwarder, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. In this case, the task involves basic calculations related to logistics and transportation. The LLM can easily assist with performing these calculations by providing formulas, step-by-step instructions, or even generating sample calculations. Since this task primarily involves text input and output related to calculations, the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality. Therefore, this task falls under the category of E1 - Direct exposure, as the LLM can assist in writing and transforming text according to complex instructions related to calculations.
