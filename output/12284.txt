1: In this task, the Psychology Teacher, Postsecondary, is required to prepare and deliver lectures to students on various topics in psychology. With access to the powerful OpenAI large language model (LLM), the teacher could potentially use the LLM to generate lecture notes, create presentation slides, gather up-to-date information on the topics to be covered, and even receive feedback on the content. The LLM could assist in summarizing research papers, providing insights on the latest studies, and generating questions for assessments. However, the task also involves the delivery aspect, which requires human interaction, vocal inflection, and engagement with students. While the LLM can help with content creation, it cannot replace the live delivery of lectures. Therefore, the exposure to the LLM would fall under E2 as having access to the LLM alone may not reduce the time significantly for preparing and delivering lectures, but additional software could be developed to enhance the process.
