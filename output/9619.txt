1: In this task, a nursing assistant is required to measure and record food and liquid intake or urinary and fecal output and report any changes to the medical or nursing staff. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we can break down the task:
- The task involves recording data accurately, which can be done efficiently by an LLM through text input and output.
- The task does not require any specialized domain knowledge beyond basic healthcare terminology, which the LLM can handle.
- The task does not involve any visual analysis or detailed image processing, so image capabilities are not necessary.
- The task does not involve making decisions that impact human livelihood or require precise measurements.

Based on these considerations, the task can be effectively completed with an LLM, reducing the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete it. Therefore, the task falls under label E1.
