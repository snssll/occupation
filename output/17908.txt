1: In this task, a makeup artist working in theatrical and performance settings is required to write makeup sheets detailing specific looks and the products used, as well as take photos to document these looks. With access to the most powerful OpenAI large language model (LLM), the artist could potentially use the LLM to assist in writing detailed makeup sheets by providing descriptions of the looks, techniques used, and even recommendations for products. The LLM could also help in organizing the information in a clear and concise manner. However, when it comes to taking photos to document the looks, the LLM does not have the capability to capture images, so this part of the task would still need to be done manually. Overall, while the LLM can assist in part of the task, it cannot fully automate it.
