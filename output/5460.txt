1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of "Direct facility maintenance or repair" for Spa Managers, we need to consider the capabilities of the OpenAI large language model (LLM) and how it can assist in completing this task. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM can help in writing and transforming text, providing edits to existing text, and generating questions or responses. For this task, the LLM could potentially assist in creating maintenance or repair reports, documenting issues, or even providing step-by-step instructions for repairs.
- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time for completing facility maintenance or repair tasks, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to provide detailed repair guides, maintenance schedules, or even real-time troubleshooting assistance.
- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Since this task involves physical maintenance or repair work, image capabilities may not significantly impact the completion time.
