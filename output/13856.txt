1: In this task, a Parts Salesperson is responsible for receiving payment from customers or obtaining credit authorization for purchases. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves a straightforward interaction with customers to process payments or credit authorizations.
- The task does not require complex decision-making or specialized domain knowledge beyond basic sales and payment processing procedures.
- The task is primarily focused on transactional activities related to sales.

Given these considerations, the task of receiving payment or obtaining credit authorization for parts sales does not significantly benefit from the capabilities of a large language model. The task is routine and does not involve complex text processing, analysis, or decision-making that would require the use of an LLM. Therefore, this task would fall under E0 as the use of an LLM would not reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete the task with high quality by at least half.
