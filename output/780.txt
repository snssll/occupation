1: In this task, a construction laborer is required to apply caulking compounds either by hand or using caulking guns to protect against the entry of water or air. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. Since this task involves physical work that requires manual dexterity and precision, it is unlikely that the LLM or any tool built on top of it can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task. The task does not involve complex decision-making, analysis of large amounts of data, or specialized knowledge that the LLM could leverage to provide a substantial time-saving benefit. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not meet the criteria for exposure to LLM capabilities.

2: E0

3: High
