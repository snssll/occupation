1: In this task, a Power Distributor and Dispatcher is responsible for preparing switching orders to isolate work areas without causing power outages. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we can break down the task:
- The task involves understanding complex technical information related to power systems, which may require specialized domain knowledge.
- It requires referencing drawings of power systems, which could involve interpreting and analyzing visual information.
- The task involves writing detailed switching orders based on the information gathered.

Given the specialized domain knowledge required and the need to interpret visual information, this task falls under E2. While the LLM can assist in generating text-based content, it may not significantly reduce the time needed to complete the task due to the specialized nature of the information and the visual component involved.

2: E2

3: Moderate
