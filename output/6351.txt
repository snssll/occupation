1: In this task, an aerospace engineer is required to evaluate and approve the selection of vendors by studying past performance or new advertisements. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves analyzing text-based information (past performance, advertisements) to make decisions.
- The task does not require specialized domain knowledge beyond what the LLM can provide.
- The task does not involve detailed visual analysis or precise measurements.
- The task does not involve interactions that require human judgment beyond what the LLM can provide.

Based on these considerations, the task can be effectively completed with the help of the LLM by providing insights, recommendations, and potentially drafting responses or reports based on the analysis of text data.
