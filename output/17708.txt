1: In this task of washing dishes, glassware, and silverware after meals as a Fast Food and Counter Worker, the exposure to LLM can be analyzed as follows:

- E1: Direct exposure - The task of washing dishes does not involve complex instructions, specialized knowledge, or detailed data analysis that would require the use of an LLM. The task is straightforward and does not involve writing, summarizing, or analyzing text. Therefore, direct access to the LLM would not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While it is conceivable that software could be developed to automate dishwashing tasks in a fast-food setting, such technology would likely involve physical robotics or specialized equipment rather than just the LLM. The task of washing dishes is more practical to be done manually or with traditional dishwashing equipment, and the LLM alone would not be the most efficient tool for this specific task.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities would not significantly impact the task of washing dishes, as it does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images. The task is more focused on manual labor rather than visual or image-related activities.
