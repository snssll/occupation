1: In this task, a radiologist is required to provide counseling to radiologic patients to explain processes, risks, benefits, or alternative treatments. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. Providing counseling involves a high level of human interaction, empathy, and understanding of the patient's emotional state. It requires the ability to communicate complex medical information in a clear and compassionate manner tailored to the individual patient. This task also involves addressing patient concerns, answering questions, and providing support throughout the diagnostic and treatment process. While an LLM can provide general information on medical processes, risks, and benefits, it lacks the ability to interact with patients, understand their emotions, or provide personalized counseling. Therefore, the task of providing counseling to radiologic patients is highly reliant on human skills and empathy, which cannot be effectively replicated by an LLM.
