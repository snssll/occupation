1: In this task, a general dentist is required to use personal protective equipment (PPE) such as masks, gloves, and safety glasses to prevent the spread of infectious diseases between themselves and their patients. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider whether access to the LLM or LLM-powered tools can significantly reduce the time it takes for a dentist to perform this task with high quality.

- Direct exposure (E1): The task of using PPE is a practical, hands-on task that does not involve writing, transforming text, or complex instructions that the LLM could assist with. Therefore, direct access to the LLM would not reduce the time it takes for a dentist to use PPE effectively.

- Exposure by LLM-powered applications (E2): While it is conceivable that software could be developed to provide reminders or guidelines on PPE usage based on the latest recommendations or guidelines, the task itself does not involve complex data analysis, decision-making, or specialized knowledge that the LLM could significantly enhance.

- Exposure given image capabilities (E3): Image capabilities would not be relevant for this task as it does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images.

Based on the analysis above, the task of using masks, gloves, and safety glasses to protect patients and oneself from infectious diseases would be classified as E0 as access to the LLM or LLM-powered tools would not reduce the time it takes for a dentist to complete this task.

2: E0
