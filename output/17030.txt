1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of testifying in court as to the value of a piece of tangible property as an Appraiser of Personal and Business Property, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves providing expert testimony based on specialized knowledge and experience in property appraisal. The LLM can assist in generating written reports, analyzing data, and providing recommendations based on the information provided. However, the task of testifying in court requires human interaction, legal expertise, and the ability to present evidence effectively, which are not within the capabilities of the LLM. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not significantly benefit from the use of the LLM in reducing the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete the task.
