1: Conducting field work at outdoor sites as a geographer involves physically visiting locations to collect data, observe landscapes, and gather information for research purposes. This task requires being on-site to analyze the environment, take measurements, and make observations firsthand. Since this task involves physical presence and direct interaction with the outdoor environment, it cannot be effectively completed using the capabilities of an LLM or any software tools built on top of it. The task does not involve text input or output that can be processed by the LLM, and it does not fall within the scope of tasks that can be significantly expedited or enhanced by AI tools. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not benefit from exposure to the LLM.
