1: For the task of preparing and serving beverages as a fast-food cook, the exposure to LLM can be analyzed as follows:

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** The task of preparing and serving beverages involves following specific instructions and procedures, which could potentially be aided by the LLM in providing guidance or clarifications on certain steps. The LLM could assist in generating training materials or answering questions related to beverage preparation techniques. However, the task itself is quite straightforward and may not require extensive text generation or complex transformations that would significantly benefit from direct access to the LLM.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While there could be software developed on top of the LLM that provides additional information on beverage recipes, techniques, or variations, the core task of preparing and serving beverages in a fast-food setting may not be significantly enhanced by such applications. The task is more practical and hands-on, focusing on operational efficiency and customer service rather than complex data analysis or decision-making that would require advanced LLM capabilities.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Image capabilities would not have a significant impact on the task of preparing and serving beverages, as it primarily involves text-based instructions and hands-on actions rather than image processing or visual analysis.
