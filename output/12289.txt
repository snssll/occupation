1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of preparing and delivering lectures to undergraduate or graduate students as a postsecondary education teacher, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it. 

- E0: This task involves direct human interaction and requires the teacher to deliver lectures in person. The task also involves a high level of expertise in the subject matter and pedagogy, which may not be easily replaced by the LLM.

- E1: The LLM could potentially assist in generating lecture notes, providing additional resources or references, or helping with the preparation of lecture materials. It could also help in summarizing complex topics or generating questions for assessments. However, the direct delivery of lectures to students would still require human involvement.

- E2: While the LLM could potentially assist in summarizing documents related to the lecture topics, providing additional insights, or even generating lecture outlines, the task of delivering lectures in a dynamic and engaging manner would still primarily rely on the teacher's expertise and interaction with students.

- E3: The task does not involve image capabilities, so this label does not apply.

Based on the analysis, the most appropriate label for this task would be E1.

2: E1

3: Moderate
