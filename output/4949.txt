1: In this task, a Database Architect is required to develop methods for integrating different products to work together seamlessly, such as customizing commercial databases to fit specific needs. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- E0: This task involves a high level of expertise in database architecture and customization, which may not be easily automated by an LLM alone. The task requires specialized knowledge and decision-making that goes beyond simple text generation or analysis.

- E1: While the LLM could potentially assist in providing general information or explanations related to database integration, the task of developing specific methods for integrating products and customizing databases is complex and requires domain-specific knowledge that may not be effectively handled by the LLM alone.

- E2: It is conceivable that additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to assist Database Architects in tasks such as summarizing complex database integration strategies, retrieving specific technical information, or providing recommendations based on data analysis. However, the core task of developing integration methods and customizing databases would likely still require significant human expertise.

- E3: The task does not involve image processing or detailed visual analysis, so exposure to image capabilities would not significantly impact the completion of the task.
