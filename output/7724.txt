1: In this task, a coroner is responsible for investigating the cause, manner, and circumstances of human deaths to establish the identities of deceased persons. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves a significant amount of investigative work, which may require analyzing various sources of information, such as medical records, witness statements, and forensic evidence. The LLM could potentially assist in providing general information on investigative procedures, legal requirements, or common causes of death. However, the task also involves specialized knowledge in forensic science, pathology, and legal procedures, which may not be readily available in the LLM. While the LLM could help with general information and procedural guidance, it may not have the specialized domain knowledge required for this task.
