1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of presenting technical information at conferences as a Materials Engineer, we need to consider how the task can be completed with the help of the LLM.

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** The LLM can assist in writing and transforming text, providing edits to existing text, summarizing documents, and generating questions. In this case, the LLM could potentially help in preparing the technical information to be presented at conferences, creating slides, or drafting speeches. It can also assist in generating questions that the audience might ask during the presentation. Therefore, the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to prepare for the conference presentation.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the LLM alone can help with text-related tasks, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to summarize longer documents, retrieve up-to-date facts, and provide recommendations based on data. This additional software could enhance the efficiency of preparing for the conference presentation by quickly summarizing relevant information and providing insights.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Image capabilities are not directly relevant to the task of presenting technical information at conferences for Materials Engineers. The task primarily involves preparing and delivering verbal presentations rather than working with images.

Based on the above analysis, the task of presenting technical information at conferences as a Materials Engineer is best classified as **E1 (Direct exposure)**.
