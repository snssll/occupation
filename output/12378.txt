1: In this task, a Fast Food and Counter Worker is responsible for preparing and serving cold drinks, frozen milk drinks, or desserts using various machines. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be significantly expedited or improved by using the language model. Since this task involves physical actions such as operating machines and serving customers, it does not directly involve text-based activities that the LLM can assist with. The task does not require complex text transformation, writing, summarization, or any other text-based interactions that the LLM excels at. Therefore, the task does not fall under E1, E2, or E3 categories.

2: E0
