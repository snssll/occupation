1: In this task, a School Bus Monitor is responsible for ensuring the safety of passengers by buckling seatbelts or fastening wheelchair tie-down straps. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves physical actions such as buckling seatbelts and fastening tie-down straps, which cannot be directly performed by an LLM. The task also requires real-time interaction with passengers to ensure their safety, which is not something an LLM can handle. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not involve text-based activities that can be significantly expedited or improved by an LLM.
