1: In this task, a Library Assistant, Clerical inspects returned books for condition and due-date status, and computes any applicable fines. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality. 

Inspecting returned books for condition and due-date status involves visual and manual inspection, which cannot be directly assisted by the LLM. However, computing fines based on due dates and conditions could potentially be aided by the LLM. The LLM could help in calculating fines based on preset rules and conditions provided in the input. The LLM could also assist in generating standardized responses or notifications to patrons regarding fines.
