1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of providing technical expertise in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) technology to clients or users, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be impacted by the use of a large language model (LLM).

- E1: Direct exposure - If the task involves writing and transforming text related to GIS technology, providing edits to existing GIS documents, or answering questions about GIS technology using the LLM, then direct access to the LLM could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality.
  
- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - If there were additional software developed on top of the LLM that could summarize complex GIS documents, retrieve up-to-date GIS information from the internet, or provide recommendations based on GIS data, the task could be completed more efficiently with the help of such tools.
  
- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Since GIS often involves maps and spatial data, having access to image capabilities along with the LLM could potentially aid in tasks like reading text from GIS-related PDFs or creating/editing digital images related to GIS technology.

Considering the task of providing technical expertise in GIS technology to clients or users, the use of an LLM could be beneficial in providing written explanations, answering questions, or even summarizing information related to GIS. Therefore, the task could fall under E1: Direct exposure.

2: E1

3: Moderate
