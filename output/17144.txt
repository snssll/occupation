1: In this task, the firefighter occupation involves training new employees to control and suppress fires. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it. 

- E0: This task involves hands-on training and practical skills that cannot be effectively replaced by text-based assistance from the LLM. The physical aspect of firefighting training, such as using equipment and practicing techniques, cannot be replicated by the LLM.

- E1: While the LLM could potentially provide written materials, guidelines, or theoretical knowledge related to firefighting techniques, it cannot replace the hands-on training required to effectively train new firefighters. The practical aspect of firefighting training is crucial and cannot be adequately addressed by text-based assistance alone.

- E2: It is conceivable that additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to assist in providing theoretical knowledge, creating training materials, or offering simulations for firefighting training. However, the practical hands-on aspect of training new firefighters would still require physical interaction and cannot be fully addressed by software alone.

- E3: The task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images, so the image capabilities of the LLM are not relevant in this context.
