1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of "Select and order or purchase new equipment, supplies, or furnishings" for First-Line Supervisors of Housekeeping and Janitorial Workers, we need to consider the nature of the task and how an LLM could potentially assist in completing it. 

- E0: This task involves making decisions on selecting and purchasing items, which may require physical inspection, comparison, and negotiation with vendors. An LLM alone would not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task, as it involves practical considerations beyond text-based information processing.

- E1: While an LLM could potentially assist in researching different equipment, supplies, or furnishings options based on provided criteria, it cannot physically inspect or test the items. The final decision-making process, negotiation with vendors, and ensuring the suitability of the items for the specific needs of the housekeeping and janitorial operations would still require human judgment and interaction.

- E2: An LLM-powered application could potentially help by summarizing reviews or specifications of different equipment, supplies, or furnishings, providing recommendations based on data analysis, or even suggesting vendors based on previous reviews. However, the actual selection, ordering, and purchasing process would still heavily rely on human decision-making and interaction.

- E3: Image capabilities would not significantly impact the task of selecting and ordering equipment, supplies, or furnishings, as the task primarily involves decision-making based on specifications, quality, and budget considerations rather than visual inspection or creation.
