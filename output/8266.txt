1: In this task, the Registered Nurses are required to instruct individuals, families, or other groups on various health-related topics and develop health improvement programs. To determine the appropriate exposure label for this task in relation to the LLM, we can break it down as follows:

- **Writing and transforming text**: The task involves providing health education and developing programs, which could involve writing educational materials or program outlines. The LLM can assist in generating text for these purposes.
- **Summarizing medium-length documents**: Nurses may need to summarize health information for educational purposes. The LLM can help in summarizing relevant documents.
- **Providing feedback on documents**: The LLM can provide feedback on educational materials or program plans created by the nurses.
- **Prepare training materials based on general knowledge**: Nurses may need to prepare training materials for health education. The LLM can assist in generating training materials based on general health knowledge.

Considering these points, the task can benefit significantly from the LLM's capabilities in generating text, summarizing information, providing feedback, and preparing training materials. Therefore, this task falls under label E1 - Direct exposure.
