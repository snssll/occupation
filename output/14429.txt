1: In this task, the occupation involves Insulation Workers who specialize in removing old insulation, including hazardous materials like asbestos, while following safety procedures. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it. 

- E0: This task involves physical work that requires hands-on removal of insulation materials, including hazardous substances like asbestos. The task also involves following specific safety procedures that may not be easily translatable into text-based instructions for the LLM. As such, the LLM or any tools built on top of it would not significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task safely.

- E1: While the LLM could potentially provide general information on safety procedures for handling asbestos or other insulation materials, the task of physically removing the insulation and ensuring safety compliance is not something that can be directly assisted by the LLM. The hands-on nature of the task and the critical importance of safety procedures make it unlikely that the LLM could reduce the time it takes to complete this task by at least half with equivalent quality.

- E2: It is conceivable that specialized software could be developed on top of the LLM to provide detailed safety guidelines, hazard identification, or procedural recommendations specific to insulation removal tasks. This software could potentially assist in summarizing safety protocols, providing hazard identification tips, or even generating safety checklists. However, the physical aspect of removing insulation, especially hazardous materials, would still require human intervention and adherence to safety protocols.

- E3: The task of removing old insulation, particularly hazardous materials like asbestos, does not involve image processing or creation that would significantly benefit from additional image capabilities alongside the LLM. The task primarily revolves around physical removal and safety procedures, which are not directly related to image processing or creation.
