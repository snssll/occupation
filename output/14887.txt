1: In this task, a Public Relations Specialist is required to respond to requests for information from the media or designate an appropriate spokesperson or information source. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves written communication, specifically responding to requests for information from the media. This can be effectively handled by an LLM, which can generate appropriate responses based on the context provided.
- The task does not involve complex visual or image processing, so the image capabilities of the LLM are not necessary.
- While the task may benefit from specialized domain knowledge in the field of public relations, the LLM can still assist in generating responses and providing guidance on selecting appropriate spokespersons or information sources.

Based on these considerations, the task can be significantly expedited and completed with equivalent quality by using the LLM to draft responses and provide guidance on designating appropriate spokespersons or information sources.
