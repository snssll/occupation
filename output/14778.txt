1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of researching new financial products or analytics as a Financial Quantitative Analyst, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The task involves researching and evaluating financial products or analytics, which can benefit from the LLM's ability to process and analyze large amounts of text data. The LLM can assist in summarizing information, providing insights, and generating reports based on the research conducted. This direct access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to gather information and make informed decisions about new financial products or analytics.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone can be helpful in conducting research and analysis, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to further enhance the process. For example, specialized tools could be created to retrieve up-to-date financial data, perform complex data analysis, or generate predictive models based on the research findings. These applications could streamline the research process and provide more advanced insights.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not directly relevant to the task of researching financial products or analytics. This task primarily involves text-based research and analysis, which can be effectively handled by the LLM without the need for image processing capabilities.

Based on the above considerations, the task of researching new financial products or analytics as a Financial Quantitative Analyst is best classified as E1: Direct exposure.
