1: In this task, the main responsibility is to direct pilots to runways or maintain a traffic pattern until space is available for landing. This task involves real-time decision-making based on current air traffic conditions. While an LLM could potentially provide information on air traffic control procedures and guidelines, it cannot directly interact with real-time data from air traffic control systems or communicate with pilots. The task requires immediate responses and coordination with multiple parties, which goes beyond the capabilities of an LLM. Therefore, the task does not fit into any of the exposure categories (E0, E1, E2, E3) as it involves real-time decision-making and human interaction that cannot be replicated by an LLM.

2: E0

3: High
