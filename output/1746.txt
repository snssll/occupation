1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of carrying out special services for customers as a teller, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be impacted by the use of the LLM. In this case, the task involves interacting with customers to fulfill specific requests related to banking services, such as ordering bank cards and checks. This task requires human interaction, understanding customer needs, and processing specific requests accurately. While the LLM could potentially provide information on the process of ordering bank cards and checks, it cannot directly interact with customers or carry out the physical tasks involved in fulfilling these requests. Therefore, the task of carrying out special services for customers as a teller is not suitable for automation or significant assistance from the LLM.
