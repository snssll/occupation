1: In this task, the occupation involves disassembling and repairing mechanical control devices or valves using various tools. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be significantly aided by the use of the language model. Since the task involves hands-on work with physical tools like power tools, hand tools, and cutting torches, it does not directly involve text-based activities that the LLM can assist with. The LLM cannot physically disassemble or repair mechanical devices, so its utility in this task is limited. Therefore, the task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM.

2: E0
