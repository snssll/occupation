1: In this task of issuing licenses to individuals meeting standards, a Compliance Officer needs to ensure that the applicants meet the required criteria before granting them a license. The task involves verifying information, checking qualifications, and ensuring that all necessary documentation is in order. With the help of a powerful OpenAI large language model (LLM), the Compliance Officer could potentially streamline the process by automating the initial verification steps, cross-referencing information, and generating standard responses based on predefined criteria. The LLM could assist in quickly identifying discrepancies or missing information in applications, thus expediting the overall licensing process.

Considering the nature of the task and the capabilities of the LLM, this task falls under E2 - Exposure by LLM-powered applications. While direct access to the LLM alone may not reduce the time it takes to complete the task by at least half, it is easy to imagine additional software that could be developed on top of the LLM to enhance the efficiency of the licensing process significantly.
