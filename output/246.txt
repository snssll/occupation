1: In this task, a registered nurse is required to administer medications to patients and monitor them for reactions or side effects. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. Administering medications involves following specific dosages and schedules, which may not require the use of an LLM. Monitoring patients for reactions or side effects involves observing physical symptoms and responding accordingly, which is a hands-on task that cannot be performed by an LLM. Since this task involves direct patient care and physical interaction, it falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM.
