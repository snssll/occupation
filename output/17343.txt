1: In this task, the Acute Care Nurses are required to treat wounds or superficial lacerations. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. Treating wounds or lacerations involves hands-on medical care, which cannot be performed by an LLM or any software tool. This task requires physical interaction with patients, assessing the severity of the wound, cleaning the wound, applying appropriate dressings, and potentially administering medications. Since this task involves direct physical intervention and cannot be automated or completed by an LLM, it falls under E0.
