1: In this task, a lawyer is required to present evidence to defend clients or prosecute defendants in criminal or civil litigation. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. Lawyers typically rely on legal knowledge, case precedents, statutes, and regulations to build their arguments and present evidence in court. While an LLM can assist in generating text, providing legal information, or even drafting legal documents, the task of presenting evidence in court involves a high degree of human interaction, understanding of legal nuances, and real-time decision-making based on the judge's reactions, opposing counsel's arguments, and witness testimonies. This task also involves the ability to think on one's feet, adapt to changing circumstances, and effectively communicate complex legal concepts to a judge or jury. Given these factors, it is unlikely that the LLM alone or any software built on top of it could significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced lawyer to complete this task with high quality. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it requires a high degree of human interaction, real-time decision-making, and legal expertise that cannot be fully replicated by an LLM.
