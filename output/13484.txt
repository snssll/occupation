1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of providing support and information to functional areas as a Clinical Data Manager, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be completed with the help of an LLM. In this case, the task involves communicating information to various departments within a healthcare organization. An LLM could assist in generating written communication, summarizing data for reports, drafting emails, and providing responses to inquiries. The LLM could also help in preparing training materials or maintaining records of written data related to the support and information provided.

Given that the task primarily involves written communication and information management, the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task by assisting in generating, summarizing, and responding to written content. Therefore, this task falls under the category of E1 - Direct exposure, as direct access to the LLM can reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality by at least half.
