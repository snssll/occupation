1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of advising students on academic and vocational curricula, and on career issues as an Area, Ethnic, and Cultural Studies Teacher, Postsecondary, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be supported by the capabilities of the LLM.

- E0: This task involves providing personalized advice to students based on their individual academic and career goals. It requires a high degree of human interaction, understanding of the students' backgrounds, and the ability to tailor recommendations to their specific needs. The LLM, even in its most powerful form, cannot replicate the nuanced understanding and empathy required for effective academic and career advising.

- E1: While the LLM can provide general information on academic and career topics, it lacks the ability to engage in a dialogue, understand the unique circumstances of each student, and provide personalized advice. The task of advising students goes beyond writing and transforming text; it involves active listening, empathy, and building a relationship with the student. Therefore, the LLM alone cannot significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality.

- E2: It is conceivable that additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to assist in organizing and retrieving information related to academic and vocational curricula, as well as career issues. This software could potentially help in summarizing relevant data, providing recommendations based on general knowledge, and organizing resources for advisors. However, the core aspect of personalized advising would still require human input and understanding.

- E3: The task of advising students does not involve image capabilities, so exposure to LLM and image capabilities would not significantly impact the completion of this task.
