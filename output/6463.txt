1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of evaluating patients' laboratory and medical records as a midwife, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be supported by the capabilities of the LLM.

- The task involves reviewing and analyzing medical records, which can benefit from the LLM's ability to process and understand text data.
- The LLM can assist in summarizing information from the records, providing insights or recommendations based on the data, and even generating reports or notes based on the analysis.
- While the LLM can help with text-based tasks, it may not significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced midwife to evaluate the records, as it cannot directly access or interpret the specific medical information contained in the records.
- The task does not involve image processing or detailed visual analysis, so the image capabilities of the LLM are not relevant here.

Based on these considerations, the task of evaluating patients' laboratory and medical records as a midwife would likely fall under label E2 - Exposure by LLM-powered applications.
