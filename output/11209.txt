1: In this task, the occupation involves participating in games at gambling establishments to ensure there is a minimum number of players at a table. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with high quality. The task involves physical presence and interaction in a specific environment, which cannot be replaced by text-based interactions with the LLM. The LLM cannot physically participate in games at a table, so it cannot directly assist in this task. Therefore, the task does not fall under E1, E2, or E3 exposure levels.

2: E0

3: High
