1: In this task, the Educational, Guidance, and Career Counselors and Advisors need to identify cases of domestic abuse or family problems and encourage students or parents to seek help from mental health professionals. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we can break down the task:
- Identifying cases of domestic abuse or family problems involves understanding and recognizing various signs and symptoms, which may require specialized training and experience.
- Encouraging students or parents to seek help from mental health professionals involves providing support, guidance, and resources in a sensitive and empathetic manner.

Given the complexity and sensitivity of this task, it involves a high level of human interaction, specialized training, and ethical considerations. While the LLM can provide general information on domestic abuse and mental health resources, the task requires nuanced judgment, empathy, and real-time interaction, which are beyond the capabilities of the LLM.
