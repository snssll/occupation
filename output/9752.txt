1: In this task, an Education Administrator needs to meet with various government agencies to stay updated on policies and discuss improvements for education programs. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we can break down the task:
- Researching current policies and updates from federal, state, and local agencies: The LLM can assist in summarizing and providing information on existing policies and updates, potentially saving time in gathering this information.
- Generating ideas for improvements in education programs: The LLM can help generate suggestions and ideas based on the input provided, potentially streamlining the brainstorming process.
- Drafting reports or proposals based on the discussions: The LLM can assist in drafting reports or proposals based on the meeting discussions, saving time in writing and organizing the information.

Considering the above breakdown, the task involves a significant amount of text-based research, idea generation, and report writing, all of which can be facilitated by the LLM. Therefore, this task falls under E1 as direct access to the LLM can reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality by at least half.
