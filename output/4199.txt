1: The task of delivering and retrieving items throughout the library by hand or using a pushcart does not involve complex text input or output that would benefit significantly from the use of a large language model (LLM). This task is physical in nature and requires manual labor rather than text-based processing. Therefore, there is no clear way for the LLM to directly assist in completing this task. As such, this task falls under the category of E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM or any tools built on top of it.
