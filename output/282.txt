1: In this task, a Residential Advisor is responsible for administering, coordinating, or recommending disciplinary and corrective actions for residents in a residential setting. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we can break down the task:
- Administering disciplinary actions may involve documenting incidents, communicating with residents, and implementing consequences.
- Coordinating corrective actions could include collaborating with other staff members, organizing interventions, and following up on progress.
- Recommending disciplinary and corrective actions may involve assessing situations, providing guidance, and making suggestions based on policies and best practices.

Given the nature of the task, it primarily involves written communication, documentation, and decision-making based on established guidelines and procedures. The task does not require specialized domain knowledge beyond what is typically covered in training for Residential Advisors. While the task involves some level of judgment and discretion, it is mainly about following protocols and ensuring the well-being of residents.
