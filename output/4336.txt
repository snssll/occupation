1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of designing databases, such as mutagenesis libraries, for Molecular and Cellular Biologists in terms of exposure to LLM, we can consider the following steps:

- Molecular and Cellular Biologists often need to design databases to store and manage large amounts of genetic and biological data efficiently.
- The task of designing databases involves structuring data, defining relationships between different data points, and ensuring data integrity.
- While an LLM could potentially assist in generating text-based descriptions or summaries of databases, it may not significantly reduce the time it takes for a Molecular and Cellular Biologist to design complex databases like mutagenesis libraries.
- The task of designing databases requires specialized domain knowledge in biology and bioinformatics, which may not be easily captured by an LLM alone.
- An LLM-powered application could potentially be developed to assist in organizing and summarizing data for databases, but the specialized nature of the task may require additional software with highly specialized knowledge capabilities.

Based on these considerations, the task of designing databases, such as mutagenesis libraries, for Molecular and Cellular Biologists would likely fall under label E2 - Exposure by LLM-powered applications.
