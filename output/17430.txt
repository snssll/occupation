1: In this task, the Bridge and Lock Tenders are responsible for turning valves to control water levels in locks. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if access to the LLM or LLM-powered tools can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality. Since this task involves physical actions of turning valves, it does not involve text input or output that can be processed by the LLM. The LLM cannot physically interact with the valves or control water levels in locks. Therefore, the task does not fall under any of the categories where the LLM could provide assistance.
