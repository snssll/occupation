1: In this task, the Recreation and Fitness Studies Teacher is required to prepare and deliver lectures to students on various topics related to recreation and fitness. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves creating lecture content, which can benefit from the use of an LLM to generate detailed explanations, examples, and summaries of complex topics. The LLM can assist in researching up-to-date information, providing insights, and even generating potential questions for student engagement. However, the task also requires the teacher to deliver the lectures in person, which involves human interaction and presentation skills that the LLM cannot directly assist with. Therefore, while the LLM can aid in content creation, it cannot replace the teacher's role in delivering the lectures in person.
