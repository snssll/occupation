1: In this task, the main responsibilities involve making minor electrical and mechanical repairs to machines and notifying supervisors when major service is needed. This task does not involve writing, summarizing, analyzing text, or any other activity that can be directly assisted by an LLM. The task requires physical interaction with machines and equipment, which cannot be performed by the LLM. Additionally, the task involves decision-making based on the physical state of the machines, which is beyond the capabilities of the LLM. Therefore, this task does not fall under any of the exposure categories (E0, E1, E2, E3) as it does not involve activities that can be significantly assisted by an LLM.
