1: In this task, a Surgical Technologist is responsible for maintaining a proper sterile field during surgical procedures. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality. The task of maintaining a sterile field involves physical actions and precise movements in a surgical setting, which cannot be directly assisted by the LLM. The LLM does not have the capability to physically interact with the environment or perform tasks that require physical presence. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not meet the criteria for exposure to LLM capabilities.

2: E0
