1: In this task, a Public Relations Manager is responsible for maintaining company archives, which involves organizing and managing historical records, press releases, media coverage, and other important documents related to the company's public relations activities. To determine the appropriate exposure label for this task in relation to the LLM, we can break it down as follows:

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** The task of maintaining company archives can benefit from the LLM by assisting in organizing and categorizing documents, drafting summaries or reports based on archived information, and even generating templates for archiving new documents. The LLM can help streamline the process of managing and accessing archived information efficiently.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time it takes to maintain company archives, additional software built on top of the LLM could enhance the process. For example, an application that can automatically categorize and tag archived documents, retrieve relevant information quickly, or generate insights from the archived data could be developed to improve efficiency.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Image capabilities are not directly relevant to the task of maintaining company archives, as it primarily involves text-based documents and records. Therefore, this task does not fall under E3.

Based on the analysis, the most suitable exposure label for the task of maintaining company archives by Public Relations Managers would be **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications)**.
