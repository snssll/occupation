1: In this task, a Tile and Stone Setter aligns and straightens tiles using tools like levels, squares, and straightedges. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone or with additional software could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task. Since this task involves physical work and precise measurements, it is unlikely that the LLM or any software built on top of it could assist in aligning and straightening tiles in a practical manner. The task requires manual labor and expertise in handling tools, which cannot be replaced by text-based AI models. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not benefit from LLM exposure.
