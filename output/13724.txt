1: In this task, the occupation of clergy involves reading from sacred texts like the Bible, Torah, or Koran. The task itself is straightforward and does not involve complex analysis or decision-making. The task does not require any specialized domain knowledge beyond what is contained in the sacred texts themselves. Since the task is simply reading from existing texts, it does not benefit from the capabilities of the LLM, as the model cannot provide any additional insights or interpretations beyond what is already written in the sacred texts. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as there is no clear way for the LLM to significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced clergy member to complete this task.

2: E0
