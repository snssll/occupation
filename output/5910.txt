1: In this task, a Shoe and Leather Worker is required to dress and finish boots or shoes by trimming the edges of new soles and heels to the shoe shape. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. This task involves manual dexterity and skill in working with physical materials like leather and soles. It requires precision in trimming the edges to match the shoe shape, which involves a tactile sense and visual inspection. The task does not involve text input or output, complex instructions, or data analysis that could be significantly aided by an LLM. Therefore, this task does not align with any of the exposure labels that involve text-based tasks or data analysis.
