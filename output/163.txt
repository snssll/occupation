1: In this task, a Bus and Truck Mechanic and Diesel Engine Specialist is required to adjust or repair computer-controlled exhaust emissions devices. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM could potentially assist in providing information on troubleshooting steps, repair procedures, or technical specifications related to computer-controlled exhaust emissions devices. It could help in generating written instructions, explanations, or summaries of relevant information that could aid the mechanic in performing the adjustments or repairs. The LLM could also assist in generating documentation or reports related to the work done on these devices.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to provide interactive troubleshooting guides, real-time diagnostic tools, or access to a database of common issues and solutions related to computer-controlled exhaust emissions devices. This software could enhance the mechanic's ability to quickly identify and address problems with these devices.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Since this task involves adjusting or repairing computer-controlled exhaust emissions devices, which may have visual components like sensors, wiring diagrams, or components, having access to image capabilities could be beneficial. The LLM, combined with image capabilities, could assist in viewing and interpreting diagrams, schematics, or images related to these devices, helping the mechanic understand the components and their connections.
