1: In this task, a Medical Dosimetrist is required to identify and outline bodily structures using various imaging procedures. The task involves analyzing medical images from x-rays, MRIs, CT scans, and PET scans to accurately identify and outline specific anatomical structures. While an LLM could potentially assist in providing general information about these imaging procedures and the types of bodily structures they can capture, it is not equipped to analyze actual medical images or provide specific guidance on outlining structures based on imaging results. The task requires specialized medical knowledge and expertise in radiology, anatomy, and medical imaging interpretation, which goes beyond the capabilities of the LLM. Therefore, the task does not fall under E1, E2, or E3 exposure categories as the LLM alone cannot significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with high quality.
