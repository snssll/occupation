1: In this task, a substitute teacher is required to provide students with disabilities with assistive devices, supportive technology, or assistance accessing facilities. To complete this task, the substitute teacher needs to have knowledge of the specific needs of students with disabilities, understand how to operate assistive devices, and be able to provide appropriate support in accessing facilities. The task involves a high level of human interaction and physical assistance, which cannot be effectively replaced by an LLM or any software tool. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not clearly decrease the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete the task with high quality by at least half.
