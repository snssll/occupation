1: In this task, a Blockchain Engineer is required to update client and server applications responsible for integration and business logic. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it. 

- The task involves updating client and server applications, which may require understanding complex code, making changes, and ensuring the integration and business logic are maintained.
- The LLM could assist by providing guidance on best practices for updating such applications, suggesting code snippets, explaining potential issues that may arise during updates, or even helping with troubleshooting specific problems.
- While the LLM could provide general information and guidance on software development, it may not have the specific domain knowledge related to blockchain technology and its intricacies.
- The task does not involve visual elements or detailed image processing, so image capabilities are not relevant here.

Based on these considerations, the task could benefit from the LLM's ability to provide information, guidance, and potentially code snippets related to software development tasks. However, the specific domain expertise required for blockchain technology may limit the LLM's effectiveness in this context.
