1: In this task, a Coin, Vending, and Amusement Machine Servicer and Repairer is required to disassemble and assemble machines according to specifications using hand and power tools. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if the task can be significantly expedited or improved by using the LLM. Since this task involves physical disassembly and assembly of machines using tools, it does not directly involve text input or output that the LLM can assist with. The LLM cannot physically manipulate objects or tools, so it cannot directly aid in the hands-on aspect of this task. Therefore, the task does not fall under E1, E2, or E3 as it does not involve text-based interactions or image capabilities that the LLM can assist with.

2: E0
