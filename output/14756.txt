1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of researching case law or outcomes of previous case hearings as a Labor Relations Specialist, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM can assist in completing it. 

- Labor Relations Specialists often need to review case law and outcomes of previous case hearings to inform their decisions and strategies.
- The LLM can help by quickly searching and summarizing relevant case law and outcomes, saving time compared to manual research.
- The task involves text input (search queries) and text output (summarized information), which falls within the capabilities of the LLM.
- The task does not require specialized domain knowledge beyond legal terminology, which the LLM can handle effectively.
- The LLM can provide up-to-date information if it is available in the input text.

Based on these considerations, the task of researching case law or outcomes of previous case hearings as a Labor Relations Specialist would likely fall under E1 - Direct exposure. The LLM can significantly reduce the time needed to gather and summarize relevant information, making the process more efficient for the specialist.
