1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of evaluating regulatory affairs aspects related to green initiatives, such as the use of toxic substances in packaging, carbon footprinting issues, or green policy implementation, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves analyzing and understanding regulatory requirements and policies related to environmental sustainability, which requires a deep understanding of specific regulations and their implications.

- E0: This task involves specialized knowledge of regulatory affairs, particularly in the context of green initiatives. The LLM may not have access to the most up-to-date and specific regulatory information required for this task. Additionally, the task may involve interpreting complex regulations and policies, which may require human judgment and expertise that the LLM may not possess.

- E1: While the LLM can provide general information on regulatory affairs and environmental sustainability, it may not have the specific domain knowledge required to evaluate the regulatory aspects related to green initiatives in detail. The task may involve nuanced interpretations and analysis that go beyond the capabilities of the LLM.

- E2: With the development of additional software that can retrieve and analyze up-to-date regulatory information related to green initiatives, the task could potentially be streamlined. This software could complement the LLM's capabilities by providing real-time updates on regulatory changes and specific details relevant to green policies.

- E3: The task does not involve image processing capabilities, so this label is not applicable.

2: E2

3: Moderate
