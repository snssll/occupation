1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of teaching dance students as a dancer, we need to consider how the task can be completed with the help of the LLM. 

- E0: This task involves direct human interaction and physical movement, which cannot be replaced by the LLM. The nuances of teaching dance, such as demonstrating movements, providing physical corrections, and creating a dynamic learning environment, require human presence and expertise. The LLM cannot physically teach dance students.

- E1: While the LLM can provide information on dance techniques, history, or theory through text input and output, it cannot replace the practical aspects of teaching dance. The interactive and physical nature of dance instruction goes beyond what the LLM can achieve through text alone. Therefore, the LLM cannot significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality.

- E2: It is conceivable that additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to assist dance instructors in creating lesson plans, researching dance styles, or providing theoretical knowledge. This software could potentially help streamline the preparation aspect of teaching dance, but it would not be able to replace the hands-on teaching experience that dancers provide to their students.

- E3: The LLM's text capabilities do not directly apply to the task of teaching dance students, as it requires physical movement and demonstration. Image capabilities would also not significantly aid in teaching dance, as the nuances of movement and expression in dance cannot be accurately captured through images alone.
