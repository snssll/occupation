1: In this task, an Audio and Video Technician is responsible for monitoring incoming and outgoing pictures and sound feeds to ensure quality and notify directors of any possible problems. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves real-time monitoring of audio and video feeds, which requires human judgment and immediate action in case of issues. This task does not involve text-based inputs or outputs that can be easily processed by an LLM. The LLM does not have the capability to directly interact with audio or video feeds in real-time. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not clearly decrease the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete the task with high quality by at least half.
