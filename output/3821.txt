1: In this task, a computer programmer is required to correct errors in a program by making appropriate changes and rechecking the program to ensure the desired results are produced. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves working with text input (code) and text output (program results), which can be effectively handled by the LLM.
- The LLM can assist in providing suggestions for correcting errors in the program by analyzing the code and suggesting changes.
- The LLM can also help in explaining potential errors and providing solutions based on the context provided.
- While the task may require some technical expertise in programming, the LLM can still significantly reduce the time it takes to identify and correct errors in the program.

Based on these considerations, the task can be classified as E1 - Direct exposure.

2: E1

3: High
