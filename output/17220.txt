1: In this task, the choreographers and dancers are required to train, exercise, and attend dance classes to maintain their technical proficiency, physical ability, and fitness levels. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes for an average worker to complete this task with equivalent quality. 

- Direct exposure (E1): The task of training, exercising, and attending dance classes involves physical activities that cannot be directly assisted by the LLM. While the LLM could potentially provide information on dance techniques, fitness routines, or schedules, the core aspect of physical training and attending classes cannot be replaced by the LLM. Therefore, direct exposure (E1) is not applicable here.

- Exposure by LLM-powered applications (E2): While the LLM could potentially provide information on dance techniques, fitness routines, or even personalized training plans based on general knowledge, it cannot physically assist in training or attending classes. However, it is conceivable that additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to provide personalized training plans, track progress, or offer virtual dance classes. This additional software could potentially reduce the time it takes to organize training and exercise routines. Therefore, exposure by LLM-powered applications (E2) is a possibility.

- Exposure given image capabilities (E3): The task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images. Therefore, exposure given image capabilities (E3) is not applicable in this context.

Based on the above analysis, Exposure by LLM-powered applications (E2) seems to be the most fitting label for this task.

2: E2

3: Moderate
