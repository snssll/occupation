1: In this task, a Residential Advisor is responsible for enforcing rules and regulations to ensure the smooth operation of dormitory programs. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves understanding and implementing rules, regulations, and policies related to dormitory programs. The LLM can assist in providing information on general rules and regulations, drafting communication materials to inform residents about the rules, and potentially generating responses to common scenarios related to rule enforcement. However, the task also requires real-time decision-making, interpersonal skills, and judgment calls that are based on specific contexts and individual situations. The LLM may not be able to fully understand the nuances of each unique situation or provide guidance on complex interpersonal interactions that are crucial in this role. Therefore, while the LLM can provide some support in terms of generating written materials or general information, it may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with high quality.
