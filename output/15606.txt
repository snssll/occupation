1: In this task, the amusement and recreation attendants are responsible for selling and serving refreshments to customers. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality. The task involves direct interaction with customers, handling transactions, and serving refreshments, which are physical actions that cannot be performed by the LLM. The LLM cannot assist in tasks that require physical presence or actions. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not involve written or spoken text that the LLM can process.

2: E0

3: High
