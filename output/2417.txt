1: In this task of collecting past-due bills as a Meter Reader in Utilities, the primary responsibility involves tracking down customers who have not paid their bills on time. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it more efficiently. 

- E0: This task involves a high degree of human interaction and potentially requires physical visits to customers' locations to collect payments. The LLM cannot physically interact with customers or handle cash transactions, making it unsuitable for this task.

- E1: The LLM could potentially assist in drafting written communication to remind customers of their overdue bills or provide templates for collection letters. However, the core aspect of physically collecting payments from customers cannot be automated by the LLM alone.

- E2: While the LLM could help in generating reminders or drafting communication, additional software that integrates with the LLM could potentially streamline the process by automating reminders, tracking overdue bills, and suggesting personalized messages based on customer data. This software could enhance the efficiency of the task but would not completely automate the physical collection process.

- E3: The task of collecting past-due bills does not involve image capabilities, so exposure to LLM with image capabilities is not relevant in this context.
