1: In this task, the Excavating and Loading Machine and Dragline Operators are responsible for supervising ground workers engaged in specific activities. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves overseeing and directing manual labor activities, which may not directly benefit from the capabilities of an LLM. The task does not involve complex text processing, data analysis, decision-making based on information retrieval, or image-related tasks. As such, the task does not align with the capabilities of an LLM or systems built on top of it. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not significantly benefit from LLM capabilities.
