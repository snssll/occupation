1: In this task, a Structural Metal Fabricator and Fitter is required to verify the conformance of workpieces to specifications using squares, rulers, and measuring tapes. This task involves precise measurements and manual inspection of physical objects. The task does not involve complex language processing or generation that would benefit significantly from the capabilities of a large language model. Therefore, there is no clear way that access to an LLM would reduce the time it takes to complete this task with high quality by at least half. As such, this task falls under the E0 category as it does not benefit from LLM exposure.

2: E0

3: High
