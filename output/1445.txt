1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of attending press conferences to gather information for broadcast as a Broadcast Announcer or Radio Disc Jockey, we need to consider how the LLM can assist in this task. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM can help in summarizing information from press conferences, drafting questions to ask during the conference, or even preparing scripts based on the gathered information. This can significantly reduce the time and effort required to gather and process information from press conferences.
- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not reduce the time to complete the task by half, additional software could be developed to automatically summarize press conference information, extract key points, and even generate reports based on the gathered data.
- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not directly relevant to attending press conferences, as the task involves gathering information through listening and interacting with speakers rather than visual content.

Based on the above analysis, the task of attending press conferences to gather information for broadcast would likely fall under E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications.
