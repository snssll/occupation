1: In this task, a First-Line Supervisor of Security Workers is required to advise employees on handling problems or resolving complaints from various individuals. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves providing guidance and advice based on specific situations and interactions with customers, tenants, detainees, or other individuals. This task requires human judgment, empathy, and understanding of complex interpersonal dynamics, which are not easily replicable by an LLM. While the LLM can provide general advice or suggestions based on input text, it lacks the real-time context, emotional intelligence, and nuanced understanding required for effective advice in such situations. Therefore, the task falls under E0 as it involves a high degree of human interaction and requires human judgment that cannot be effectively replaced by the LLM.
