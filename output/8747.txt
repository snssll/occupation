1: In this task, a jeweler is required to lay out designs on metal stock and cut along markings to fabricate pieces used to cast metal molds. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it. 

- E0: This task involves physical work that cannot be directly replaced by the LLM. The precision required in laying out designs and cutting metal stock would be challenging for the LLM to replicate without physical interaction.
- E1: The LLM could potentially assist in providing design ideas, instructions, or even generating text-based templates for laying out designs. It could also help in providing information on different cutting techniques or materials. However, the actual physical cutting of metal stock would still require human intervention.
- E2: While the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time to complete the task, additional software could be developed to provide virtual simulations of design layouts, cutting patterns, or even virtual training on metalworking techniques. Such software could enhance the jeweler's skills and efficiency.
- E3: The task does not involve image processing or detailed visual instructions that would significantly benefit from image capabilities. Therefore, this task is not suitable for an E3 label.
