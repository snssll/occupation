1: In this task of disassembling malfunctioning medical equipment and repairing or replacing defective parts, the exposure to LLM can be evaluated as follows:

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** The task involves technical knowledge and hands-on skills in repairing medical equipment, which may not be directly aided by the LLM. While the LLM can provide information on troubleshooting steps or general repair techniques, it cannot physically disassemble equipment or perform repairs. Therefore, direct access to the LLM alone would not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** It is conceivable that specialized software could be developed on top of the LLM to assist in diagnosing equipment issues, providing repair manuals, or suggesting replacement parts based on the equipment's symptoms. Such software could potentially streamline the repair process and reduce the time required to complete the task.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Image capabilities would not significantly impact the disassembly and repair of medical equipment, as the task primarily involves physical manipulation of the equipment and technical expertise rather than visual analysis.

Based on the above analysis, the task of disassembling malfunctioning medical equipment and repairing or replacing defective parts would likely fall under **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications)**.
