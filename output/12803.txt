1: In this task, the Career/Technical Education Teacher is responsible for preparing students for later grades by encouraging them to explore learning opportunities and persevere with challenging tasks. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be significantly aided by the use of the language model. The task involves providing guidance and motivation to students, which is a human-centric role requiring empathy, understanding, and personalized interaction. While the LLM can provide general information on teaching strategies or motivational techniques, it cannot replace the nuanced human touch needed in this task. The task involves understanding students' individual needs, emotions, and progress, which are aspects beyond the capabilities of the LLM.
