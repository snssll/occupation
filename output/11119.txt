1: In this task, a Financial Manager is responsible for overseeing the flow of cash or financial instruments within an organization. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be impacted by the capabilities of the LLM.

- E0: This task involves overseeing financial transactions and managing cash flow, which requires a high level of human judgment, decision-making, and interaction with complex financial systems. The task involves real-time decision-making, risk assessment, and strategic planning, which are not easily automated by an LLM.

- E1: While the LLM can provide information and insights related to financial management, such as generating reports, analyzing data, or providing recommendations based on historical data, the core functions of overseeing cash flow and financial instruments involve real-time decision-making and interactions that go beyond the capabilities of the LLM alone.

- E2: It is conceivable that additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to assist Financial Managers in tasks such as data analysis, risk assessment, or financial forecasting. This software could potentially leverage the LLM's capabilities to process large amounts of financial data and provide insights to support decision-making. However, the complex nature of financial management tasks may still require human expertise and judgment.

- E3: The task of overseeing cash flow and financial instruments does not directly involve image processing or visual data. Therefore, the image capabilities of the LLM would not significantly impact the completion of this task.
