1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of conducting office automation feasibility studies as a Computer User Support Specialist, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM could assist in writing reports, analyzing data, and providing recommendations based on the information provided for the feasibility studies. It can help in summarizing information, generating cost comparison analysis, and even suggesting workflow improvements based on the input data. This direct access to the LLM could significantly reduce the time needed to complete the task with equivalent quality.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone can provide valuable insights and analysis for the feasibility studies, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to automate certain aspects of the workflow analysis, space design, or cost comparison analysis. This software could enhance the efficiency of the process by automating repetitive tasks or providing more detailed analysis based on specific criteria.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities would not significantly impact the completion of this task as it primarily involves data analysis, workflow assessment, and cost comparison analysis, which are text-based activities. 

Based on the above considerations, the task of conducting office automation feasibility studies as a Computer User Support Specialist would likely fall under E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications.
