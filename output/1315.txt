1: In this task, the Acute Care Nurses are required to assist patients in organizing their health care system activities. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be facilitated by the use of the LLM.

- E1: Direct exposure - The task involves assisting patients in organizing their health care system activities, which may require writing instructions, providing guidance, or summarizing information. The LLM can be used to generate personalized instructions, create schedules, or even provide educational materials to help patients organize their healthcare activities more effectively. The LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to create these materials compared to manual methods.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone can assist in generating text-based materials to help patients organize their healthcare activities, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to provide more interactive tools or personalized recommendations based on the patient's specific needs. This additional software could further enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of organizing healthcare activities.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not directly relevant to the task of assisting patients in organizing their health care system activities. This task primarily involves text-based communication and coordination rather than image processing.
