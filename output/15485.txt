1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of selecting pressing machines based on garment properties for Pressers in the textile and garment industry, we need to consider the level of exposure to LLM.

- E1: Direct exposure - If the task involves researching and identifying pressing machines based on garment properties, the LLM could significantly reduce the time by providing information on different types of pressing machines, their features, and how they align with garment properties. The LLM can assist in generating a list of suitable machines based on heat tolerance requirements, thus expediting the decision-making process.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not reduce the time by half for this task, it is conceivable that additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to create a tool specifically tailored for selecting pressing machines in the textile industry. This tool could integrate data on garment properties, machine specifications, and industry standards to streamline the selection process.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not directly relevant to the task of selecting pressing machines based on garment properties. This task primarily involves textual information about garment properties and machine specifications, which can be effectively handled by the LLM without the need for image processing.

Based on the above analysis, the task of selecting appropriate pressing machines based on garment properties for Pressers in the textile and garment industry aligns best with **E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications**.
