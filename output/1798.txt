1: In this task, a Radio, Cellular, and Tower Equipment Installer and Repairer is required to check antenna positioning to ensure specified azimuths or mechanical tilts and adjust them as necessary. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be completed more efficiently with the help of the language model. Since this task involves physical work and precise adjustments to equipment, it does not seem like the LLM or any tools built on top of it can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task. The task requires hands-on adjustments and technical expertise that cannot be replaced by text-based tools. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as the LLM would not provide a substantial advantage in completing the task.
