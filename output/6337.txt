1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of estimating time or resource requirements for ergonomic or human factors research or development projects as a Human Factors Engineer or Ergonomist, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be aided by the use of a large language model (LLM).

- This task involves analyzing and planning research or development projects related to ergonomics and human factors. The LLM can assist in providing information on best practices, methodologies, and previous case studies in the field of human factors engineering.
- The LLM can help in generating estimates based on historical data, industry standards, and project requirements provided in the input.
- The LLM can also assist in summarizing complex information related to ergonomic research, which can aid in making informed decisions about resource allocation and project timelines.

Considering these points, the task can benefit significantly from the LLM's capabilities in providing relevant information, generating estimates, and summarizing data to support decision-making in ergonomic and human factors projects. Therefore, this task falls under label E1 - Direct exposure.

2: E1
