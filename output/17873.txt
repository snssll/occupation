1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of writing customer orders and sales contracts according to company guidelines for Driver/Sales Workers, we need to consider the nature of the task and how LLM exposure could impact it.

- Writing customer orders and sales contracts involves transforming text according to specific guidelines, which is a task that can be effectively handled by an LLM.
- The task does not require specialized domain knowledge beyond general business practices, which means the LLM should be able to generate accurate text based on the input provided.
- The task does not involve complex visual elements or interactions that would require additional capabilities beyond text generation.
- The task does not involve highly sensitive or legally restricted information that would pose a challenge for the LLM to handle.

Based on these considerations, the task of writing customer orders and sales contracts for Driver/Sales Workers is likely to benefit significantly from direct exposure to the LLM, as it involves text generation and following specific guidelines.
