1: In this task, a makeup artist working in theatrical and performance settings is required to establish budgets and work within those budgetary limits. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it. 

- E0: This task involves financial planning and budget management, which typically requires human judgment, negotiation skills, and an understanding of the specific context of the theatrical and performance industry. The LLM may not significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced makeup artist to establish budgets and work within them, as it involves complex decision-making beyond text-based information processing.

- E1: While the LLM could potentially assist in providing general information on budgeting principles or examples of budget templates, the task of establishing budgets and working within budgetary limits in a specialized field like theatrical and performance makeup artistry likely requires domain-specific knowledge, experience, and human judgment that cannot be fully replaced by the LLM alone.

- E2: It is conceivable that additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to assist makeup artists in this task by providing recommendations based on industry-specific data, trends, and best practices. This software could potentially analyze budget data, suggest cost-saving measures, or offer insights into budget optimization within the theatrical and performance context.

- E3: The task of establishing budgets and working within budgetary limits does not involve image processing or creation, so the image capabilities of the LLM would not significantly impact the completion of this task.
