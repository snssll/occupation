1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of preparing and maintaining records detailing tests, repairs, and maintenance for Electrical and Electronics Repairers, Powerhouse, Substation, and Relay, we need to consider the nature of the task and how an LLM could assist in completing it.

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** An LLM could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task by assisting in writing detailed records, summarizing information, and organizing data. The model could help in transforming text and code according to complex instructions, maintaining records of written data, and providing feedback on documents related to tests, repairs, and maintenance.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While an LLM alone may not reduce the time by half for this task, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to further streamline the process. This software could include capabilities such as searching over an organization's existing knowledge or data to retrieve information, making recommendations based on data input, and analyzing written information to inform decisions related to tests, repairs, and maintenance.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Image capabilities would not significantly impact the completion of this task as it primarily involves text-based record-keeping rather than image processing or analysis.
