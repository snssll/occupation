1: In this task, a surveyor is responsible for preparing or supervising the preparation of various data, charts, plots, maps, records, and documents related to surveys. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves a significant amount of text-based work, such as organizing data, creating charts, and preparing documents.
- The task does not require specialized domain knowledge beyond what a large language model like the LLM can provide.
- The task does not involve complex image processing or detailed visual analysis.
- The task does not involve real-time decision-making or human interaction that cannot be automated.

Based on these considerations, the task of preparing data, charts, plots, maps, records, and documents related to surveys can benefit from the capabilities of a large language model like the LLM to assist in generating, organizing, and summarizing textual information efficiently.
