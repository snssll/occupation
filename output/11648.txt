1: In this task, a Veterinary Assistant or Laboratory Animal Caretaker is required to perform routine laboratory tests or diagnostic tests, such as taking or developing x-rays. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be impacted by the capabilities of the LLM.

- E0: This task involves hands-on work that requires physical interaction with animals and laboratory equipment. It also involves precise measurements and technical skills that cannot be replicated by the LLM alone.

- E1: While the LLM could potentially provide information on how to perform routine laboratory tests or diagnostic tests, such as general guidelines or protocols, it cannot physically perform the tests or handle the equipment required for taking or developing x-rays. The task involves practical skills that go beyond text-based instructions.

- E2: It is conceivable that additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to assist in summarizing information related to laboratory tests or diagnostic procedures. However, the core task of physically performing these tests, especially taking and developing x-rays, still requires hands-on work that the LLM or software alone cannot accomplish.

- E3: The task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images. Therefore, the image capabilities provided in E3 are not directly relevant to this task.
