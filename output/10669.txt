1: In this task, the Gambling and Sports Book Writers and Runners are responsible for opening or closing cash floats or game tables. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if the task can be significantly expedited or improved by using the LLM. 

- The task of opening or closing cash floats or game tables involves physical actions such as handling money and setting up or closing down physical game tables. These actions cannot be directly performed by the LLM or any software tool based on it.
- The task does not involve complex text input or output, translation, summarization, document analysis, or any other text-based activities that the LLM excels at.
- There is no clear way for the LLM to assist in this task as it requires physical presence and manual actions.

Based on these considerations, the task of opening or closing cash floats or game tables does not align with any of the exposure labels provided. It falls under E0 as it does not benefit from LLM capabilities.
