1: In this task, the occupation of Tour Guides and Escorts involves speaking foreign languages to communicate with foreign visitors. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider how the LLM can assist in this task. The LLM can help by providing translations, language learning resources, cultural information, and even common phrases or expressions in various languages. This assistance can significantly reduce the time it takes for a tour guide or escort to communicate effectively with foreign visitors, as they can quickly access translations and language support.

Given that the task involves language communication, which is a text-based activity, the LLM can directly assist in translating and providing language support. This falls under the E1 label as the LLM can reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality by at least half.
