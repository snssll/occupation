1: In this task, the Physics Teacher, Postsecondary, is required to prepare and deliver lectures to students on complex topics such as quantum mechanics, particle physics, and optics. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- E0: This task involves the direct interaction between the teacher and students during lectures, which requires human presence, explanation, and engagement. The task does not involve text-based activities that can be significantly automated by an LLM.

- E1: While an LLM could potentially assist in generating lecture notes, summarizing content, or providing additional information on specific topics, the core aspect of preparing and delivering lectures involves human interaction, explanation, and engagement, which cannot be fully automated by an LLM.

- E2: It is conceivable that an application could be developed to assist in summarizing research papers, generating lecture notes, or providing additional insights on physics topics. However, the core task of preparing and delivering lectures still heavily relies on the teacher's expertise, teaching style, and ability to engage with students, which goes beyond the capabilities of an LLM.

- E3: The task does not involve image processing, reading text from PDFs, or creating/editing digital images, so exposure to image capabilities would not significantly impact the completion of this task.
