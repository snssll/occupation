1: In this task, the occupation of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons involves performing minor cosmetic procedures like chin and cheekbone enhancements. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be aided by the LLM. 

- E0: This task involves hands-on surgical procedures that require precise measurements and physical skills. The LLM cannot perform physical tasks or provide real-time assistance in surgical procedures, so it does not reduce the time it takes for an experienced surgeon to complete the task.

- E1: The LLM could potentially assist in providing information on the latest techniques, materials, or guidelines related to cosmetic procedures. It could also help in generating patient education materials or answering general questions about the procedures. However, the actual performance of the surgical procedure itself, especially one involving physical alterations like chin and cheekbone enhancements, cannot be directly assisted by the LLM.

- E2: While the LLM could potentially be used to summarize research articles, guidelines, or patient cases related to cosmetic procedures, it would not significantly reduce the time it takes for a surgeon to perform the actual procedure. Developing software that could provide real-time guidance or assistance during surgical procedures based on the LLM's capabilities would be complex and may not be feasible.

- E3: The task does not involve image processing or analysis that would significantly benefit from additional image capabilities beyond the LLM's text-based capabilities. Therefore, this task does not fall under E3.
