1: In this task of building or assembling robotic devices or systems, the primary activities involve physical construction and assembly work. While the LLM can provide information on robotics concepts, designs, and troubleshooting tips, it cannot physically build or assemble the devices. The task does not involve text input or output that the LLM can directly assist with. Therefore, the task does not fall under E1, E2, or E3 exposure levels as the LLM does not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the physical construction aspect of the task.
