1: In this task, a Talent Director is responsible for preparing actors for auditions by providing scripts and information about roles and casting requirements. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves providing text-based information (scripts, roles, casting requirements) to actors. This task can be easily accomplished using the LLM to generate scripts, summarize casting requirements, and provide information about roles. The LLM can assist in creating tailored scripts and compiling relevant information for actors efficiently. Therefore, this task falls under E1 as direct access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality.
