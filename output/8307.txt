1: In this task, the Special Education Teaching Assistant is required to instruct students in daily living skills such as hygiene, safety, or food preparation. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves providing instructions and guidance to students on specific skills related to daily living. This task primarily involves written and spoken communication to convey information effectively. The LLM can assist in generating instructional materials, providing guidance on effective communication strategies, and potentially offering alternative teaching methods. While the LLM can help in creating instructional content, it may not significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete the task, as the core of the task involves hands-on teaching and interaction with students, which cannot be fully automated by the LLM.
