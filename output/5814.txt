1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of "Document help desk requests and resolutions" for Computer Network Support Specialists, we need to consider how the task can be completed with the help of an LLM.

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** The task involves writing and organizing text, which can be efficiently done with the assistance of an LLM. The model can help in documenting the help desk requests and resolutions by providing structured and detailed information based on the input provided.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the task may not require complex analysis or specialized domain knowledge beyond what an LLM can provide, it is easy to imagine additional software that could be developed on top of the LLM to streamline the process further. This could include automated categorization of requests, generating reports, or integrating with other systems for data analysis.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Image capabilities are not relevant for this task as it primarily involves text-based documentation and does not require image processing.

Based on the above analysis, the task of "Document help desk requests and resolutions" for Computer Network Support Specialists aligns most closely with **E1 (Direct exposure)** as the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality.
