- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to create a database of suppliers, prices, and trends in the jewelry industry. This software could automate the process of sourcing metals and gems based on specific design requirements, thus enhancing efficiency.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities would not significantly impact the task of selecting and acquiring metals and gems for designs, as the task primarily involves research, analysis, and decision-making based on text information rather than visual data.
