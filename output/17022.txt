1: In this task, a Budget Analyst is required to testify before examining and fund-granting authorities to clarify and promote proposed budgets. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves providing verbal explanations and justifications for proposed budgets to authorities. This task does not involve writing or transforming text, summarizing documents, retrieving specialized domain knowledge, or analyzing written information. It primarily requires verbal communication skills and expertise in budget analysis. Since the task involves testifying in person before authorities, it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM or any software built on top of it. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not benefit from the capabilities of the LLM.
