1: In this task, the Outdoor Power Equipment and Other Small Engine Mechanics are required to demonstrate to customers how to maintain their equipment properly. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. Showing customers how to maintain equipment involves hands-on demonstrations, verbal instructions, and potentially physical interaction with the equipment. This task requires practical, real-world demonstrations that cannot be effectively replaced by text-based instructions or virtual demonstrations. While an LLM could potentially provide written instructions on equipment maintenance, it cannot physically show customers how to perform maintenance tasks. Therefore, the task falls under E0 as it involves a high degree of human interaction and physical demonstration.
