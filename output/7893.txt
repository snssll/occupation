1: In this task, a First-Line Supervisor of Helpers, Laborers, and Material Movers, Hand is required to inspect job sites to determine the extent of maintenance or repairs needed. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be significantly aided by the use of the language model. The task involves physical inspection of job sites, which cannot be directly assisted by the LLM. The LLM cannot physically inspect sites or provide real-time data on the maintenance or repairs needed. While the LLM could potentially assist in generating reports or documentation based on the supervisor's observations, the core task of physically inspecting the job sites remains outside the capabilities of the LLM.
