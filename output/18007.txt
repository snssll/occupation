1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of writing, updating, and maintaining computer programs as a Computer Programmer, we need to consider the level of exposure to LLM. 

- E1: Direct exposure - Writing and transforming code according to complex instructions could be significantly expedited by using the LLM to generate code snippets, provide solutions to coding problems, or assist in debugging. The LLM could also help in translating code between languages or summarizing technical documentation related to programming tasks.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not reduce the time to complete programming tasks by half, additional software built on top of the LLM could enhance the efficiency of tasks such as summarizing lengthy technical documents, retrieving up-to-date programming information, or providing recommendations based on coding best practices.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities would not significantly impact the task of writing, updating, and maintaining computer programs, as this task primarily involves text-based coding rather than image processing.

Considering the nature of the task, the most appropriate label appears to be E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications, as the LLM could be utilized in conjunction with specialized software to streamline programming tasks beyond what the LLM can achieve alone.
