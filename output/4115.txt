1: In this task, a Merchandise Displayer and Window Trimmer is required to cut out designs on various materials based on the theme or motif of an event. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The LLM can assist in providing instructions, generating design ideas, and potentially even creating digital representations of the designs. However, the task involves physical cutting of materials, which cannot be directly performed by the LLM. While the LLM can help with generating text-based instructions or design ideas, the actual execution of cutting designs on physical materials would still require human intervention.

Considering the limitations of the LLM in physically manipulating materials, the task does not fall under E1, as the LLM alone cannot significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task. Additionally, developing software on top of the LLM to perform physical cutting is not feasible. The task does not involve detailed measurements or precise interactions that would require image capabilities, so it does not fall under E3 either. Therefore, the most appropriate label for this task is E0.

2: E0

3: High
