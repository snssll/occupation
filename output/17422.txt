1: In this task, a cleaner of vehicles and equipment is required to turn valves or handles on equipment to regulate pressure or flow of water, air, steam, or abrasives from sprayer nozzles. This task involves physical interaction with equipment and machinery, requiring manual dexterity and knowledge of how to adjust settings to achieve the desired pressure or flow. Since this task is hands-on and involves physical manipulation of equipment, it does not involve text-based or information processing that could benefit significantly from the capabilities of an LLM. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM or any tools built on top of it.
