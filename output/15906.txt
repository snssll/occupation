1: In this task, Ophthalmic Laboratory Technicians are required to shape lenses appropriately so that they can be inserted into frames. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. Shaping lenses involves a hands-on, physical process that requires precision and skill. This task does not involve text input or output that can be easily processed by an LLM. The task also does not involve analyzing text, generating responses, or accessing information that can be readily handled by an LLM. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM or any tools built on top of it.

2: E0
