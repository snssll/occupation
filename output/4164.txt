1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of de-greasing aircraft exteriors as an Aircraft Service Attendant, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be impacted by the use of the OpenAI large language model (LLM).

- De-greasing aircraft exteriors is a physical task that involves the manual cleaning of the exterior surfaces of an aircraft to remove grease and dirt buildup.
- This task does not involve text input or output, complex instructions, data analysis, or decision-making that can be directly assisted by the LLM.
- The task requires physical interaction with the aircraft and the use of cleaning equipment, which cannot be replaced by text-based assistance from the LLM.
- While the LLM could potentially provide information on the best practices for de-greasing aircraft exteriors or safety guidelines, the actual execution of the task cannot be significantly aided by the LLM.

Based on these considerations, the task of de-greasing aircraft exteriors as an Aircraft Service Attendant would be classified as E0 - No exposure to the LLM.
