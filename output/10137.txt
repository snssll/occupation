1: In this task, a Cooling and Freezing Equipment Operator and Tender is required to monitor various instruments like pressure gauges, ammeters, flowmeters, and thermometers to ensure that specified conditions are maintained. They also need to adjust controls to maintain conditions such as feed rate, product consistency, temperature, air pressure, and machine speed. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality.

- E0: This task involves hands-on monitoring of physical equipment and adjusting controls in real-time. The task does not involve writing or transforming text, providing edits, summarizing documents, or any other text-based activities that the LLM could directly assist with. Therefore, it is unlikely that the LLM or any LLM-powered tool could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task.
