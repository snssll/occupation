1: In this task, a baker is required to combine measured ingredients in bowls of mixing, blending, or cooking machinery. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves a physical aspect of combining ingredients in machinery, which cannot be directly performed by an LLM. While the LLM could potentially provide information on recipes, techniques, or troubleshooting tips related to baking, it cannot physically carry out the task of combining ingredients in machinery. Therefore, the task does not align with the capabilities of the LLM or any tools built on top of it. As a result, this task falls under E0 as it does not benefit from exposure to the LLM.

2: E0

3: High
