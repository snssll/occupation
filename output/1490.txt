1: In this task of authorizing reinsurance of a policy when the risk is high, an Insurance Underwriter would need to assess the risk level of the policy and decide whether to transfer some of that risk to a reinsurer. This decision involves analyzing various factors such as the policyholder's risk profile, the nature of the policy, and the potential impact of a claim. The underwriter would need to consider financial data, policy details, and risk assessment reports to make an informed decision.

Using an LLM, the underwriter could potentially input the relevant information about the policy, the risk factors, and any other pertinent details to get a recommendation on whether reinsurance is advisable in this scenario. The LLM could assist in analyzing the data provided and offering insights based on similar cases or industry standards. However, the final decision to authorize reinsurance would still require human judgment considering the specific context and nuances of the case.

Considering the complexity of risk assessment in insurance underwriting and the need for human judgment in decision-making, this task falls under E2 exposure. While an LLM could assist in analyzing data and providing recommendations, the task involves specialized domain knowledge and decision-making that may not be fully automated.
