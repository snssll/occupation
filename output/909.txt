1: In this task, a private detective or investigator is required to apprehend suspects and release them to law enforcement authorities or security personnel. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves physical action and interaction with suspects, law enforcement, and security personnel, which cannot be performed by an LLM or any software tool. The task also requires real-time decision-making, assessment of the situation, and physical coordination, which are beyond the capabilities of an LLM. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it cannot be significantly aided by the use of an LLM or any LLM-powered tool.
