1: In this task, a Family Medicine Physician, Pediatrician, General Internal Medicine Physician, or Obstetrician and Gynecologist is required to monitor patients' conditions and progress, as well as reevaluate treatments as necessary. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- Direct exposure (E1): The task of monitoring patients' conditions and progress involves a significant amount of human interaction, physical examination, and decision-making based on real-time patient data. While an LLM could potentially assist in providing general information on treatments or guidelines, the core of this task involves hands-on medical assessment and decision-making that cannot be effectively replaced by text-based AI tools.

- Exposure by LLM-powered applications (E2): While an LLM could potentially assist in providing general medical information or guidelines, the task of monitoring patients' conditions and progress is highly specialized and requires real-time patient data analysis, physical examination, and medical expertise that goes beyond what an LLM can provide. Developing software on top of the LLM to assist with this task would be challenging due to the complexity and real-time nature of medical assessments.

- Exposure given image capabilities (E3): Image capabilities would not significantly impact the ability to monitor patients' conditions and progress in this task. The core of the task involves medical expertise, patient interaction, and real-time data analysis, which cannot be effectively supported by image capabilities alone.
