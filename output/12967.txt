1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of presenting statistical and nonstatistical results to audiences, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves transforming data into visual representations like charts and graphs and presenting them in meetings or conferences. The LLM can assist in generating text-based content, including explanations of statistical results, but it does not have direct image capabilities to create charts or graphs. While the LLM could potentially help in drafting the accompanying text for the presentation, the actual creation of visual aids would require additional software beyond the LLM's current capabilities. Therefore, this task falls under E2 as it could benefit from additional software that could be developed on top of the LLM to create visual representations of the data.
