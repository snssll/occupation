1: In this task, a Woodworking Machine Setter, Operator, or Tender is required to install and adjust various tools such as blades, cutterheads, boring-bits, or sanding-belts using hand tools and rules. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if the task can be significantly aided by the use of the LLM. Since this task involves physical manipulation of tools and equipment, it does not directly involve text input or output that the LLM can process. The LLM cannot physically handle tools or perform the manual adjustments required in woodworking tasks. Therefore, the task does not fall under E1, E2, or E3 categories as it does not involve text-based processing or image capabilities that the LLM can assist with.
