1: In this task, a Freight Forwarder is required to provide detailed port information to importers or exporters. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM can assist in completing it. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM can help in providing detailed port information by generating text based on the input provided. It can summarize relevant data, regulations, and procedures related to different ports, making it easier for the Freight Forwarder to communicate this information to importers or exporters. The LLM can also assist in answering specific questions about ports, thereby reducing the time and effort required to gather and present this information.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone can provide valuable assistance in generating text and information related to ports, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to enhance its capabilities further. For example, a specialized tool could be created to retrieve up-to-date port information from various sources and integrate it with the LLM's output, providing more comprehensive and accurate details to importers or exporters.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not directly relevant to the task of providing detailed port information. This task primarily involves text-based information about ports, regulations, and procedures, which can be effectively handled by the LLM without the need for image processing.
