1: In this task of euthanizing rabid, unclaimed, or severely injured animals, the primary responsibility is to humanely put down animals that are suffering or pose a threat to public health. This task involves a significant ethical component as well as technical knowledge on how to euthanize animals properly. The task does not involve text input or output, and the expertise required is not related to the capabilities of a large language model. Therefore, there is no direct exposure of the task to the LLM. Additionally, developing software on top of the LLM to reduce the time it takes to complete this task would not be feasible or ethical. The task does not involve image capabilities or any other aspects where the LLM could be applied. Hence, this task falls under E0 as it does not benefit from exposure to the LLM.
