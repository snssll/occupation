1: In this task of purchasing necessary equipment as a Computer and Information Systems Manager, the exposure to LLM can be evaluated as follows:

- E1: Direct exposure - If the task involves researching and comparing different equipment options, generating purchase orders, and communicating with vendors, the LLM can significantly reduce the time needed for these activities by providing information on the latest technology trends, comparing specifications, drafting emails, and generating purchase orders.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not reduce the time by half for this task, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to streamline the procurement process by automatically sourcing quotes, analyzing vendor reliability, and optimizing purchasing decisions based on data analysis.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities would not significantly impact the task of purchasing necessary equipment, as it primarily involves textual information and communication with vendors rather than image processing.

Based on the above analysis, the task of purchasing necessary equipment as a Computer and Information Systems Manager is best classified as E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications.
