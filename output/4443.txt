1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of designing or using assessments to monitor student learning outcomes for Education Administrators, Postsecondary, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it.

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM could assist in generating assessment questions, providing feedback on assessment designs, or even summarizing assessment data. It can help in writing and transforming text related to assessments and educational outcomes based on complex instructions. Therefore, the LLM could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality by at least half.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone can be helpful in generating content related to assessments, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to provide more specialized recommendations, analyze assessment data, or even offer insights into improving student learning outcomes. This additional software could further enhance the efficiency of completing the task.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Since the task does not involve image processing or detailed visual analysis, the image capabilities of the LLM would not significantly impact the completion of designing or using assessments to monitor student learning outcomes.

Based on the above analysis, the task of designing or using assessments to monitor student learning outcomes for Education Administrators, Postsecondary is best classified as E1: Direct exposure.
