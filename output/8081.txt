1: In this task, the Insurance Sales Agents are required to install bookkeeping systems and resolve system problems. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be impacted by the capabilities of the LLM.

- **E0**: This task involves physical installation of bookkeeping systems and resolving system problems, which cannot be directly assisted by the LLM or any software built on top of it. The task requires hands-on technical skills and problem-solving abilities that cannot be replaced by text-based AI models.

- **E1**: While the LLM could potentially provide guidance on resolving system problems through text-based instructions, the actual installation of bookkeeping systems and hands-on troubleshooting would still require physical presence and technical expertise beyond what the LLM can offer.

- **E2**: It is conceivable that software could be developed on top of the LLM to provide troubleshooting guides or recommendations for resolving system problems in bookkeeping systems. However, the physical installation aspect of the task would still remain outside the scope of what the LLM can directly assist with.

- **E3**: The task does not involve image processing or detailed visual analysis, so the image capabilities of the LLM would not significantly impact the completion of this task.

Based on the above analysis, the most appropriate label for this task is **E0**.

2: E0

3: Certainty level: High
