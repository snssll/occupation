1: In this task, an Automotive Body and Related Repairer is required to fit and weld replacement parts into place, using wrenches and welding equipment, and grind down welds to smooth them. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. This task involves physical work that requires manual dexterity, skill in using tools, and knowledge of welding techniques. It does not involve text-based inputs or outputs that could be easily processed by an LLM. The task also involves working with physical objects and machinery, which cannot be directly handled by an LLM. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM or any tools built on top of it.
