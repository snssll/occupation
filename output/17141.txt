1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of training new dealers in the occupation of Gambling Dealers, we need to consider how the task can be completed with the help of the LLM. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM can assist in writing training materials, providing guidelines, creating quizzes, and answering questions related to training new dealers. It can also help in summarizing key points and generating scenarios for training purposes. Overall, the LLM can significantly reduce the time and effort required to prepare training materials and resources for new dealers.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone can be helpful in creating training content, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to provide interactive training modules, simulations, and personalized learning experiences for new dealers. This software could enhance the training process further by incorporating real-time feedback mechanisms and adaptive learning techniques.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not directly relevant to the task of training new dealers in the occupation of Gambling Dealers. Therefore, this task does not fall under E3.
