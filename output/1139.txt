1: In this task, an Educational, Guidance, and Career Counselor is required to assess the needs of clients for assistance in areas such as rehabilitation, financial aid, or vocational training, and then refer them to the appropriate services. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be significantly aided by the language model. The LLM can assist in providing information on various types of assistance available, guidelines for assessing client needs, and potential services for rehabilitation, financial aid, or vocational training. The model can also help in drafting referral letters or communication to the appropriate services. However, the task involves a high level of human interaction, understanding of individual client needs, and decision-making based on personal circumstances, which may not be effectively replaced by the LLM alone. While the LLM can provide general information and templates, the personalized nature of counseling and referral services may require human judgment and empathy.
