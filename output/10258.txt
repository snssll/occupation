1: In this task, the Adhesive Bonding Machine Operators and Tenders are required to mount or load materials into feeding mechanisms of cementing or gluing machines. This task involves physical interaction with machinery and materials, which cannot be directly replaced by an LLM. The task does not involve writing, summarizing, analyzing text, or any other activity that an LLM could significantly assist with. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM.
