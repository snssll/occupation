1: In this task, the Veterinary Assistant is required to provide emergency first aid to sick or injured animals. This task involves hands-on skills, quick decision-making, and physical interaction with animals. The task does not involve writing, summarizing documents, or any text-based activities that could be easily automated by an LLM. The task also requires specialized knowledge in animal care and first aid, which may not be readily available in the LLM.
