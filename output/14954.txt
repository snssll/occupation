1: In this task, an Urban and Regional Planner is required to review and evaluate environmental impact reports related to planning projects or programs. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be significantly aided by the use of the language model. 

- The task involves reading and analyzing text from environmental impact reports, which can be lengthy and complex documents. The LLM can assist in summarizing these reports, extracting key information, and providing insights based on the content.
- The LLM can help in identifying relevant data, trends, and potential impacts mentioned in the reports, which can streamline the evaluation process for the planner.
- While the LLM cannot access up-to-date facts unless provided in the input, it can still assist in analyzing the existing information in the reports and generating insights based on that information.
- The task does not involve detailed visual analysis or require specialized domain knowledge beyond what the LLM can provide.

Based on these considerations, the task of reviewing and evaluating environmental impact reports as an Urban and Regional Planner would likely fall under E1 exposure, as the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to process and extract insights from these reports with equivalent quality.
