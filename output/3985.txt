1: For the task of creating or distributing offline promotional material as an Online Merchant, the exposure to LLM can be evaluated as follows:

- **E0**: This task involves physical materials like brochures, pamphlets, business cards, stationary, or signage, which cannot be directly created or distributed by an LLM. The task requires physical printing and distribution, which is beyond the capabilities of the LLM.

- **E1**: While an LLM could potentially assist in generating text content for the promotional material, such as writing compelling copy for brochures or business cards, the actual creation and distribution of physical materials would still need to be done manually. The LLM could help with the textual aspects of the materials but not the physical production or distribution.

- **E2**: It is conceivable that additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to streamline the process of creating promotional material. This software could potentially automate the design process based on text inputs, suggest layouts, or even provide templates for offline promotional material. However, the physical distribution aspect would still require human intervention.

- **E3**: The task of creating or distributing offline promotional material does not involve image capabilities that would significantly benefit from the LLM's text-to-image capabilities. The task primarily revolves around text content and physical production, which are not directly related to image processing.

Based on the above analysis, the task of creating or distributing offline promotional material as an Online Merchant would best fit under **E2** as it is easy to imagine additional software that could be developed on top of the LLM to streamline the creation process, although physical distribution would still require human intervention.
