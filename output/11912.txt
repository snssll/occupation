1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of planning and implementing changes to service offerings as a Funeral Home Manager, we need to consider the level of exposure to LLM. 

- Funeral Home Managers often need to research community needs, market trends, and revenue-generating strategies to make informed decisions about service offerings. The LLM can assist in gathering and analyzing relevant data, providing insights into community preferences, and suggesting potential changes to service offerings based on current trends.
- The LLM can help generate ideas for new services, draft communication materials to announce changes, and even assist in developing marketing strategies to increase revenue.
- While the task involves decision-making and strategic planning, the LLM can significantly reduce the time needed to gather information, generate ideas, and draft proposals related to service changes.
