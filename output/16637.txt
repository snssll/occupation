1: In this task, a Residential Advisor is responsible for supervising, training, and evaluating residence hall staff. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if the task can be significantly expedited or improved by using the LLM. The task involves human interaction, training, evaluation, and decision-making based on personal interactions and observations. While the LLM could potentially assist in providing general guidance on training techniques or evaluation criteria, the core aspects of supervising and interacting with staff require human judgment, empathy, and real-time feedback. The LLM cannot replace the nuanced understanding and interpersonal skills needed for this task. Therefore, the task falls under E0 as it does not significantly benefit from LLM assistance.

2: E0

3: High
