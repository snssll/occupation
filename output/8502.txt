1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of investigating and correcting errors upon customers' request as a New Accounts Clerk, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it. 

- New Accounts Clerks typically deal with customer and bank records, which involve a significant amount of text-based information.
- The task involves investigating and correcting errors, which may require accessing and analyzing specific details from the records.
- The LLM could assist in providing guidance on error investigation procedures, suggesting common errors to look for, or even generating responses to customers based on the information provided.

Given these considerations, the task could benefit from the LLM's text-based capabilities in providing guidance and generating responses related to error investigation and correction. However, the task may not require complex transformations or specialized domain knowledge beyond what the LLM can provide.
