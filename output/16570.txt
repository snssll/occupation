1: In this task, the occupation involves supervising other social workers. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality. 

- Direct exposure (E1): The task of supervising other social workers involves human interaction, decision-making, and leadership skills that are not easily replaceable by the LLM. While the LLM can provide information and guidance on social work practices, it cannot directly supervise or manage other individuals. Therefore, direct access to the LLM would not reduce the time significantly for this task.

- Exposure by LLM-powered applications (E2): It is conceivable that additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to provide recommendations or insights into effective supervision practices for social workers. This software could potentially analyze data and provide suggestions based on best practices in social work supervision. However, the complexity of human interactions and the nuanced nature of supervision may limit the effectiveness of such software in fully replacing the role of a supervisor.

- Exposure given image capabilities (E3): Image capabilities would not significantly impact the task of supervising other social workers, as it primarily involves human interaction and leadership skills rather than visual or image-related tasks.

Based on the analysis above, the task of supervising other social workers is best classified as E2 - Exposure by LLM-powered applications.
