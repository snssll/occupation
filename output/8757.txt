1: In this task for boilermakers, the main activities involve laying out plate, sheet steel, or heavy metal and marking bending and cutting lines. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves precise measurements, marking lines, and using tools like protractors and compasses. These activities require physical manipulation and accuracy in handling heavy metal materials. While an LLM could potentially provide information on techniques or guidelines for laying out metal, it cannot physically perform the task of marking lines on metal sheets. Therefore, the task falls under E0 as it involves precise measurements and physical manipulation that cannot be replaced by an LLM.

2: E0

3: High
