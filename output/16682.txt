1: In this task, an Audio and Video Technician is required to switch sources of video input, such as from one camera to another, from film to live programming, or from network to local programming. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The LLM can process text inputs and outputs, but it does not have the ability to interact with physical equipment directly. While the LLM could potentially provide guidance on the process of switching video sources based on textual instructions, it cannot physically perform the task of switching sources itself. Therefore, the task does not fall under E1, E2, or E3 as it involves physical actions that the LLM cannot directly assist with.
