1: In this task, the main activity is physically traveling to different locations to conduct tutoring sessions. This task involves in-person interaction and movement, which cannot be replaced by the LLM or any software tools. The LLM cannot physically travel to different locations, so it cannot directly assist in this task. Additionally, the task does not involve text input or output that the LLM could process. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not benefit from exposure to the LLM.
