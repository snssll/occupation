1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of evaluating and selecting providers of services according to customer requirements for Meeting, Convention, and Event Planners, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves analyzing customer requirements, researching service providers, comparing options, and making decisions based on the gathered information. The LLM can assist in researching service providers, summarizing information about them, and potentially even providing recommendations based on customer requirements.
