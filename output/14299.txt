1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of relaying buy or sell orders to securities exchanges or firm trading departments as a Securities, Commodities, and Financial Services Sales Agent, we need to consider the nature of the task. This task involves communication and coordination between the sales agent and the trading entities. The task primarily revolves around transmitting information accurately and efficiently.

- E1: Direct exposure - The task of relaying buy or sell orders involves a significant amount of written communication. An LLM could potentially assist in drafting clear and concise messages to convey these orders effectively. The LLM could help in transforming text according to specific instructions, ensuring the orders are accurately relayed.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time it takes to relay buy or sell orders, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to streamline the process. For example, an application that integrates with trading platforms to directly input orders based on the information provided by the sales agent could enhance efficiency.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not relevant to the task of relaying buy or sell orders in the context of Securities, Commodities, and Financial Services Sales Agents. This task is primarily text-based and does not involve image processing.
