1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of teaching music for specific instruments as a musician or singer, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves providing instruction on playing musical instruments, which requires a combination of practical demonstration, verbal explanation, and personalized feedback. While the LLM can provide general information about music theory, history, and techniques, it lacks the ability to physically demonstrate playing instruments or provide real-time feedback on a student's performance. Therefore, the task of teaching music for specific instruments is highly interactive and hands-on, making it unsuitable for automation or assistance solely by the LLM.
