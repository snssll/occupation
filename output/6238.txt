1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of establishing fundraising or participation goals for special events or specified time periods as a Fundraiser, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it.

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** The task involves setting specific goals for fundraising events, which may require analyzing data, understanding trends, and making informed decisions. The LLM could assist in providing insights, generating ideas for goal-setting, and even drafting communication materials related to the goals. The LLM's ability to process text input and provide relevant information could significantly reduce the time needed to brainstorm and plan fundraising goals.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the LLM alone can provide valuable insights and suggestions for setting fundraising goals, additional software could be developed to enhance the process further. For example, an application that integrates the LLM's capabilities with real-time fundraising data, market trends, and donor information could streamline the goal-setting process even more effectively.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Image capabilities are not directly relevant to the task of establishing fundraising goals, as it primarily involves text-based analysis and decision-making. Therefore, this label is not applicable to this task.

Based on the considerations above, the most suitable label for the task of establishing fundraising or participation goals for special events or specified time periods as a Fundraiser would be **E1 (Direct exposure)**.
