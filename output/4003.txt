1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of creating or updating donor databases as a fundraiser, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. In this task, the LLM can assist in generating, organizing, and updating text-based information related to donor databases. The LLM can help in writing and transforming text according to complex instructions, maintaining records of written data, and potentially even providing recommendations based on the data input. However, the task does not involve complex visual information, precise measurements, or human interaction that would require a different exposure label. Therefore, the task falls under E1 as the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality by providing assistance in handling text-based information and maintaining records.
