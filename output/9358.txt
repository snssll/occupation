1: In this task, a real estate broker is required to maintain a working knowledge of various factors that determine a farm's capacity to produce. This involves understanding agricultural variables, proximity to market centers, and transportation facilities. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM can assist in completing it. 

- E0: This task involves understanding and analyzing complex factors related to farm production capacity, which may require specialized domain knowledge beyond what the LLM can provide. The task also involves staying up-to-date with current information, which the LLM may not be able to provide without specific input. Therefore, the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task.

- E1: The LLM can assist in providing general information on agricultural variables, market centers, and transportation facilities. It can help in summarizing key points, generating questions for further research, or even providing insights based on existing data. However, the task may require more specialized and up-to-date information that the LLM alone may not be able to provide.

- E2: While the LLM can provide general information and insights, additional software could be developed to retrieve up-to-date facts from the internet and combine them with the LLM's capabilities to offer more specific and current information on factors affecting farm production capacity. This additional software could enhance the efficiency of maintaining knowledge in this area.

- E3: The task does not involve image capabilities, so exposure to LLM with image capabilities is not relevant in this context.
