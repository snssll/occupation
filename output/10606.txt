1: In this task, a Stocker or Order Filler is responsible for obtaining merchandise from bins or shelves. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with high quality. Since this task involves physical actions such as moving items from bins or shelves, it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM. The LLM cannot physically interact with the environment or perform tasks that require physical movement. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not benefit from the use of the LLM.

2: E0

3: High
