1: In this task, an Insulation Worker is required to cover and line structures with insulation materials to protect against cold, heat, or moisture. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality.

- E0: This task involves physical labor and the use of tools like saws, knives, rasps, trowels, blowers, which cannot be directly replaced by text-based instructions or information provided by the LLM. Therefore, this task does not fit into the categories where LLM exposure would significantly reduce the time to complete the task.

- E1: The task of physically covering and lining structures with insulation materials cannot be directly translated into text-based instructions or code that the LLM can provide. The nature of the task requires hands-on work and the use of physical tools, which the LLM cannot assist with directly.

- E2: While it is conceivable that software could be developed to assist Insulation Workers in tasks related to planning, estimating material quantities, or providing safety guidelines, the core task of physically insulating structures with materials still requires manual labor and the use of tools. The LLM alone would not be able to significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task.

- E3: The task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images, so the image capabilities of the LLM are not relevant here.

2: E0

3: High certainty
