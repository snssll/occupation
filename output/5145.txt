1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of developing promotions for current programs and specials as a Media Programming Director, we need to consider the level of exposure to LLM. 

- E1: Direct exposure - If the task involves writing and transforming text for promotions, providing edits to existing promotional materials, or generating ideas for promotions, the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete these tasks with equivalent quality by at least half. The LLM can assist in crafting compelling promotional content based on the input provided.
- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not reduce the time it takes to complete the task by half, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to summarize program information, retrieve up-to-date facts for promotions, or analyze audience data to tailor promotions effectively.
- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not directly relevant to the task of developing promotions for programs and specials, so this label is not applicable.
  
Considering the nature of the task and the capabilities of the LLM, it seems that the task falls under E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications. While the LLM can assist in generating promotional content, additional software could enhance the process by providing more specialized insights or data analysis for effective promotions.
