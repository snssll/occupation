1: In this task, an electrician is required to connect wires to circuit breakers, transformers, or other components. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes for an electrician to complete this task with high quality. 

- The task of connecting wires to electrical components involves physical work that cannot be directly assisted by the LLM.
- The LLM does not have the capability to interact with physical objects or perform tasks that require physical manipulation.
- While the LLM could potentially provide theoretical knowledge or guidance on electrical wiring, it cannot physically connect wires to components.
- Therefore, the task of connecting wires to circuit breakers, transformers, or other components falls under E0 as it does not involve text-based work that can be significantly assisted by the LLM.
