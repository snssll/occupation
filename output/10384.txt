1: In this task, a detective or criminal investigator is required to note, mark, and photograph the location of objects found at a crime scene, such as footprints, tire tracks, bullets, bloodstains, and take measurements of the scene. This task involves physical actions like marking and measuring the scene, which cannot be performed by the LLM or any software tool. The task also requires on-site presence and interaction with the crime scene, which cannot be replaced by text-based AI models. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not involve text-based tasks that can be automated or assisted by the LLM.
