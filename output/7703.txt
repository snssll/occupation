1: In this task, an air traffic controller is responsible for initiating or coordinating searches for missing aircraft. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we can break down the task as follows:

- Initiating or coordinating searches for missing aircraft involves a high level of human judgment, decision-making, and coordination with various agencies and resources.
- The task requires real-time communication, quick decision-making, and the ability to handle high-pressure situations effectively.
- While an LLM could potentially assist in providing information or drafting communication messages related to the search, the core aspects of coordinating the search, making critical decisions, and interacting with multiple stakeholders are beyond the capabilities of the LLM.
- The task does not involve text-based tasks that can be easily automated or assisted by an LLM, as it requires immediate action and coordination in a dynamic environment.

Based on these considerations, the task of initiating or coordinating searches for missing aircraft is best classified as E0 - No exposure.
