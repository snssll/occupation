1: In this task, a dental hygienist is required to remove excess cement from the coronal surfaces of teeth. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. This task involves manual dexterity, precision, and knowledge of dental procedures. It does not involve text input or output that can be easily processed by an LLM. The task also requires physical interaction with patients and dental tools, which cannot be replaced by text-based AI models. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM or any tools built on top of it.
