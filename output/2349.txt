1: In this task, a Patternmaker, Wood is responsible for collecting and storing patterns and lumber. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality. 

- The task of collecting and storing patterns and lumber involves physical actions such as moving and organizing materials, which cannot be directly performed by the LLM.
- While the LLM can provide information on best practices for pattern and lumber storage, it cannot physically handle the materials.
- There are no text-based or image-based components in this task that would benefit significantly from LLM capabilities.

Based on these considerations, it is clear that the task of collecting and storing patterns and lumber does not align with any of the exposure labels provided.
