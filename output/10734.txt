1: In this task, the occupation involves attending to locker rooms, coatrooms, and dressing rooms. The specific task mentioned is operating controls that regulate temperatures or room environments. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be significantly aided by the LLM. In this case, the task is quite straightforward and does not involve complex text-based instructions, specialized knowledge, or data analysis that would benefit from LLM capabilities. The task is more physical in nature, requiring manual operation of controls rather than text-based analysis or decision-making. Therefore, it is unlikely that LLM exposure would significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task.
