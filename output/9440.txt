1: In this task of managing and maintaining lodging facilities, the Lodging Managers would typically be responsible for overseeing the operations of the facilities, ensuring guest satisfaction, managing staff, handling reservations, and maintaining the physical aspects of the property. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider whether the task can be significantly aided by the use of the LLM. 

- Direct exposure (E1): The task of managing and maintaining lodging facilities involves a lot of hands-on work, human interaction, and physical oversight. While the LLM could potentially assist in tasks like drafting emails, creating documentation, or providing information on best practices, the core responsibilities of a Lodging Manager are not primarily text-based and involve real-world management. Therefore, the direct use of the LLM may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task.

- Exposure by LLM-powered applications (E2): It is conceivable that LLM-powered applications could be developed to assist Lodging Managers in tasks such as analyzing customer feedback, generating reports on occupancy rates, or providing recommendations based on industry trends. These applications could potentially streamline some aspects of the managerial duties, but the overall management and maintenance of lodging facilities would still require a significant human touch and physical presence.

- Exposure given image capabilities (E3): Image capabilities would not have a significant impact on the task of managing and maintaining lodging facilities. While visual aids could be helpful in areas like property maintenance or interior design, the core responsibilities of a Lodging Manager do not heavily rely on image processing.

Considering the above analysis, the task of managing and maintaining lodging facilities is best classified as E2 - Exposure by LLM-powered applications.
