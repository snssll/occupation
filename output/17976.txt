1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of writing simple programs for computer-controlled machine tools as a Computer Numerically Controlled (CNC) Tool Operator, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The task involves writing text-based programs for CNC machines, which can be formulated as text input and output within the 2000-word context limit of the LLM. The LLM can assist in generating code snippets, providing guidance on programming logic, and offering suggestions for optimizing the programs. This direct access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality by at least half.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the task may not require additional software beyond the LLM itself, it is conceivable that specialized software could be developed on top of the LLM to streamline the programming process further. This software could potentially automate certain aspects of program generation, offer real-time debugging assistance, or provide advanced optimization techniques tailored to CNC programming. However, the task can already be efficiently completed with the direct use of the LLM.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not directly relevant to the task of writing programs for CNC machines, as it primarily involves text-based programming. Therefore, image capabilities do not significantly impact the time required to complete this task.

Based on the above analysis, the most fitting label for the task of writing simple programs for computer-controlled machine tools as a CNC Tool Operator is E1: Direct exposure.
