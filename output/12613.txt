1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of preparing occupational classifications, job descriptions, and salary scales as a Compensation, Benefits, and Job Analysis Specialist, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it.

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** The task involves a significant amount of writing and organizing information, which the LLM is well-equipped to handle. The LLM can assist in generating job descriptions based on input criteria, suggesting salary scales based on industry standards, and even helping with the classification of occupations. The LLM can provide text output based on the input provided, making it a direct tool for completing this task more efficiently.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the LLM can assist in generating text and organizing information, there may be additional software that could be developed on top of the LLM to further streamline the process. For example, specialized software could be created to analyze industry-specific data to suggest salary scales or to retrieve up-to-date information on job classifications. This additional software could enhance the capabilities of the LLM for this task.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Image capabilities are not directly relevant to the task of preparing occupational classifications, job descriptions, and salary scales. This task primarily involves text-based information and does not require image processing.
