1: In this task, a recreation worker is responsible for overseeing various aspects related to recreation facilities and areas, including purchase, planning, design, construction, and upkeep. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes for a recreation worker to complete this task with high quality.

- E0: This task involves physical aspects such as construction and upkeep of facilities, which cannot be directly assisted by the LLM. The LLM cannot perform physical tasks or interact with the physical environment, so it would not significantly reduce the time for a recreation worker to complete these activities.

- E1: The LLM could potentially assist with tasks like drafting planning documents, researching best practices for facility design, generating reports on recreation facility trends, or drafting emails related to facility purchases. However, the core aspects of overseeing construction and upkeep would still require human intervention and physical work, so the time savings may not be significant enough to warrant an E1 label.

- E2: While the LLM could help with research, drafting documents, or providing recommendations based on data, it may not directly reduce the time by half for overseeing the purchase, planning, design, construction, and upkeep of recreation facilities and areas. However, with the development of specialized software that integrates LLM capabilities with project management tools or facility maintenance databases, the time savings could potentially be significant.

- E3: The task does not involve image processing or detailed visual analysis, so the image capabilities of the LLM would not significantly impact the completion time for overseeing recreation facilities.

2: E2

3: Moderate
