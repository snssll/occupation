1: In this task, a Digital Forensics Analyst is required to write reports, sign affidavits, or give depositions for legal proceedings. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- Writing reports: The LLM can assist in generating detailed and accurate reports based on the analysis of digital evidence, legal requirements, and case specifics. This can significantly reduce the time it takes to draft reports compared to manual writing.
- Signing affidavits: The LLM can help in drafting affidavits by providing accurate legal language and ensuring all necessary information is included. However, the actual signing of affidavits is a legal process that requires human involvement.
- Giving depositions: While the LLM can assist in preparing for depositions by providing information and potential questions, the actual process of giving depositions involves human interaction, legal knowledge, and real-time responses.

Considering the above points, the task involves a mix of legal expertise, human interaction, and specific legal processes that cannot be entirely automated by the LLM. Therefore, the most appropriate label for this task would be E0.

2: E0

3: High
