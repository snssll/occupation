1: In this task, a glazier is required to operate cranes or hoists with suction cups to lift large, heavy pieces of glass. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality. 

- E0: This task involves physical work that cannot be automated by the LLM. The operation of cranes and hoists with suction cups requires hands-on skills and precise movements that cannot be replicated by a language model.
- E1: The task does not involve writing, transforming text, or any form of communication that the LLM can assist with. It is a manual task that requires physical labor and specialized skills.
- E2: While it is conceivable that software could be developed to assist with the operation of cranes or hoists, such technology does not currently exist. The task involves specialized equipment and physical actions that are not easily automated.
- E3: The task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images. It is primarily a physical task that does not benefit from image capabilities.

Based on the analysis, the most appropriate label for this task is E0.

2: E0

3: High
