1: In this task, an Occupational Health and Safety Technician is required to examine practices at green building sites to assess if adherence to green building standards affects risks to workers. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be significantly aided by the use of an LLM. 

- The task involves analyzing practices at green building sites, which may require understanding complex safety standards and regulations related to green building practices. The LLM can assist in providing information on these standards and regulations, as well as potential risks associated with non-compliance.
- The technician may need to research and analyze data related to green building practices and safety risks. The LLM can help in summarizing relevant documents, providing insights on industry best practices, and potentially identifying correlations between adherence to green building standards and worker safety.
- While the task involves on-site examination, a significant portion of the work involves data analysis, research, and documentation, which can be supported by the LLM.

Based on these considerations, the task can benefit from the use of the LLM to gather information, analyze data, and provide insights related to green building standards and worker safety risks. Therefore, this task falls under label E1 - Direct exposure.
