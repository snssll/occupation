1: In this task of coordinating property closings, overseeing the signing of documents, and disbursement of funds as a Real Estate Sales Agent, the primary activities involve managing the administrative aspects of real estate transactions. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task and how an LLM could potentially assist in completing it more efficiently. 

- E0: This task involves a high degree of human interaction and legal requirements, such as overseeing the signing of legal documents and handling funds. These activities typically require in-person presence and adherence to specific legal protocols, making it unsuitable for automation by an LLM.

- E1: While an LLM could potentially assist in drafting or reviewing some documents related to the property closing process, the core activities of overseeing signings and fund disbursement involve legal and financial intricacies that require human oversight and verification. The task's complexity and sensitivity may not be effectively handled by an LLM alone.

- E2: An LLM-powered application could potentially be developed to assist Real Estate Sales Agents by summarizing legal documents, providing recommendations based on data analysis, or retrieving relevant information from databases. However, the critical aspects of coordinating property closings, ensuring legal compliance, and managing financial transactions may still require human judgment and interaction.

- E3: Given the limitations of the LLM in handling detailed legal and financial processes, as well as the need for in-person interactions during property closings, it is unlikely that image capabilities would significantly enhance the completion of this task.
