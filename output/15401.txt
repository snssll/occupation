1: In this task, a Heavy and Tractor-Trailer Truck Driver is required to secure cargo for transport using various tools like ropes, blocks, chains, binders, or covers. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality. 

- E0: This task involves physical work that cannot be automated by the LLM. The process of physically securing cargo using ropes, blocks, chains, binders, or covers requires manual labor and cannot be replaced by text-based instructions or automation.
- E1: The task does not involve writing, transforming text, or providing feedback on documents. It is a hands-on task that requires physical interaction with the cargo. Therefore, direct access to the LLM would not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task.
- E2: While it is conceivable that software could be developed to assist in training or providing guidelines for cargo securing techniques, the actual physical act of securing the cargo would still require manual labor. The LLM alone would not be able to automate this task.
- E3: Image capabilities would not be relevant for this task as it does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images.

2: E0
