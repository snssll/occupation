1: In this task for Title Examiners, Abstractors, and Searchers, the main activities involve verifying the accuracy and completeness of land-related documents for registration and preparing rejection notices when documents are not acceptable. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be significantly expedited or improved by using the language model. 

- The task involves analyzing text-based documents, which can be efficiently processed by the LLM for accuracy checks and generating rejection notices based on predefined criteria.
- The LLM can assist in summarizing complex legal language in documents, identifying discrepancies, and suggesting revisions or reasons for rejection.
- While the LLM may not directly reduce the time by half for this task, it can potentially streamline the document review process, provide insights on legal terminology, and offer suggestions for rejection notices.

Considering these points, the task falls under E1 as the LLM can enhance the efficiency and accuracy of document verification and rejection notice preparation, even though it may not halve the time required for completion.
