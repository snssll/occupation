1: In this task, the Gambling Change Persons and Booth Cashiers are required to perform minor repairs on slot machines, such as clearing coin jams. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. Performing minor repairs on slot machines involves technical knowledge and hands-on skills. This task requires physical interaction with the machines, understanding of mechanical components, and troubleshooting abilities. Since the task involves hands-on work and precise actions to clear coin jams, it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM or any software built on top of it. The LLM cannot physically interact with the machines or perform repairs that require manual dexterity. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it cannot be significantly expedited or completed with high quality using the LLM or LLM-powered tools.
