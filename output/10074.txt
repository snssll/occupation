1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of monitoring national or international legislation on ozone-depleting substances or global warming as a Regulatory Affairs Specialist, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be facilitated by the use of a large language model (LLM).

- The task involves staying updated on legislative changes related to specific environmental issues, which may require reading and interpreting complex legal texts and regulations.
- An LLM can assist by summarizing and providing insights into new legislation, analyzing the potential impact on regulations, and even generating reports or summaries based on the information provided.
- The LLM can also help in researching and understanding the implications of these legislative changes, providing a comprehensive overview of the current state of regulations on ozone-depleting substances or global warming.

Considering these points, the task can benefit significantly from the capabilities of an LLM, as it can assist in processing and analyzing large amounts of text data related to legislation efficiently.
