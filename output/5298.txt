1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of devising systems or processes to monitor the validity of risk assessments for Financial Risk Specialists, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be impacted by the use of the LLM.

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** If the task involves writing and transforming text or code to create monitoring systems or processes based on complex instructions, the LLM could significantly reduce the time needed to complete this task. The LLM can assist in generating ideas, drafting text, and providing insights based on existing knowledge.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the LLM alone may not reduce the time to complete the task by half, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to summarize complex risk assessment documents, retrieve up-to-date information related to risk factors, or provide recommendations based on data analysis. These capabilities could enhance the efficiency of devising monitoring systems.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Image capabilities are not directly relevant to the task of devising systems or processes to monitor risk assessments. Therefore, this label is not applicable to this task.
