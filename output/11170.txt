1: In this task, a Facilities Manager is required to participate in architectural and engineering planning and design, including space and installation management. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- E0: This task involves active participation in architectural and engineering planning, which requires human judgment, decision-making, and interaction with other professionals. The task also involves physical spaces and installations, which cannot be directly handled by the LLM or any software tool. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it cannot be significantly expedited by the LLM or any LLM-powered tool.

- E1: The task does not involve writing or transforming text, providing edits, translating languages, summarizing documents, or any other text-based activities that the LLM can directly assist with. The complexity of architectural and engineering planning and design goes beyond the capabilities of the LLM to provide direct assistance in completing the task.

- E2: While it is conceivable that software could be developed to assist Facilities Managers in certain aspects of their work, such as generating reports or analyzing data, the core task of participating in architectural and engineering planning and design is highly specialized and requires domain knowledge that goes beyond what the LLM can provide. Therefore, this task does not fit under E2.

- E3: The task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images. The core requirement of participating in architectural and engineering planning and design is not related to image processing or visual tasks that would benefit from image capabilities.

2: E0

3: Certainty level: High
