1: In this task, a Surgical Technologist is responsible for maintaining files and records of surgical procedures. With the help of the LLM, the technologist could potentially automate the process of documenting and organizing these records. The LLM could assist in summarizing surgical procedures, updating records, and ensuring that all necessary information is accurately recorded. This task involves writing and organizing text data, which aligns with the capabilities of the LLM. Therefore, the LLM could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality.

Considering the nature of the task and the potential for the LLM to streamline the documentation process, I would classify this task as E1 - Direct exposure.

2: E1

3: High
