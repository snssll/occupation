1: In this task, a Maintenance Worker, Machinery collaborates with other workers to repair or move machines, machine parts, or equipment. To determine the appropriate exposure label for this task in relation to the LLM, we need to consider the nature of the task. Since the task involves collaboration and physical work, it does not directly involve text-based activities that can be significantly enhanced by the LLM. The LLM cannot physically repair or move machinery, and the task does not involve complex text-based instructions, data analysis, or decision-making that would benefit from the LLM's capabilities. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM or systems built on top of it.
