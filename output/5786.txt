1: In this task, a Sales Representative of Services is responsible for distributing promotional materials at meetings, conferences, or trade shows. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. Distributing promotional materials involves physical interaction and presence at events, which cannot be directly handled by an LLM. The task does not involve writing, summarizing, analyzing text, or any other activity that an LLM could significantly assist with. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM or any tools built on top of it.

2: E0
