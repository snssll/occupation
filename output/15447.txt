1: In this task, the Cutting and Slicing Machine Setters, Operators, and Tenders need to select and install machine components according to specifications using hand tools. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if the task can be significantly expedited or improved by using the LLM. Since this task involves physical manipulation of machine components using hand tools, it does not directly involve text input or output that the LLM can assist with. The LLM cannot physically interact with the components or tools required for this task. Therefore, the task does not fall under E1, E2, or E3 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM.

2: E0

3: High
