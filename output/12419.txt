1: In this task, a Park Naturalist is responsible for preparing brochures and writing newspaper articles. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- Writing brochures and newspaper articles involves a significant amount of text generation and transformation.
- The task does not require specialized domain knowledge beyond what the LLM can provide.
- The content for the brochures and articles can likely be captured within 2000 words, which is within the LLM's context limit.
- The task does not involve detailed visuals or precise measurements, so image capabilities are not necessary.
- The LLM can assist in generating text, providing edits, and summarizing information, which are all relevant to this task.

Based on these considerations, the task of preparing brochures and writing newspaper articles for Park Naturalists would likely fall under E1 - Direct exposure to the LLM.
