1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of studying reactions of plants, animals, and marine species to parasites as a biologist, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The LLM can assist in tasks that involve text input and output, providing information, generating questions, and maintaining records. In this case, the task involves studying reactions of living organisms to parasites, which requires hands-on observation, experimentation, and data collection beyond text-based information. While the LLM can provide background information on parasites and general reactions, it cannot directly observe or conduct experiments on living organisms. Therefore, the task falls under E0 as it does not significantly benefit from the capabilities of the LLM.

2: E0
