1: For the task of "Play from memory or by following scores" as part of the occupation of Musicians and Singers, we can consider the exposure rubric to determine the appropriate label. 

- E0: This task does not involve any direct interaction with the LLM or require specialized tools beyond traditional musical instruments or sheet music. The task is primarily practical and hands-on, involving musical skills rather than text-based or data-driven work.

- E1: While the LLM could potentially provide information on music theory, history, or techniques related to playing music, it cannot directly assist in the physical act of playing an instrument or singing. The task of playing from memory or following scores is more about practical application of musical skills rather than text-based information processing.

- E2: It is conceivable that software could be developed to assist musicians in learning and practicing music, such as interactive sheet music apps or virtual music tutors. However, the task of playing from memory or following scores is still heavily reliant on the musician's own abilities and practice, rather than on text-based information processing or data analysis.

- E3: The task does not involve image processing or visual information that would require additional capabilities beyond text-based processing. Therefore, exposure to image capabilities would not significantly impact the completion of this task.

Based on the above analysis, the most appropriate label for the task of "Play from memory or by following scores" in the occupation of Musicians and Singers is E0.

2: E0

3: High
