1: In this task, the occupation of Team Assemblers involves supervising and training employees on job procedures. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone or with additional software could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality.

- E1: Direct exposure - The task involves providing instructions, training materials, and possibly answering questions related to job procedures. The LLM could assist in generating written instructions, training materials, and responses to common questions. This could streamline the process of creating these materials, potentially reducing the time needed to train employees.
- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone could help with generating text-based materials, additional software could be developed to create interactive training modules, quizzes, or simulations to enhance the training process further. Such software could integrate with the LLM to provide more dynamic and engaging training materials.
- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Since the task primarily involves written instructions and training materials, image capabilities may not significantly impact the completion of the task.

Based on the considerations above, the task of supervising assemblers and training employees on job procedures could be best classified as E1: Direct exposure.

2: E1

3: Moderate
