1: In this task, a Farm Equipment Mechanic or Service Technician is required to tune or overhaul engines of farm equipment. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves technical knowledge and skills related to engine tuning and overhauling, which may require specific expertise and experience.
- The task does not involve text input or output, and the context is more hands-on and practical rather than text-based.
- The task does not involve accessing up-to-date information or complex databases that could benefit from the LLM's capabilities.
- The task does not involve image processing or analysis that could leverage the LLM's image capabilities.

Based on these considerations, the task of tuning or overhauling engines for farm equipment does not align with the capabilities of the LLM or any tools built on top of it. Therefore, this task would be classified as E0 - No exposure.
