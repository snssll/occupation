1: In this task, a jeweler is required to smooth soldered joints and rough spots, use hand files and emery paper, and polish smoothed areas with polishing wheels or buffing wire. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be automated or assisted by the language model. Since this task involves physical manipulation of materials like metal and stones, it does not directly involve text-based inputs or outputs that the LLM can handle. The task requires manual dexterity, precision, and knowledge of materials, which are not within the capabilities of the LLM. Therefore, the task does not fall under E1, E2, or E3 exposure levels.

2: E0

3: High
