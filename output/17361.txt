1: In this task, a floral designer is required to trim materials and arrange various floral items using specific tools and materials. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be significantly aided by the language model. The task involves physical manipulation of materials and tools, which cannot be directly assisted by an LLM. While the LLM could potentially provide information on floral arrangement techniques or creative ideas, the core aspect of physically trimming and arranging materials cannot be directly influenced by the model. Therefore, the task does not align with any of the exposure levels that involve text-based or image-related assistance.
