1: In this task, a First-Line Supervisor of Passenger Attendants is required to compute or estimate cash, payroll, transportation, or personnel requirements. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves computational work related to cash, payroll, transportation, and personnel requirements. This can be done efficiently by an LLM through text input and output, as the model can perform calculations, provide estimates, and generate reports based on the input data.
- The task does not involve any visual elements or detailed image processing, so image capabilities are not necessary.
- While the task may require some domain-specific knowledge about passenger attendants, the core of the task is computational and can be handled by the LLM.

Based on these considerations, the task falls under E1 as the LLM can assist in computing or estimating cash, payroll, transportation, or personnel requirements efficiently with text-based input and output.
