1: In this task, the Appraisers and Assessors of Real Estate are required to analyze trends in sales prices, construction costs, and rents to assess property values or determine the accuracy of assessments. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves analyzing data related to real estate trends, which may require accessing and interpreting a large amount of information. While the LLM can assist in providing general information about real estate trends, it may not have access to up-to-date data or specialized domain knowledge required for accurate assessments. The task also involves complex analysis that goes beyond simple text generation or summarization. Therefore, the task does not fall under E1 as the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time to complete the task with equivalent quality. However, it is conceivable that additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to assist in data analysis and trend identification, potentially reducing the time needed to complete the task. Hence, the task aligns more closely with E2 as it may benefit from software that can retrieve up-to-date real estate data, provide recommendations based on data analysis, and offer specialized domain knowledge to enhance the assessment process.
