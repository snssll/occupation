1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of performing undercover operations as a Private Detective or Investigator, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. In this task, the key components involve evaluating the performance or honesty of individuals by posing as customers or employees. The LLM can assist in generating scripts, background information, and scenarios for undercover operations. It can also help in crafting believable personas and responses to various situations.

Therefore, while the LLM can aid in the planning and preparation stages of the operation, it cannot directly perform the task itself.
