1: In this task, a Gambling Surveillance Officer or Investigator is responsible for supervising or training surveillance observers in a gambling establishment. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality. 

- Direct exposure (E1): The task of supervising or training surveillance observers involves providing guidance, instructions, and possibly creating training materials. The LLM can assist in generating training materials, writing instructions, and providing information on best practices for surveillance. It can also help in summarizing key points to convey during training sessions. Therefore, direct access to the LLM can streamline the process of preparing for supervision or training sessions, potentially reducing the time needed to complete the task.
