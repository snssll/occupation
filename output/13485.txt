1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of providing supportive materials for exhibits and displays as a Set and Exhibit Designer, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM can assist in completing it. The task involves creating various written materials such as press kits, advertising, publicity notices, posters, brochures, catalogues, and invitations. The LLM can be used to generate written content, edit existing text, provide feedback on drafts, and even help in translating text if needed. The LLM can also assist in summarizing information and generating questions or responses related to the materials being created. Overall, the LLM can significantly reduce the time and effort required to complete this task by providing support in writing and transforming text according to complex instructions.
