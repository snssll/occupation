1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of applying mathematical theories and techniques to practical problems as a mathematician, we need to consider the extent to which the task can be facilitated by the use of a large language model (LLM). In this case, the task involves utilizing mathematical knowledge and techniques to solve real-world problems across various domains. While an LLM can assist in providing information, explanations, or even basic calculations related to mathematics, the core aspect of applying mathematical theories to practical problems requires specialized mathematical expertise and problem-solving skills that go beyond the capabilities of an LLM. The task involves a high level of domain-specific knowledge and critical thinking, which are not the primary strengths of an LLM. Therefore, the task is not significantly reducible by the use of an LLM, as the expertise and problem-solving skills of a mathematician are essential.
