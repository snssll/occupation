1: In this task, the occupation of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons involves administering general and local anesthetics. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality. Administering anesthetics involves practical, hands-on skills that require precise measurements, knowledge of patient history, and real-time decision-making based on patient responses. The LLM cannot physically administer anesthetics or interact with patients in person. While the LLM could potentially provide information on different types of anesthetics, dosages, side effects, and best practices, it cannot replace the practical application of administering anesthetics.
