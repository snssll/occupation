1: In this task, the occupation involves providing assistance in maritime rescue operations. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality. The task of providing assistance in maritime rescue operations involves practical, hands-on skills, quick decision-making, and physical coordination, which cannot be effectively replaced by text-based AI models like the LLM. The task requires real-time assessment of the situation, physical actions, and interactions with other individuals in potentially dangerous environments. Therefore, the LLM cannot directly assist in performing this task.
