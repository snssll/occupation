1: In this task, the Orderlies are responsible for transporting portable medical equipment or supplies between rooms or departments. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality. Since this task involves physical movement and handling of equipment, it does not directly align with the capabilities of the LLM, which is focused on text-based tasks. The LLM cannot physically transport equipment or supplies. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not meet the criteria for exposure to LLM capabilities.

2: E0

3: High
