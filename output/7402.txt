1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of identifying health or safety issues related to planned weatherization projects as an Energy Auditor, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could assist in completing it.

- **E0**: This task involves assessing health and safety issues, which may require on-site inspections, physical measurements, and interactions with the environment. The LLM, even with its text-based capabilities, may not be able to fully replace the need for physical inspections and assessments in this context.

- **E1**: While the LLM could potentially provide information on common health and safety issues related to weatherization projects, it may not be able to assess specific project plans without detailed visual or on-site information. The LLM could assist in providing general knowledge about health and safety concerns, but the task likely requires more than just text-based information.

- **E2**: An application built on top of the LLM could potentially help by summarizing relevant safety guidelines and regulations, providing recommendations based on input data, or even analyzing specific project plans to flag potential health or safety risks. However, the task still involves a level of specificity and detail that may require more than what the LLM alone can provide.

- **E3**: Given the task involves assessing health and safety issues, having image capabilities in addition to the LLM could significantly aid in analyzing project plans, diagrams, or images related to weatherization projects. The ability to view and interpret visual information could enhance the accuracy and efficiency of identifying potential risks.
