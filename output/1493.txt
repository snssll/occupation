1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of automating the deployment of software updates over geographically distributed network nodes for Blockchain Engineers, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The task involves writing code to automate the deployment process, which can be achieved through the LLM by providing instructions and generating code snippets. The LLM can assist in writing scripts, providing solutions, and transforming text according to complex instructions related to software deployment processes.
  
- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not reduce the time significantly for this task, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to streamline the automation process further. This software could potentially integrate with existing deployment tools and systems to enhance efficiency.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not relevant for this task as it primarily involves software deployment over network nodes and does not require image processing or creation.

Considering the task involves writing code and automating deployment processes, the most suitable label appears to be E1: Direct exposure, as the LLM can assist in generating code and providing solutions for automating software updates deployment.
