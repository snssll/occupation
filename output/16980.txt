1: In this task, a Nuclear Technician is required to test plant equipment to ensure it is operating properly. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes for a Nuclear Technician to complete this task with high quality. 

- The task of testing plant equipment involves hands-on work, precise measurements, and potentially hazardous conditions. The LLM cannot physically interact with equipment or perform the necessary testing procedures.
- While the LLM could potentially provide information on testing procedures or troubleshooting guides, the practical application of this knowledge still requires manual work.
- The task does not involve writing, summarizing documents, or accessing specialized domain knowledge that the LLM could significantly assist with.

Based on these considerations, the task of testing plant equipment as a Nuclear Technician would be classified as E0, as the LLM alone cannot reduce the time it takes to complete this task significantly.

2: E0

3: High
