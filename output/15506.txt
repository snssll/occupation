1: In this task for riggers, the main responsibility is to select gear based on specific criteria such as load weights, sizes, facilities, and work schedules. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone or with additional software could significantly reduce the time it takes for a worker to complete this task with high quality.

- E0: This task involves physical equipment selection based on specific criteria that require hands-on expertise. The task does not involve text-based information processing or decision-making that could be significantly expedited by the LLM or LLM-powered tools.

- E1: The task does not involve writing, transforming text, summarizing documents, or any other text-based activities that the LLM could directly assist with. The task is more hands-on and practical in nature, requiring physical gear selection expertise.

- E2: While it is conceivable that software could be developed to assist riggers in selecting gear more efficiently, such software would likely need to incorporate specialized domain knowledge, real-time data on load weights and sizes, and facility details. This task may not be easily reducible to text-based processing that the LLM excels at.

- E3: The task does not involve image capabilities, such as reading text from PDFs or creating/editing digital images, that could be enhanced by the LLM's text and image processing capabilities.

Based on the analysis, the task of selecting gear for riggers is best classified as E0.
