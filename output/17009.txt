1: Geothermal Technicians are responsible for testing water sources for factors such as flow volume and contaminant presence. To determine the appropriate exposure label for this task in relation to the LLM, we need to consider the nature of the task. Testing water sources involves physical activities such as collecting samples, using specialized equipment, and conducting on-site measurements. These activities cannot be directly performed by the LLM or any software tool based on it. The task also requires specific domain knowledge and expertise in geothermal systems and water testing, which may not be readily available to the LLM. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it involves physical actions, specialized domain knowledge, and cannot be significantly expedited by the LLM.

2: E0
