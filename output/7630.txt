1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of incorporating research findings into practice as a midwife, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it. 

- E0: This task involves interpreting and applying research findings to real-world practice, which requires a high level of human judgment and interaction. The task may involve understanding complex medical information, patient needs, and ethical considerations, which are not easily automated by the LLM. Therefore, this task is unlikely to be significantly expedited by the LLM.

- E1: While the LLM can provide information on research findings and potentially help summarize or explain certain aspects, the task of incorporating these findings into practice involves a nuanced understanding of medical knowledge, patient care, and practical implications. The LLM may assist in providing information, but the critical thinking and decision-making required for this task are best done by a human midwife.

- E2: It is conceivable that specialized software could be developed on top of the LLM to help midwives quickly access and analyze research findings, make recommendations based on the latest evidence, and suggest best practices. This software could potentially streamline the process of incorporating research into practice, but as of now, the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task.

- E3: The task of incorporating research findings into practice does not involve image processing or detailed visual analysis, so the additional image capabilities provided by the LLM would not have a significant impact on completing this task.

Based on the above considerations, the most appropriate label for this task is E2.

2: E2

3: Moderate
