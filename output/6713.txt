1: In this task, a Fabric and Apparel Patternmaker is required to examine sketches, sample articles, and design specifications to determine quantities, shapes, and sizes of pattern parts, as well as the amount of material or fabric required to make a product. To determine the appropriate exposure label for this task in relation to the LLM, we can break it down as follows:

- Writing and transforming text: The task involves analyzing visual and written information to make decisions about fabric patterns, which may not be directly translatable to text input/output tasks.
- Providing edits to existing text: While the task involves examining existing design specifications, it is more about interpreting and applying them practically rather than editing them.
- Summarizing documents: The task does involve summarizing information from sketches and design specifications, but it is more focused on practical application rather than summarization.
- Retrieving specialized domain knowledge: The task requires specialized knowledge in fabric and apparel design, which an LLM may not have access to without specific training data.
- Analyzing written information to inform decisions: The task involves analyzing information to make decisions, but the analysis is more visual and practical in nature rather than textual.

Based on the above analysis, the task of examining sketches, sample articles, and design specifications to determine quantities, shapes, and sizes of pattern parts, and to determine the amount of material or fabric required to make a product does not fit neatly into the categories of exposure to LLM. It involves a combination of visual analysis, practical application, and specialized domain knowledge that may not be directly addressable by an LLM.
