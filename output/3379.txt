1: In this task, a Meter Reader in Utilities is responsible for connecting and disconnecting utility services at specific locations. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. Connecting and disconnecting utility services involves physical actions such as interacting with utility meters, valves, and other equipment at the location. This task requires hands-on work and cannot be completed solely through text-based instructions or information processing. As such, the task falls under the E0 category as it involves physical actions that cannot be replaced by an LLM or any software tool.
