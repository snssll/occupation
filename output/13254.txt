1: In this task of providing customer assistance and information as a Parking Attendant, the main activities involve interacting with customers, giving directions, and potentially assisting with wheelchairs. These tasks are primarily human-centric and involve direct physical interaction with customers. While an LLM could potentially assist in generating scripts for customer interactions or providing information on common questions, the core aspect of physically assisting customers and handling wheelchairs cannot be automated by the LLM. Therefore, the task falls under E0 as it requires a high degree of human interaction and physical assistance.
