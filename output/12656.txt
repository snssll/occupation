1: In this task, a Court, Municipal, and License Clerk is responsible for preparing ordinances, resolutions, or proclamations for execution, recording, archiving, or distribution. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- Writing ordinances, resolutions, or proclamations involves transforming text according to specific instructions, which is a task that can be effectively handled by an LLM.
- The task does not involve highly specialized domain knowledge or up-to-date facts retrieval, as the content of ordinances, resolutions, or proclamations is typically based on existing laws, regulations, or decisions.
- While the task may require some level of legal understanding, the primary focus is on drafting and preparing documents, which aligns well with the capabilities of an LLM.
- The task does not involve detailed visuals or precise measurements, ruling out the need for image capabilities.

Based on these considerations, the task of preparing ordinances, resolutions, or proclamations aligns closely with the capabilities of an LLM for text generation and transformation, making it suitable for a label that reflects direct exposure to the LLM.
