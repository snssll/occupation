1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of setting up and arranging displays or demonstration areas as a Demonstrator and Product Promoter, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. In this task, the main activities involve arranging physical displays and demonstration areas to attract customers. This task does not involve text input or output, and it requires physical interaction with the environment. The LLM does not have the ability to physically set up displays or interact with the physical world. Therefore, the task cannot be significantly aided by the LLM or any tools built on top of it. As a result, this task falls under E0 as it does not meet the criteria for exposure to LLM capabilities.
