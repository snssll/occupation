1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of determining the genetic composition of animal populations and heritability of traits as an Animal Scientist, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves analyzing genetic data and applying principles of genetics, which may require specialized domain knowledge beyond what the LLM can provide on its own. While the LLM can assist in providing general information on genetics and potentially help with some aspects of data analysis, it may not have the specific expertise or tools necessary to fully perform the task efficiently. Therefore, this task may fall under E2 - Exposure by LLM-powered applications, as it could benefit from additional software developed on top of the LLM that provides specialized domain knowledge and tools for genetic analysis.
