1: In this task, an Electrical Engineer is required to investigate or test vendors' or competitors' products. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- Investigating vendors' or competitors' products may involve researching specifications, performance data, user reviews, and technical details. This task can benefit from the LLM's ability to gather and summarize information from various sources quickly.
- The LLM can assist in analyzing and comparing different products based on the provided criteria, helping the engineer make informed decisions.
- The LLM can also aid in generating reports or summaries based on the findings from the investigation, saving time on manual documentation.

Considering these points, the task can be significantly expedited and enhanced in quality by utilizing the LLM's capabilities for research, analysis, and documentation. Therefore, this task falls under the E1 label as direct access to the LLM can reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality by at least half.
