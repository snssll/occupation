1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of depositing guests' valuables in hotel safes or safe-deposit boxes as a Hotel, Motel, and Resort Desk Clerk, we need to consider the nature of the task and how an LLM could potentially assist in completing it.

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** An LLM could help in providing guidelines or standard operating procedures for safely depositing guests' valuables. It could generate responses to common questions or scenarios related to handling valuables, ensuring accuracy and consistency in communication with guests. The LLM could also assist in drafting written instructions or notices to inform guests about the deposit process.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While an LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time it takes to physically deposit guests' valuables, additional software could be developed to integrate with the LLM. This software could provide real-time inventory tracking of deposited items, generate reports on valuables stored, or even offer suggestions for improving the security of the deposit process based on data analysis.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Image capabilities would not have a significant impact on the task of depositing guests' valuables in hotel safes or safe-deposit boxes, as it primarily involves text-based instructions and physical actions rather than image processing.

Based on the above analysis, the most suitable label for the task of depositing guests' valuables in hotel safes or safe-deposit boxes as a Hotel, Motel, and Resort Desk Clerk would be **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications)**.
