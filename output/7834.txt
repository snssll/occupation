1: In this task, a Prepress Technician or Worker is required to inspect developed film for specified results and quality using magnifying glasses and scopes. They then forward acceptable negatives or positives to other workers or customers. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be significantly expedited or improved by using the language model. 

- The task involves visual inspection of film, which requires manual handling and expertise in evaluating the quality of the film.
- While the LLM could potentially assist in providing information on film inspection techniques or quality standards, it cannot physically inspect the film itself.
- The task does not involve text-based analysis or generation that the LLM could directly assist with.
- There are no clear ways in which the LLM could directly reduce the time it takes to complete the task or enhance the quality of film inspection.

Based on these considerations, the task does not align with any of the exposure levels in the rubric as it does not involve text-based analysis or generation that the LLM could assist with, and the nature of the task requires physical inspection that the LLM cannot perform.
