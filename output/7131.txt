1: Music therapists are professionals who use music interventions to help individuals achieve therapeutic goals. One of the tasks they perform is gathering diagnostic data from various sources such as case documentation, client observations, and interviews with clients or family members. To determine the appropriate exposure label for this task in relation to the LLM, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

In this case, the task involves collecting and analyzing information from written sources (case documentation), observations, and interviews. While the LLM can assist in summarizing text, providing feedback on documents, and answering questions about documents, it may not significantly reduce the time it takes for a music therapist to gather diagnostic data from these sources. The task requires human judgment, interpretation of non-textual cues (observations), and interaction with clients and family members, which are not areas where the LLM excels.
