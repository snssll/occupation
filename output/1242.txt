1: Legal secretaries and administrative assistants assist attorneys in collecting information such as employment, medical, and other records. This task involves organizing and managing various types of records to support legal proceedings. To determine the appropriate exposure label for this task in relation to the LLM, we can break it down as follows:

- The task involves a significant amount of text-based work, such as organizing and managing records, which can benefit from the text processing capabilities of the LLM.
- The LLM can assist in summarizing documents, providing feedback on written materials, and potentially even generating questions related to the collected information.
- While the task may not require specialized domain knowledge beyond legal terminology, the LLM can still be valuable in handling the text-based aspects efficiently.

Based on these considerations, the task of assisting attorneys in collecting information aligns most closely with an E1 exposure label. The LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task by providing support in handling text-based information and tasks related to document management.
