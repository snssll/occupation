1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of composing and editing scripts or providing screenwriters with story outlines, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves writing and transforming text according to complex instructions, which is a task that the LLM is well-equipped to handle. The LLM can assist in generating creative content, refining scripts, and providing detailed story outlines based on input criteria. This task does not require specialized domain knowledge beyond general storytelling and scriptwriting skills, which the LLM can support. Therefore, the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality, making it suitable for an E1 label.
