1: In this task, a Photographic Process Worker or Processing Machine Operator needs to read work orders to determine the required processes, techniques, materials, or equipment. To complete this task, the worker must understand and interpret written instructions accurately. The task involves processing textual information and making decisions based on that information. 

Considering the nature of the task, an LLM could potentially assist by quickly processing and interpreting the text in the work orders, highlighting key information, and potentially even suggesting appropriate processes, techniques, materials, or equipment based on the input. The LLM could help streamline the reading and interpretation process, saving time for the worker.

Given that the task involves text input and output, and the LLM can assist in processing and interpreting text efficiently, I would classify this task as E1 - Direct exposure.

2: E1

3: Moderate
