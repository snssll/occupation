1: In this task, a Naturopathic Physician is required to perform minor surgical procedures such as removing warts, moles, or cysts, sampling tissues for skin cancer or lipomas, and applying or removing sutures. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality. 

- E0: This task involves hands-on medical procedures that require precise skills and expertise. The LLM cannot physically perform surgical procedures or provide real-time guidance during surgery. Therefore, the task cannot be completed solely by the LLM or LLM-powered tools.
- E1: The LLM cannot physically perform the surgical procedures mentioned in the task. While it can provide information on medical procedures, it cannot replace the practical skills and experience needed to perform minor surgical procedures. Therefore, direct access to the LLM would not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task.
- E2: While the LLM can provide information on medical procedures and general knowledge related to naturopathic medicine, it cannot perform the surgical procedures itself. Developing additional software on top of the LLM to assist in surgical procedures would not be feasible or safe. 
- E3: The LLM does not have the capability to view, caption, or create images related to surgical procedures. It also cannot provide real-time guidance during surgery. Therefore, the task does not fall under E3 either.
