1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of collecting data about the attitudes, values, and behaviors of people in groups as a Sociologist, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves gathering information through observation, interviews, and document review. While the LLM can assist in summarizing documents and potentially generating interview questions, it cannot directly observe or conduct interviews. The task also requires interacting with individuals and analyzing qualitative data, which are complex human tasks that the LLM alone cannot perform. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it involves a high degree of human interaction and decision-making that cannot be fully automated by the LLM.
