1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of producing reports or presentations as a Financial Risk Specialist, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM can assist in writing and transforming text according to complex instructions, providing edits to existing text, summarizing documents, and generating recommendations based on input. In this case, the LLM could help in drafting the reports or presentations, summarizing findings, and potentially even generating recommendations based on the risk positions analyzed.
- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not reduce the time to complete the task by half, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to summarize longer documents, retrieve up-to-date facts for analysis, and provide specialized domain knowledge to enhance the quality of the reports or presentations.
- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not relevant for this task as it involves producing reports or presentations primarily focused on text-based content.

Considering the task involves producing reports or presentations that require text-based content and recommendations, the most suitable label appears to be E2 as the task could benefit from additional software leveraging the LLM to enhance the quality and efficiency of the analysis and recommendations provided.
