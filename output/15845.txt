1: In this task, a photographer is required to set up photographic exhibitions for displaying and selling work. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone or with additional software could significantly reduce the time it takes for a photographer to complete this task. 

- E0: This task involves physical setup, arrangement of photographs, and potentially interacting with clients or visitors during the exhibition. The LLM does not have the capability to physically set up exhibitions or interact with individuals in person. Therefore, the task cannot be significantly expedited by the LLM alone or with additional software.

- E1: While the LLM could potentially assist in generating written content for promotional materials or descriptions of the exhibited work, the core task of physically setting up the exhibition and engaging with clients cannot be directly handled by the LLM. The time saved by using the LLM for auxiliary tasks may not be substantial enough to warrant an E1 label.

- E2: It is conceivable that additional software built on top of the LLM could help photographers in organizing and cataloging their work, creating digital previews of the exhibition, or generating marketing materials. Such software could streamline the preparation process and potentially reduce the time required for setting up exhibitions. However, as of now, such software does not exist, so the task does not fit squarely into the E2 category.

- E3: The task does not involve detailed image analysis, creation, or editing that would require the capabilities of an image processing system in conjunction with the LLM. Therefore, the task does not fall under the E3 category.
