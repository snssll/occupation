1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of formulating or modifying recipes for specific kinds of food products as a Food Batchmaker, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it.

- E1: Direct exposure - The task involves writing and transforming text (recipes) according to specific instructions. The LLM can assist in providing suggestions for ingredient quantities, cooking methods, and flavor combinations based on existing recipes and culinary knowledge. The model can help generate new recipe ideas or modify existing ones by providing alternative ingredients or techniques.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time it takes to formulate or modify recipes, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to streamline the process. For example, an application could be created to analyze large datasets of recipes to identify trends in ingredient combinations or cooking methods, providing insights for recipe formulation.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not relevant for the task of formulating or modifying recipes for food products, as it primarily involves text-based instructions and culinary knowledge.

Based on the above analysis, the task of formulating or modifying recipes for specific kinds of food products as a Food Batchmaker is best classified as E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications.
