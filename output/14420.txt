1: In this task, the worker is required to remove materials or products from molds or machines and stack or store them for further processing. To determine the exposure level, we need to consider if the task can be completed more efficiently with the help of an LLM. The task involves physical actions such as removing materials and stacking them, which cannot be directly assisted by an LLM. The task does not involve complex decision-making, analysis, or writing that could benefit significantly from LLM capabilities. Therefore, the task does not align with any of the exposure levels in the rubric.

2: E0
