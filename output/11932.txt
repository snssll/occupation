1: In this task, the Educational, Guidance, and Career Counselors and Advisors need to plan and promote career and employment-related programs and events. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if the task can be significantly expedited or improved by using the LLM. The LLM could assist in generating promotional materials, drafting event descriptions, creating engaging content for presentations, and even suggesting strategies to attract participants. The model can also help in researching current trends in career planning and employment to ensure the programs are up-to-date and relevant. Overall, the LLM can streamline the process of planning and promoting these events by providing valuable insights, content suggestions, and research assistance.
