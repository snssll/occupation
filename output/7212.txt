1: For the task of greeting patrons attending entertainment events as an Usher, Lobby Attendant, or Ticket Taker, we need to consider if the task can be significantly impacted by the use of the LLM. In this case, the task involves a simple interaction of greeting patrons, which does not involve complex text generation, analysis, or decision-making that would benefit from the capabilities of the LLM. The task is straightforward and does not require any text transformation, summarization, or specialized knowledge retrieval that the LLM could enhance. Therefore, this task does not align with any of the exposure levels (E1, E2, E3) as it does not involve text-based work or image capabilities that the LLM could assist with.
