1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of responding to and resolving patrons' complaints as a First-Line Supervisor of Gambling Services Workers, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could assist in completing it. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The task involves responding to complaints from patrons, which may require written communication skills to address the issues effectively. The LLM can assist in drafting responses, providing templates for common complaints, or suggesting language to use in resolving conflicts. The LLM can also help in generating appropriate responses based on the context provided in the complaints.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM can aid in drafting responses and providing language suggestions, there may be additional software that could be developed to streamline the process further. For example, an application that can analyze the sentiment of complaints, categorize them, and provide tailored response templates could enhance efficiency in resolving patrons' complaints.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not relevant to the task of responding to and resolving patrons' complaints, as it primarily involves written communication with patrons.

Based on the above analysis, the task of responding to and resolving patrons' complaints as a First-Line Supervisor of Gambling Services Workers aligns best with the E1 label, as the LLM can directly assist in drafting responses and providing language support for addressing complaints.
