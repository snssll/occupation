1: In this task, the choreographer is responsible for managing dance schools or assisting in their management. To complete this task, the choreographer may need to handle administrative tasks, coordinate schedules, oversee staff, plan events, and ensure the smooth operation of the dance school. 

Considering the task description, the choreographer's role involves a significant amount of text-based communication, organization, and decision-making. An LLM could assist in tasks such as drafting emails, creating schedules, providing guidance on staff management, generating event plans, and offering recommendations based on general knowledge of dance school management.

Given that the task involves a mix of administrative duties and decision-making that can be supported by text-based inputs and outputs, the exposure level to LLM would likely fall under E1. The LLM can help with writing and transforming text, providing feedback on documents, and preparing training materials based on general knowledge, all of which are relevant to managing dance schools.
