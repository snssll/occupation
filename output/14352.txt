1: In this task, an upholsterer is required to remove covering, webbing, padding, or defective springs from workpieces using hand tools like hammers and tack pullers. This task involves physical work that cannot be directly assisted by an LLM. The process requires manual dexterity, strength, and knowledge of materials, making it unsuitable for automation through text-based AI models. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not benefit from LLM exposure.
