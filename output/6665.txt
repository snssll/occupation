1: In this task, a First-Line Supervisor of Non-Retail Sales Workers is required to examine merchandise to ensure correct pricing and display, as well as functionality as advertised. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves visual inspection of merchandise, which may not be easily translatable into text-based instructions for an LLM to follow.
- The task also requires physical interaction with the merchandise to check for functionality, which is beyond the capabilities of an LLM.
- While the task may involve some written documentation or reporting, the core aspect of physically examining merchandise is not something an LLM can directly assist with.

Based on these considerations, it is clear that the task of examining merchandise to ensure correct pricing and display, as well as functionality as advertised, falls under E0 as it involves physical inspection and interaction that cannot be effectively handled by an LLM.
