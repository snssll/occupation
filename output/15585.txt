1: Non-Destructive Testing Specialists are responsible for selecting, calibrating, or operating equipment used in the non-destructive testing of products or materials. This task involves technical knowledge and expertise in understanding how different testing equipment works and how to use them effectively. While an LLM could potentially provide information on the basics of non-destructive testing, it may not have the specialized domain knowledge required to calibrate or operate specific testing equipment. The task also involves hands-on work with physical equipment, which cannot be directly replaced by text-based interactions with an LLM. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not clearly benefit from the use of an LLM to reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete the task.
