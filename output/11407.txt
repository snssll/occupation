1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of performing construction laborer duties at green building sites, such as renewable energy plants or wind turbine installations, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be impacted by the use of the LLM.

- Construction laborer duties involve physical work at construction sites, such as lifting heavy materials, operating machinery, and performing manual labor. These tasks require hands-on skills and cannot be directly replaced by text-based interactions with the LLM.
- While the LLM could potentially provide information on green building practices, renewable energy technologies, or safety guidelines, the task of physically performing laborer duties is not something that can be significantly expedited or improved by the LLM alone.
- The task does not involve complex text-based instructions, writing, summarizing documents, or any other text-heavy activities that the LLM excels at. It primarily requires physical presence and manual work.

Based on these considerations, the task of performing construction laborer duties at green building sites would be classified as E0 - No exposure to the LLM.
