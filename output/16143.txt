1: In this task, a Furnace, Kiln, Oven, Drier, and Kettle Operator and Tender is required to sprinkle chemicals on the surface of molten metal to bring impurities to the surface and remove them using strainers. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if access to the LLM or LLM-powered tools can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality.

Given the nature of the task, which involves physical interaction with molten metal and chemicals, it is clear that the task falls under the E0 category. This task requires hands-on work and poses potential safety hazards, making it unsuitable for automation or assistance from an LLM.

2: E0

3: High
