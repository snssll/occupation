1: In this task, the occupation involves moving equipment, poultry, or livestock from one location to another, either manually or using trucks or carts. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality by at least half.

- The task involves physical labor and manual handling of equipment, poultry, or livestock, which cannot be directly assisted by the LLM.
- The task does not involve complex decision-making, analysis, or specialized knowledge that would benefit from the LLM's capabilities.
- The task does not require text input or output, making it unsuitable for direct interaction with the LLM.
- There are no aspects of the task that could be automated or improved by software built on top of the LLM.

Based on these considerations, the task of moving equipment, poultry, or livestock from one location to another does not have any exposure to the LLM's capabilities and falls under label E0.
