1: In this task, the Orderlies are responsible for stocking utility rooms, nonmedical storage rooms, or cleaning carts with supplies. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. This task involves straightforward instructions that can be easily understood and executed by an average worker. The task does not require specialized domain knowledge or complex decision-making. The task primarily involves manual labor and organization skills.

Given that the task does not involve complex data analysis, specialized knowledge retrieval, or detailed documentation, it is unlikely that access to the LLM would significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task. The task is more about physical organization and manual work rather than information processing or decision-making that could benefit from the LLM's capabilities. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as the LLM would not provide a substantial time-saving advantage for an experienced worker completing this task.
