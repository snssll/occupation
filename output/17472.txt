1: In this task, the Software Quality Assurance Analysts and Testers need to update automated test scripts to ensure they are current. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we can break down the task:
- The task involves working with text (automated test scripts) and updating them based on the latest information.
- The task requires understanding the current state of the test scripts and making necessary modifications to keep them up to date.
- The task does not involve complex visual or image processing, precise measurements, or physical interactions.

Given that the task primarily involves working with text and updating scripts based on current information, the most suitable exposure label would be E1. The task can be significantly expedited by using the LLM to assist in updating and modifying the test scripts efficiently.

2: E1
