1: In this task, an Insulation Worker is responsible for preparing surfaces for insulation application by performing various activities such as brushing or spreading adhesives, cement, or asphalt, and attaching metal pins to surfaces. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it.

- E0: This task involves physical actions such as brushing, spreading adhesives, and attaching metal pins, which cannot be directly performed by the LLM or any software tool. The task also requires hands-on work that cannot be replaced by text-based instructions or information provided by the LLM.

- E1: While the LLM could potentially provide information on the types of adhesives, cement, or asphalt to use for insulation, as well as safety guidelines for preparing surfaces, the actual physical actions involved in preparing surfaces cannot be directly performed by the LLM. Therefore, the LLM alone would not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task.

- E2: It is conceivable that specialized software could be developed on top of the LLM that provides detailed instructions on surface preparation techniques, safety protocols, and material recommendations specific to different insulation applications. This software could potentially streamline the process by offering tailored guidance based on the input provided by the worker.

- E3: The task does not involve image processing or detailed visual instructions that would require image capabilities in addition to text-based information. Therefore, exposure to image capabilities would not significantly impact the completion of this task.
