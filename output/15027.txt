1: In this task, a Career/Technical Education Teacher at the postsecondary level is required to review enrollment applications and correspond with applicants to obtain additional information. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- Direct exposure (E1): The task involves reviewing written applications and corresponding with applicants, which can be effectively handled by an LLM to draft responses, ask clarifying questions, and provide information. The LLM can assist in composing emails, summarizing application details, and generating follow-up questions based on the application content. This task aligns well with the capabilities of an LLM in handling written communication and document review.

- Exposure by LLM-powered applications (E2): While the task may not require highly specialized domain knowledge or complex databases, it could benefit from additional software that integrates with the LLM to streamline the process further. For instance, an application that can automatically extract key information from applications, suggest responses based on templates, or provide insights into common applicant queries could enhance efficiency.

- Exposure given image capabilities (E3): Image capabilities are not relevant for this task as it primarily involves reviewing text-based enrollment applications and corresponding via written communication. There is no need for image processing or analysis in this context.

Considering the above points, the task of reviewing enrollment applications and corresponding with applicants is best categorized as E1 - Direct exposure.
