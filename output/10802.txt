1: In this task, the occupation of Potters, Manufacturing involves operating jigger machines to form ceramic ware. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality by at least half. Since this task involves physical manipulation of machinery and materials, it does not seem like the LLM or any LLM-powered tool can directly assist in operating jigger machines or forming ceramic ware. The task is hands-on and requires manual skills that cannot be replaced by text-based AI tools. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not benefit from LLM exposure.
