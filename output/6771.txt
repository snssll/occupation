1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of experimenting with different types of dancers, steps, dances, and placements as a choreographer, we need to consider how the task can benefit from the use of a large language model (LLM).

- E0: This task involves hands-on experimentation and interaction with dancers to test ideas and receive feedback. It does not primarily involve written or spoken communication that could be significantly enhanced by an LLM.

- E1: While an LLM could potentially assist in documenting feedback or providing suggestions for dance steps, the core of the task involves physical experimentation and feedback from dancers, which cannot be directly replaced by an LLM.

- E2: It is conceivable that an application could be developed to help choreographers analyze feedback data, suggest new dance steps based on trends, or provide insights into dance placements. However, the physical experimentation and interaction with dancers would still be a crucial aspect of the task.

- E3: The task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images, so the image capabilities of an LLM would not significantly impact the completion of this task.

Based on the analysis, the most fitting label for this task is E2.

2: E2

3: Moderate
