1: In this task, the First-Line Supervisors of Gambling Services Workers are required to evaluate workers' performance and prepare written performance evaluations. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

Firstly, evaluating workers' performance involves assessing various aspects such as productivity, quality of work, adherence to policies, and interpersonal skills. This task requires analyzing and synthesizing information to provide an accurate assessment.

Secondly, preparing written performance evaluations involves effectively communicating the evaluation findings in a clear and concise manner. This requires strong writing skills to convey feedback constructively and professionally.

Given that the task involves analyzing information, synthesizing data, and writing detailed evaluations, the LLM could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task. The LLM can assist in generating performance evaluation templates, providing suggestions for improvement, and even drafting sections of the evaluations based on input criteria.
