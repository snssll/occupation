1: In this task, a helper carpenter is required to fasten timbers or lumber with various materials like glue, screws, pegs, or nails and install hardware. This task involves physical work and manual labor that cannot be directly assisted by an LLM. The process of fastening timbers and installing hardware requires hands-on skills, precision, and knowledge of carpentry techniques. The LLM does not have the capability to physically manipulate objects or perform tasks that involve precise measurements or physical labor. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM or any tools built on top of it.
