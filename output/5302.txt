1: In this task, a Mechanical Engineering Technologist or Technician is required to devise, fabricate, or assemble new or modified mechanical components for various products. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves a significant amount of technical knowledge and expertise in mechanical engineering. While the LLM can provide general information and potentially assist with generating text-based instructions or summaries related to mechanical engineering concepts, it may not have the specialized domain knowledge required to devise, fabricate, or assemble mechanical components accurately. The task also involves hands-on work and precise measurements, which are not within the capabilities of the LLM. Therefore, the task falls under E0 as it requires specialized domain knowledge, hands-on skills, and precise measurements that the LLM alone cannot provide.
