1: In this task, a Maintenance and Repair Worker is required to inspect used parts to determine changes in dimensional requirements using measuring instruments. The task involves precise measurements and requires hands-on interaction with physical objects. The task does not involve writing, summarizing, or analyzing text, which are typical tasks that can benefit from LLM capabilities. Since the task is focused on physical measurements and does not involve text-based analysis, it is unlikely that access to the LLM would significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM.

2: E0
