1: In this task, a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Technologist is responsible for attaching physiological monitoring leads to a patient's body parts before conducting an MRI scan. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be impacted by the use of a large language model (LLM).

- E0: This task involves physical interaction with the patient, which cannot be replaced by text-based interactions with an LLM. The task requires hands-on skills and direct contact with the patient, making it unsuitable for automation using LLM technology.
