1: In this task, a restaurant cook is required to inspect and clean food preparation areas to ensure safe and sanitary food-handling practices. With the help of the LLM, the task could potentially involve generating checklists for inspection, providing guidelines on proper cleaning procedures, and offering suggestions for maintaining sanitation standards. The LLM could also assist in summarizing relevant food safety regulations and best practices for cleaning food preparation areas. However, since this task primarily involves physical inspection and cleaning, which cannot be directly automated by the LLM, it falls under E0.
