1: In this task, the Signal and Track Switch Repairers are responsible for cleaning the lenses of lamps with cloths and solvents. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone or with additional software could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality. 

- E0: This task involves physical cleaning of lenses with cloths and solvents, which cannot be automated by the LLM or any software tool. The task does not involve complex decision-making or specialized knowledge that the LLM could assist with.
- E1: The task does not involve writing, transforming text, summarizing documents, or any other text-related activities that the LLM could directly assist with. The cleaning process is manual and does not require text-based input or output.
- E2: While it is conceivable that specialized software could be developed to automate the cleaning process, the task itself is straightforward and does not involve complex data analysis or decision-making that would benefit significantly from LLM-powered applications.
- E3: The task does not involve image processing, reading text from PDFs, or creating/editing digital images, so the image capabilities of the LLM are not relevant here.

Based on the above analysis, the most appropriate label for this task is E0.

2: E0

3: High
