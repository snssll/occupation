1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of performing failure, variation, or root cause analyses as an Automotive Engineer, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves analyzing data, identifying patterns, and determining the underlying causes of issues in automotive systems. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM can assist in writing reports, summarizing data, and providing insights based on the information provided. It can help in organizing and structuring the analysis process by generating potential causes or suggesting areas to investigate further. However, the LLM may not have the specific domain knowledge required for in-depth automotive engineering analyses.
- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not have all the specialized knowledge needed for automotive engineering analyses, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to access and analyze vast amounts of data, provide recommendations, and assist in identifying trends or correlations that could lead to root cause determination.
- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Since the task does not involve detailed visual analysis or require image processing capabilities, the use of image capabilities provided by the LLM would not significantly impact the analysis of failure, variation, or root cause in automotive engineering.
