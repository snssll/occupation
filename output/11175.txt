1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of "Participate in campus and community events" for various postsecondary teachers, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be completed using the capabilities of the LLM. 

- E1: If the task involves writing about campus and community events, coordinating participation, or providing information related to these events, the LLM could significantly reduce the time needed to draft communications, announcements, or summaries of the events. The LLM could also assist in generating responses to inquiries about the events or drafting emails related to participation.

- E2: If the task requires analyzing data related to past events, making recommendations for future events based on feedback, or preparing detailed reports on event participation, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to streamline these processes. This software could help in summarizing feedback, generating insights from event data, or creating comprehensive event reports.

- E3: If the task involves creating visual materials for promoting events, such as designing posters, flyers, or digital images for event announcements, the LLM's image capabilities could be utilized to assist in this aspect. The LLM could help in generating text for promotional materials or providing captions for event images.
