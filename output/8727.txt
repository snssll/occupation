1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of labeling and sealing graded products and issuing official grading certificates as an Agricultural Inspector, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it.

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** The task involves a straightforward and well-defined process of labeling and sealing graded products and issuing official grading certificates. The LLM could assist in generating the text for the labels and certificates based on predefined criteria and templates. It can also help in ensuring the accuracy and consistency of the information provided. Overall, the task can be significantly streamlined by using the LLM to handle the text generation aspect of the task.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the LLM alone can streamline the text generation part of the task, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to automate the entire process further. This software could potentially integrate with databases of product information, grading criteria, and certification templates to generate the labels and certificates automatically based on the input data. This would require more specialized development beyond the capabilities of the LLM alone.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** This task does not involve image processing or detailed visual information, so the image capabilities of the LLM would not significantly impact the completion of the task.

Based on the above analysis, the task of labeling and sealing graded products and issuing official grading certificates as an Agricultural Inspector is best classified as **E1 (Direct exposure)**.
