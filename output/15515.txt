1: In this task, the worker needs to select machine tooling based on their knowledge of the machine and production requirements. This task involves decision-making based on specific criteria and expertise in the field of metal and plastic machining. The LLM could potentially assist by providing information on different types of machine tooling, their characteristics, and how they align with production requirements. The LLM could also help in generating recommendations based on input criteria. However, since this task requires specialized domain knowledge and expertise in machining, the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with high quality. While additional software could potentially be developed to provide recommendations based on specific inputs, the complexity of the task and the need for specialized knowledge make it less likely that the LLM alone would reduce the time by half.
