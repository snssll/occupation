1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of reading technical literature and participating in continuing education for Clinical Data Managers in relation to exposure to LLM, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- Reading technical literature involves processing and understanding complex information, which an LLM can assist with by summarizing key points, providing insights, or generating questions for further exploration.
- Participating in continuing education may involve staying up-to-date with the latest trends and practices in database technology, which an LLM can help with by retrieving relevant information, analyzing trends, and providing recommendations based on the data.

Given that the task involves staying informed about current database technology and best practices, an LLM could significantly reduce the time it takes to gather and process this information by summarizing key points, providing insights, and generating questions for further exploration. Therefore, this task falls under E1 as direct access to the LLM can enhance the efficiency and quality of completing the task.
