1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of cutting, shaping, and forming metal parts as a Model Maker, Metal and Plastic, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves physical manipulation of metal parts using various tools, which cannot be directly assisted by the LLM. The LLM does not have the ability to perform physical tasks or interact with physical objects. Therefore, this task does not fall under E1, E2, or E3 categories as the LLM cannot reduce the time it takes to complete the task.
