1: In this task of explaining and calculating parking charges, collecting fees, and responding to customer complaints as a Parking Attendant, the exposure to LLM can be evaluated as follows:

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** The task involves a lot of written communication with customers, explaining charges, and responding to complaints. The LLM can assist in generating responses to common complaints, drafting emails or messages to explain charges, and even calculating fees based on specific criteria provided. The model can also help in maintaining records of transactions and complaints. Overall, the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete these written tasks with equivalent quality.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the LLM alone can handle a significant portion of the task, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to further streamline processes. For example, a specialized application could integrate with the LLM to retrieve specific parking charge information, provide real-time updates on parking availability, or even suggest responses based on historical data of customer complaints. Such software could enhance the efficiency of the Parking Attendant's tasks.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Image capabilities are not directly relevant to the task of explaining and calculating parking charges, collecting fees, and responding to customer complaints. Therefore, this task does not fall under E3.
