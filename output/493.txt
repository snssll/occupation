1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of analyzing and reporting computer network security breaches or attempted breaches as a Computer Network Support Specialist, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. 

- The task involves analyzing and reporting on specific incidents related to computer network security breaches. The LLM can assist in providing general information on cybersecurity practices, common types of breaches, and potential solutions.
- The LLM can help in summarizing information related to cybersecurity incidents and generating reports based on the input data provided.
- While the LLM can provide general guidance and information, it may not have access to real-time data on specific breaches unless that information is included in the input.
- The task does not involve detailed technical analysis or investigation that may require specialized domain knowledge beyond what the LLM can provide.

Based on these considerations, the task falls under E1 as the LLM can assist in summarizing information, generating reports, and providing general guidance on cybersecurity incidents, thereby reducing the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality.
