1: In this task, a Geodetic Surveyor is required to stay updated on developments in technology, equipment, or systems by reading current literature, talking with colleagues, continuing education, or participating in professional organizations or conferences. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be significantly expedited or improved by using the LLM. The LLM could potentially assist in summarizing large amounts of literature quickly, providing insights from various sources, generating questions for further research, or even suggesting relevant conferences or organizations based on the latest information available. However, since the task involves staying updated on real-time developments, the LLM may not have access to the most current information unless it is explicitly provided in the input. Therefore, while the LLM can aid in some aspects of research and information gathering, it may not significantly reduce the time it takes to stay abreast of the latest developments in this field.
