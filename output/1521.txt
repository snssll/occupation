1: In this task of binding new books using hand tools, the process involves manual dexterity and physical manipulation of tools to create a finished product. The task does not involve text input or output that can be directly processed by an LLM. While an LLM could potentially provide information on bookbinding techniques or tools, it cannot physically bind books using hand tools. Therefore, the task does not align with any of the exposure levels in the rubric.
