1: In this task, the occupation of Bridge and Lock Tenders involves stopping automobile and pedestrian traffic on bridges and lowering automobile gates before moving the bridges. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone or additional software could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality. Since this task involves physical actions such as stopping traffic and lowering gates, it does not seem feasible for the LLM or any software built on top of it to directly assist in completing the task. The task requires real-time physical intervention and cannot be automated through text-based instructions or responses. Therefore, the task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM or any software that could be developed on top of it.

2: E0
