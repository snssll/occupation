1: For the task of cleaning, finishing, and lubricating molds and mold parts, the exposure to LLM can be evaluated as follows:

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** The task involves specific instructions related to cleaning, finishing, and lubricating molds and mold parts. The LLM can assist in providing detailed step-by-step instructions on how to perform these tasks effectively. It can generate text on the proper techniques, tools, and materials needed for cleaning, finishing, and lubricating molds. The LLM can also help in troubleshooting common issues that may arise during the process.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the LLM alone can provide guidance on the task, additional software could be developed to enhance the process further. For example, a specialized application could be created that includes visual aids or interactive guides to demonstrate the cleaning, finishing, and lubricating processes. This application could integrate real-time feedback based on user input and provide customized recommendations based on the specific type of mold or material being worked on.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Image capabilities may not significantly impact the task of cleaning, finishing, and lubricating molds and mold parts. While visual aids could potentially assist in demonstrating certain techniques, the task primarily involves manual labor and hands-on work rather than relying heavily on visual information.
