1: In this task, a Zoologist or Wildlife Biologist is responsible for checking for compliance with environmental laws and notifying law enforcement of any violations. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves understanding and applying environmental laws, which may require referencing specific legal statutes and regulations. The LLM can provide information on existing laws and regulations related to wildlife and the environment, helping the zoologist or biologist understand the legal requirements.
- The LLM can also assist in drafting reports or notifications to law enforcement by providing guidance on how to effectively communicate violations.
- However, the task also involves practical fieldwork and observation to identify violations, which cannot be directly performed by the LLM.
- While the LLM can provide information and guidance, the final decision to notify law enforcement may require human judgment based on the specific circumstances of the violation.

Based on these considerations, the task falls under E2 - Exposure by LLM-powered applications. While the LLM can assist in providing information and drafting reports, additional software or tools would be needed to streamline the process further, such as integrating real-time data on environmental violations or automating the notification process.
