1: In this task, a customs broker is responsible for clearing goods through customs and ensuring they reach their destinations for clients. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves dealing with customs procedures, regulations, and documentation, which can be complex and require knowledge of specific rules and requirements. The task also involves communication with customs officials, clients, and possibly other parties involved in the shipping process. 

Given that the task involves a combination of understanding regulations, documentation, and communication, an LLM could potentially assist in providing information on customs procedures, regulations, and documentation requirements. The LLM could also help in drafting communication with customs officials or clients. However, the task may also require real-time interaction, decision-making based on specific circumstances, and handling unexpected issues that may not be easily addressed by an LLM alone. 

Considering these factors, the task could potentially benefit from the use of an LLM to provide information and support in certain aspects of the customs clearance process, but it may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with high quality. Therefore, this task falls under the E2 exposure label, as additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to streamline certain aspects of the customs clearance process.
