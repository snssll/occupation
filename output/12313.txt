1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of preparing and delivering lectures to undergraduate or graduate students as an Anthropology and Archeology Teacher, Postsecondary, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The task involves writing and delivering lectures on specific topics within anthropology and archeology. The LLM could assist in generating lecture content, providing insights on research methods, urban anthropology, language, and culture. It could help in structuring the lectures, providing examples, and even suggesting engaging ways to present the material. The LLM's ability to generate text and information could significantly reduce the time needed to prepare lectures while maintaining quality.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone can assist in generating lecture content, additional software could be developed to summarize research papers, provide up-to-date information on the topics, and even create interactive lecture materials. Such software could further enhance the efficiency of preparing and delivering lectures in a postsecondary setting.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities would not significantly impact the task of preparing and delivering lectures in this context. The task primarily involves creating and delivering textual content to students, which can be effectively handled by the LLM without the need for image capabilities.
