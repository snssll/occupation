1: In this task, a Milling and Planing Machine Setter, Operator, or Tender needs to compute dimensions, tolerances, and angles of workpieces or machines based on specifications and knowledge of metal properties and shop mathematics. To complete this task, the worker would typically need to have a deep understanding of metal properties, shop mathematics, and technical specifications. The task involves complex calculations and precise measurements, which are not directly related to text-based information processing. While an LLM could potentially assist with providing information on metal properties or shop mathematics, it would not significantly reduce the time it takes to compute dimensions, tolerances, and angles of workpieces or machines. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as the LLM would not decrease the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete the task with high quality by at least half.
