1: In this task, a Patternmaker, Wood is responsible for selecting lumber to be used for patterns. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if access to the LLM or LLM-powered tools can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete the task with high quality by at least half.

- The task of selecting lumber for patterns involves a physical aspect that cannot be directly addressed by the LLM, as it requires the worker to assess the quality, type, and suitability of the wood in person.
- While the LLM could potentially provide information on different types of wood or offer guidance on selecting lumber based on certain criteria, the physical nature of the task itself cannot be replaced by the LLM.
- Additionally, the task does not involve complex text input or output that the LLM could directly assist with, as it primarily requires hands-on assessment and decision-making based on physical attributes of the lumber.
