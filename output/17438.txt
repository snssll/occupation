1: In this task, a Teaching Assistant is required to tutor and assist children individually or in small groups to help them master assignments and reinforce learning concepts presented by teachers. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves providing personalized assistance to students, which may require adapting to individual learning styles and needs. The LLM could potentially assist in generating personalized learning materials, providing explanations, or even creating practice assignments tailored to each student. However, the task also involves direct interaction with students, understanding their emotional and educational needs, and providing support beyond just academic assistance. While the LLM could help with generating some materials, it cannot replace the human touch and empathy needed in this role. Therefore, the task falls under E0 as the LLM alone cannot significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced Teaching Assistant to complete the task with high quality.
