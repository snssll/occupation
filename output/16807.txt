1: In order to determine the appropriate label for the task of teaching medical dosimetry to students, radiation therapists, or residents, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be impacted by the use of the LLM. 

- Teaching medical dosimetry involves conveying complex information, providing explanations, and potentially answering questions from students. The LLM can assist in generating educational materials, explanations, and even answering questions related to medical dosimetry.
- The LLM can help in preparing training materials based on general knowledge about medical dosimetry, which can be used in the teaching process.
- While the LLM can provide information and explanations, it may not significantly reduce the time it takes to teach the subject compared to a human instructor. The interactive and personalized nature of teaching may require human input and adaptation to the students' needs.

Based on these considerations, the task of teaching medical dosimetry is likely to fall under E2 - Exposure by LLM-powered applications. While the LLM can assist in generating educational materials and explanations, the interactive and adaptive nature of teaching may not be significantly expedited by the LLM alone.
