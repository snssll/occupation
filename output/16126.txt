1: In this task, a Laundry and Dry-Cleaning Worker is required to spray steam, water, or air over spots to perform various cleaning and brightening tasks on garments. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be significantly expedited or improved by using the language model. Since this task involves physical actions such as spraying and requires hands-on work with garments, it does not seem like the LLM can directly assist in completing the task. The task does not involve complex decision-making, data analysis, or written communication that would benefit from the capabilities of the LLM. Therefore, based on the nature of the task, it is unlikely that the LLM can reduce the time it takes to complete this task significantly.
