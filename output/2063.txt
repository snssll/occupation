1: In this task, the worker is required to clean or sterilize various equipment and areas using different tools and methods. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be significantly aided by the use of the language model. The task involves physical actions such as using hoses, brushes, scrapers, and chemical solutions, which cannot be directly replaced by text-based instructions or responses from the LLM. While the LLM could potentially provide information on the best cleaning practices or chemical solutions, the core aspect of physically cleaning and sterilizing equipment cannot be directly assisted by the model. Therefore, the task does not align with the capabilities of the LLM to a significant extent.
