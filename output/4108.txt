1: In this task, an Automotive Body and Related Repairer is required to cut openings in vehicle bodies for the installation of customized windows. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if the task can be significantly expedited or improved by using the LLM. 

- The task involves physical work that cannot be directly replaced by text-based instructions or responses from the LLM.
- The task requires specialized skills and knowledge related to automotive repair, which the LLM may not possess.
- The task involves precise measurements and physical tools like power shears or chisels, which cannot be operated by the LLM.

Based on these considerations, it is clear that the task of cutting openings in vehicle bodies for customized windows does not lend itself to automation or assistance by the LLM. Therefore, the appropriate label for this task is E0.

2: E0

3: High
