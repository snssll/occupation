1: In this task, an Educational, Guidance, and Career Counselor is required to observe students during classroom and play activities to evaluate various aspects of their development. To complete this task, the counselor needs to physically be present in the classroom or play area to directly observe the students. This task involves real-time observation, interaction with students, and the ability to assess non-verbal cues and behaviors. Since the task requires physical presence and direct interaction with students, it cannot be effectively completed using the LLM or any software tool based on it. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not benefit from exposure to the LLM.
