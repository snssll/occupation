1: In this task, a Crematory Operator is responsible for sweeping or vacuuming the cremation chamber to retrieve remains for storage. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality. 

- The task involves physical actions such as sweeping or vacuuming, which cannot be directly assisted by the LLM.
- The task does not involve complex text input or output that the LLM could assist with.
- The task does not require specialized knowledge or up-to-date information that the LLM could provide.

Based on these considerations, it is clear that the task of sweeping or vacuuming the cremation chamber does not align with any of the exposure labels provided. The LLM cannot assist in physical tasks or tasks that do not involve text input or output.
