1: In this task, a Helper-Roofer is responsible for clearing drains, downspouts, and cleaning gutters. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be aided by the LLM. 

- The task involves physical work that cannot be directly assisted by the LLM, such as climbing ladders and physically clearing debris from gutters. 
- While the LLM could potentially provide information on the best practices for gutter cleaning or safety guidelines, the actual execution of the task requires physical presence and manual labor.
- The LLM cannot physically interact with the environment to clear drains or clean gutters, making it unsuitable for direct assistance in this task.
- Additionally, the task does not involve complex decision-making, specialized domain knowledge, or detailed data analysis that would benefit significantly from LLM capabilities.

Based on these considerations, the task of clearing drains, downspouts, and cleaning gutters for Helpers-Roofers would be classified as E0, as the LLM cannot reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete the task with high quality by at least half.
