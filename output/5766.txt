1: In this task, a tour guide or escort is required to distribute brochures, show audiovisual presentations, and explain establishment processes and operations at tour sites. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- Distributing brochures: The LLM could potentially assist in generating text for brochures or providing information to include in them, but the physical act of distributing them would still require human intervention. 
- Showing audiovisual presentations: The LLM could help in creating scripts for presentations or providing information to include, but the actual showing of the presentations would need a human to operate the equipment.
- Explaining establishment processes and operations: The LLM could assist in generating scripts or information to explain processes, but the delivery and interaction with tourists would require human presence and adaptability.

Given that the task involves a significant amount of physical interaction, presence, and adaptability, it is unlikely that the LLM alone could reduce the time it takes to complete the task by at least half. Therefore, this task falls under E0.
