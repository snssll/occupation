1: In this task, a special education teaching assistant is required to laminate teaching materials to increase their durability under repeated use. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The task of laminating teaching materials involves a physical action of using a laminating machine to encase materials in a protective layer. This task does not involve writing, summarizing, translating, or any other text-based activities that the LLM excels at. Therefore, direct access to the LLM would not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While it is conceivable that a specialized software could be developed to assist in the process of laminating teaching materials, such a tool would likely involve physical automation or specialized hardware rather than text-based capabilities of the LLM. The LLM alone would not be able to significantly enhance the efficiency of laminating materials.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - The task of laminating teaching materials does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images. It is a physical task that does not rely on image processing capabilities. Therefore, access to image capabilities would not significantly impact the completion of this task.
