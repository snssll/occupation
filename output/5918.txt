1: In this task, the occupation involves models trying on sample or completed garments and selecting accessories. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM could potentially assist in providing information on current fashion trends, suggesting outfit combinations, or even generating descriptions of how certain garments might look on a model. This could streamline the process of selecting outfits and accessories.
- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not directly reduce the time to complete the task by half, additional software could be developed to provide virtual try-on capabilities, personalized styling recommendations, or real-time feedback on outfit choices.
- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities could enhance the task by allowing for virtual outfit try-ons or creating digital representations of outfit combinations for evaluation.

Considering the task involves trying on garments and selecting accessories, the most fitting label appears to be E2. While the LLM alone may not drastically reduce the time to complete the task, the development of software leveraging the LLM's capabilities could significantly enhance the process.
