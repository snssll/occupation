1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of researching or investigating products to be presented for demonstrations as a Demonstrator and Product Promoter, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be aided by the use of a large language model (LLM).

- E1: Direct exposure - In this case, the task involves researching and investigating products to prepare for demonstrations. An LLM can assist by providing information on product details, features, benefits, and other relevant data. The LLM can help in summarizing product information, comparing different products, and generating insights based on the input provided. This can significantly reduce the time it takes to gather and analyze product information, enhancing the efficiency of the research process.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the task can benefit from the direct use of an LLM, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to further streamline the research process. For example, specialized tools could be created to extract specific product details from various sources, analyze customer reviews, or provide recommendations based on market trends. These applications could enhance the capabilities of the LLM and optimize the product investigation process.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not directly relevant to the task of researching products for demonstrations. Since the task primarily involves text-based research and analysis, image capabilities would not significantly impact the efficiency or quality of completing this task.

Based on the above analysis, the task of researching products to be presented for demonstrations as a Demonstrator and Product Promoter is best classified as E1: Direct exposure.

2: E1

3: Certainty level: High
