1: In this task, the teacher needs to adapt teaching methods and instructional materials to meet students' varying needs and interests. To determine the exposure level, we need to consider if the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes for a teacher to adapt their teaching methods and materials to cater to individual student needs and interests. The LLM can provide suggestions for different teaching strategies, recommend resources, and even generate customized instructional materials based on the specific needs and interests of students. This can save time for the teacher in brainstorming and researching different approaches. However, the task also involves a high degree of human interaction, understanding of individual student needs, and practical application in a classroom setting, which may not be fully replaceable by the LLM. Therefore, while the LLM can assist in generating ideas and materials, the actual implementation and adaptation process may still heavily rely on the teacher's expertise and experience.
