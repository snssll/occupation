1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of selecting applicants meeting specified job requirements and referring them to hiring personnel as a Human Resources Assistant, I will consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves reviewing job requirements, evaluating applicant qualifications, and making decisions on who to refer for further consideration. The LLM can assist in this task by providing guidance on evaluating qualifications, suggesting criteria for selection, and even drafting referral emails based on the job requirements and applicant profiles. This task primarily involves text input and output, which the LLM is proficient at handling within a 2000-word context.

Considering the task's nature and the LLM's ability to assist in writing and transforming text, providing feedback on documents, and making recommendations based on data, it is evident that the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality. Therefore, this task falls under the E1 label as direct access to the LLM can streamline the process of selecting and referring applicants.
