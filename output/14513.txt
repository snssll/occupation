1: In this task, the farmworker is required to repair farm buildings, fences, and other structures. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes for an average worker to complete this task with equivalent quality. Repairing farm buildings, fences, and structures involves physical work, manual labor, and technical skills that cannot be directly assisted by the LLM. The task does not involve writing, transforming text, or complex instructions that the LLM could assist with. Therefore, the task does not fall under E1. Additionally, developing software on top of the LLM to perform physical repairs is not feasible, so it does not fit under E2. The task also does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images, so it does not align with E3. Overall, the task of repairing farm buildings, fences, and structures does not have a clear way for the LLM to assist in reducing the time it takes to complete the task.
