1: In this task, a Radiologic Technologist or Technician is required to perform various medical imaging procedures under the supervision of a physician. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves hands-on medical procedures that require physical interaction with patients and specialized medical equipment. The task also involves making real-time decisions based on patient conditions and imaging results, which cannot be solely reliant on text-based information. As such, the task does not involve writing, summarizing documents, or providing feedback on written materials that could be significantly enhanced by an LLM. Therefore, the task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM to reduce the time it takes to complete the task significantly.
