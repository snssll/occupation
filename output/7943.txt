1: In this task of inspecting or testing parts to determine defects or malfunctions as an Automotive Engineering Technician, the use of an LLM could potentially provide assistance in several ways. The LLM could help in providing information on common defects or malfunctions in automotive parts, suggest troubleshooting steps based on historical data or manuals, or even assist in generating reports based on the inspection results. However, since this task involves hands-on work with physical parts and may require precise measurements or detailed visual inspections, the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task. While the LLM could provide some guidance or information, the core of the task still relies heavily on practical skills and experience.
