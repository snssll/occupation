1: In this task, a Law Teacher, Postsecondary is responsible for assigning cases for students to hear and try. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves selecting and assigning legal cases for students to work on, which requires knowledge of legal principles, case law, and educational objectives. While an LLM could potentially assist in generating a list of relevant cases based on specific criteria provided, the task also involves a level of judgment and expertise that may not be easily automated. The LLM could help in researching and suggesting cases, but the final decision-making process may still heavily rely on the teacher's expertise and understanding of the educational context. Therefore, this task falls under E2 - Exposure by LLM-powered applications, as additional software could be developed to assist in the case selection process, but the task itself may not be significantly reduced in time by just using the LLM.
