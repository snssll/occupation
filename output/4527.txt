1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of designing, programming, or modeling Geographic Information Systems (GIS) applications or procedures, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be impacted by the use of a large language model (LLM).

- E0: This task involves specialized knowledge and skills related to GIS applications and procedures. While an LLM can provide general information about GIS and potentially assist with writing related documentation or reports, the core task of designing, programming, or modeling GIS applications requires specific technical expertise that goes beyond what an LLM can provide. The task also does not involve direct text-based interactions that can be significantly enhanced by an LLM.

- E1: While an LLM could potentially assist in generating some text-based content related to GIS applications or procedures, the core aspects of designing, programming, or modeling GIS systems are highly technical and specialized. The task involves complex problem-solving, data analysis, and software development skills that cannot be fully replaced or significantly expedited by an LLM alone.

- E2: It is conceivable that additional software tools could be developed on top of an LLM to assist with certain aspects of GIS application design or modeling. For example, such tools could help with data analysis, report generation, or providing recommendations based on input data. However, the fundamental technical work of designing and programming GIS applications would still require specialized knowledge and skills beyond what an LLM can offer.

- E3: The task of designing, programming, or modeling GIS applications does not directly involve image processing or creation, so the additional capabilities provided by image-related tools would not significantly impact the completion of this task.
