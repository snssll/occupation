1: In this task, the occupation of a Travel Guide involves administering first aid to injured group participants. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone or with additional software could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality.

- E0: This task involves physical actions that require hands-on skills and immediate response, such as administering first aid. The LLM cannot physically administer first aid, and this task cannot be completed solely through text-based interactions.

- E1: The LLM could potentially provide information on first aid procedures, but it cannot physically administer aid. While it could offer guidance on what to do in certain situations, the actual administration of first aid requires practical skills and physical presence, which the LLM cannot provide.

- E2: While the LLM could potentially provide information on first aid procedures and guidelines, it cannot physically administer aid. However, additional software could be developed to provide real-time guidance based on the information provided by the LLM. This software could potentially assist in guiding individuals on how to administer first aid effectively.

- E3: The task does not involve image capabilities that would significantly impact the completion time. Therefore, this task does not fall under E3.

2: E2

3: Moderate
