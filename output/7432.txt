1: In this task, a Healthcare Social Worker is required to identify environmental impediments to client or patient progress through interviews and review of patient records. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes for a Healthcare Social Worker to complete this task with high quality. 

- The task involves analyzing patient records and conducting interviews to identify environmental impediments, which requires a deep understanding of the patient's situation and context.
- The LLM can assist in providing general information about environmental factors that may impact patient progress, but it may not have access to specific patient records or the ability to conduct interviews.
- While the LLM can provide general guidance or information on common environmental impediments, the specific and nuanced nature of this task may require human judgment and expertise.
- The task involves a level of interpretation and analysis that may be challenging for the LLM to replicate accurately without human input.

Based on these considerations, the task falls under E0 as the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time it takes for a Healthcare Social Worker to complete this task with high quality.
