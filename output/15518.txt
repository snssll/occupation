1: In this task, an Orthotist or Prosthetist is required to select materials and components based on device design. To complete this task, the professional needs to have a deep understanding of the materials and components available in the market, their properties, and how they align with the specific design requirements of the orthotic or prosthetic device. The task involves a level of expertise and knowledge that is not readily available in a general-purpose large language model (LLM). While the LLM could potentially provide some general information on materials and components, the specific selection process based on device design requires specialized domain knowledge that goes beyond what the LLM can offer. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not significantly benefit from the capabilities of the LLM.
