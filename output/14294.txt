1: In this task, a Cabinetmaker or Bench Carpenter is required to reinforce joints with nails or other fasteners to prepare articles for finishing. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone or with additional software could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality.

- E0: This task involves physical work that cannot be directly replaced by text-based instructions or information provided by the LLM. The task requires manual dexterity and physical interaction with materials, making it unsuitable for automation through the LLM.

- E1: While the LLM could potentially provide information on different types of joints, fasteners, or finishing techniques, it cannot physically reinforce joints with nails or other fasteners. The task is hands-on and requires practical skills that cannot be replicated through text-based instructions alone.

- E2: It is challenging to imagine additional software built on top of the LLM that could automate the physical act of reinforcing joints with nails or other fasteners. This task is highly specialized and requires manual craftsmanship that goes beyond the capabilities of text-based or AI-driven tools.

- E3: The task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images. It is primarily a manual task that does not benefit significantly from image capabilities.
