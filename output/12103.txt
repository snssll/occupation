1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of planning, scheduling, or coordinating construction project activities to meet deadlines as a Construction Manager, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves organizing and managing various aspects of a construction project to ensure timely completion. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM can assist in creating detailed project plans, scheduling tasks, and coordinating activities by providing text-based guidance and recommendations. It can help in drafting communication materials, such as emails or reports, related to project progress and deadlines. The LLM can also generate ideas for optimizing project timelines based on input criteria.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time to complete the task, additional software could be developed to integrate the LLM's capabilities with project management tools. This software could automate certain aspects of project planning and scheduling, provide real-time updates on project status, and offer data-driven insights for decision-making.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not directly relevant to the task of planning, scheduling, or coordinating construction project activities to meet deadlines. This task primarily involves text-based information and coordination rather than visual content.

Based on the above analysis, the task of planning, scheduling, or coordinating construction project activities to meet deadlines as a Construction Manager aligns best with **E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications**.
