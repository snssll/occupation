1: In this task, an Advanced Practice Psychiatric Nurse evaluates patients' behavior to formulate diagnoses or assess treatments. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we can break down the task as follows:

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** The task involves analyzing and interpreting patient behavior to make clinical judgments. While the LLM can provide general information about psychiatric conditions, it may not have the specific expertise or real-time patient interaction capabilities required for accurate diagnosis or treatment assessment. Therefore, direct access to the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** It is conceivable that additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to assist in summarizing patient data, providing treatment recommendations based on existing knowledge, or even offering decision support tools. These applications could potentially enhance the efficiency of evaluating patients' behavior in psychiatric settings. However, the complexity and sensitivity of psychiatric assessments may require specialized domain knowledge beyond what the LLM can provide.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Image capabilities would not significantly impact the evaluation of patients' behavior in this context, as the task primarily involves observing and interpreting behavioral cues rather than analyzing visual data.
