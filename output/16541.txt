1: Non-Destructive Testing Specialists are professionals who inspect, test, and evaluate materials, components, or assemblies for discontinuities, defects, or other imperfections without damaging the tested object. The task provided involves supervising or directing the work of non-destructive testing trainees or staff. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality. In this case, the task involves overseeing and managing the work of individuals, which requires human interaction, decision-making, and real-time assessment of performance. While the LLM can provide information or guidance on non-destructive testing techniques, it cannot replace the need for direct supervision and interaction in a practical setting. Therefore, the task falls under E0 as it does not clearly decrease the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete the task with high quality by at least half.
