1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of gathering information from prospective customers to identify their solar energy needs as a Solar Sales Representative and Assessor, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be facilitated by the use of the LLM.

- The task involves interacting with prospective customers to gather specific information about their solar energy needs. This task primarily requires communication skills, active listening, and the ability to ask relevant questions to understand customer requirements.
- While the LLM can provide general information about solar energy and sales techniques, it may not significantly reduce the time it takes to gather personalized information from individual customers.
- The LLM could potentially assist in generating questions or prompts that the sales representative could use during interactions with customers, but the core task of gathering personalized information would still heavily rely on human interaction and communication skills.
