1: In this task, an Obstetrician and Gynecologist is required to prescribe or administer therapy, medication, and other specialized medical care to treat or prevent illness, disease, or injury. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- E0: This task involves specialized medical knowledge, diagnosis, and treatment decisions that require human expertise, physical examination, and patient interaction. It is not suitable for automation or assistance from an LLM.
- E1: While an LLM could potentially provide information on standard treatment protocols or drug interactions, the core of this task involves making critical medical decisions based on patient-specific information, which cannot be solely reliant on an LLM.
- E2: Developing software on top of an LLM that could assist in suggesting treatment options based on patient data and medical guidelines might be possible. However, the complexity and ethical considerations involved in medical care make it challenging to fully automate this task.
- E3: Image capabilities would not significantly impact the completion of this task as it primarily involves medical decision-making based on patient information rather than visual data.

Based on the above analysis, the most appropriate label for this task is E2.

2: E2

3: Moderate
