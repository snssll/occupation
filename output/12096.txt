1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of planning, preparing, and developing teaching aids, such as bibliographies, charts, and graphs, for Teaching Assistants in schools, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves creating educational materials to support teaching activities, which can be done through text input and output within the 2000-word context limit of the LLM. The LLM can assist in generating text-based content, such as writing descriptions, instructions, or explanations for the teaching aids. It can also help in researching and summarizing information to include in bibliographies. However, the task does not involve complex visual design or detailed graphical work, which may require specialized software beyond the LLM's capabilities. Therefore, the LLM can significantly reduce the time needed to create textual teaching aids but may not cover all aspects of graphical aid development.
