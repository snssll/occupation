1: In this task of sweeping sand into the joints and compacting pavement, there is no direct involvement of text input or output that would benefit significantly from the use of a large language model (LLM). The task is physical and manual, requiring hands-on work to ensure the joints are properly filled. The LLM does not have the capability to physically interact with the pavement or perform the compacting process. Therefore, there is no way for the LLM to directly assist in completing this task.
