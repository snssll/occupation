1: In this task, the Educational, Guidance, and Career Counselors and Advisors need to provide information to teachers and staff members to assist students or graduates in identifying and pursuing employment opportunities. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves providing information and guidance related to employment opportunities, which can be effectively completed using the LLM to generate relevant information, advice, and resources. The LLM can assist in summarizing key points, generating recommendations, and providing insights into the current job market trends. As the task primarily involves written communication and information sharing, the LLM can significantly reduce the time needed to gather and present relevant data to teachers and staff members.
