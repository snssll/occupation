1: In this task, a Sales Engineer is required to report to supervisors about prospective firms' credit ratings. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM can assist in completing it. 

- The task involves analyzing and summarizing information about credit ratings, which can be done by the LLM through text input and output.
- The LLM can help in researching and summarizing credit ratings information for various firms, potentially saving time compared to manual research.
- The LLM can assist in generating reports based on the credit ratings information gathered, providing a structured output for supervisors.
- The task does not involve any visual elements or specialized domain knowledge that would require additional capabilities beyond text processing.

Based on these considerations, the task falls under E1 as the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to research, analyze, and report on prospective firms' credit ratings with equivalent quality.
