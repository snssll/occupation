1: In this task, the Magnetic Resonance Imaging Technologists are required to connect physiological leads to physiological acquisition control (PAC) units. This task involves physical interaction with equipment and requires specific technical knowledge and skills related to medical imaging technology. The task does not involve writing, summarizing text, or any other activity that can be directly performed by an LLM. Additionally, the task does not involve image processing or analysis that could be enhanced by combining LLM capabilities with image capabilities. Therefore, this task does not align with any of the exposure levels in the rubric.
