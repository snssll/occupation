1: In this task, a First-Line Supervisor of Office and Administrative Support Workers is responsible for planning and coordinating various office services. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be significantly aided by the use of the language model. The task involves organizing office services, acquiring supplies, coordinating maintenance, and security services, among other responsibilities. While the LLM can provide information and guidance on general office management practices, it may not significantly reduce the time it takes to plan and coordinate these services, as it requires practical knowledge of office operations and logistics that go beyond text-based information. Therefore, the task does not fall under E1, where direct access to the LLM can reduce the time by at least half. Additionally, developing software on top of the LLM to specifically address the coordination of office services may not be straightforward and may not lead to a significant time reduction. Hence, it does not fit under E2 either. Since the task does not involve image processing or detailed visual analysis, it does not fall under E3. Therefore, the most appropriate label for this task is E0.

2: E0

3: High
