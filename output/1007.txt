1: For the task of arranging tables and decorations according to instructions as a Fast Food and Counter Worker, the exposure to LLM can be evaluated as follows:

- E1: Direct exposure - The task of arranging tables and decorations involves following specific instructions, which can be easily communicated through text input to the LLM. The LLM can provide step-by-step guidance on how to arrange the tables and decorations based on the given instructions, potentially reducing the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality by at least half.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the task may not require complex analysis or specialized domain knowledge that would necessitate additional software beyond the LLM, it is conceivable that a more advanced application could be developed to provide visual representations or 3D models of the desired table and decoration arrangements, further streamlining the process.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - The task does not involve reading text from PDFs or detailed image editing, so the image capabilities of the LLM may not significantly impact the completion of this task.
