1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of conducting research in surveying and mapping methods as a Surveyor, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be aided by the use of a large language model (LLM).

- The task involves conducting research in surveying and mapping methods, which may require accessing and analyzing a wide range of information related to photogrammetric map compilation and electronic data processing.
- An LLM could assist in quickly retrieving information on surveying and mapping methods, definitions, historical developments, and best practices from a vast amount of text data.
- The LLM could also help in summarizing complex documents related to surveying and mapping, providing insights, and generating reports based on the gathered information.
- While the LLM may not directly reduce the time it takes to conduct the research by half, the development of specialized software on top of the LLM could enhance its capabilities to provide more specific and tailored information for surveying tasks.

Based on these considerations, the task of conducting research in surveying and mapping methods could be classified as E2 - Exposure by LLM-powered applications.
