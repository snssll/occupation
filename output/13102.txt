1: In this task, the Meeting, Convention, and Event Planner is responsible for promoting conference, convention, and trade show services by meeting with professional and trade associations, as well as producing brochures and other publications. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves writing promotional materials such as brochures and publications, which could potentially benefit from the LLM's text generation capabilities to create compelling content efficiently.
- The LLM could assist in generating ideas for promotional strategies or refining the language used in the materials.
- While the LLM could be helpful in generating text content, it may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task, as the task also involves other aspects such as meeting with associations, which require human interaction and decision-making.

Considering these points, the task could be classified as E1 since the LLM can assist in generating written content for promotional materials, but the overall task still involves human interaction and decision-making that cannot be fully automated.
