1: In this task, a Manufactured Building and Mobile Home Installer is required to install, repair, and replace various items and systems in mobile and modular homes using hand tools or power tools. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be significantly aided by the use of the language model. Since the task involves physical work with hand tools and power tools, it does not directly involve text-based activities that the LLM can assist with. The LLM cannot physically install, repair, or replace items in buildings, so it cannot directly reduce the time it takes to complete this task.
