1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of developing or implementing marketing strategies for Spa Managers, we need to consider the level of exposure to LLM.

- E0: This task involves developing marketing strategies, which typically requires a high degree of human creativity, understanding of market trends, and customer preferences. LLM may not significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced Spa Manager to complete this task, as it involves strategic decision-making and creativity that may not be easily automated.

- E1: While LLM can assist in generating ideas for marketing strategies, providing insights on market trends, or drafting marketing materials, the core task of developing or implementing marketing strategies may still heavily rely on human expertise and judgment. LLM can help with parts of the task, but the overall process may not be significantly expedited by LLM alone.

- E2: With additional software developed on top of LLM, it is conceivable that tools could be created to analyze market data, consumer behavior, and competitor strategies to provide more targeted recommendations for marketing strategies. Such tools could potentially enhance the efficiency of developing and implementing marketing strategies for Spa Managers.

- E3: The task of developing or implementing marketing strategies may not benefit significantly from image capabilities. Since this task is primarily text-based and strategic in nature, image capabilities would not play a crucial role in expediting the completion of the task.
