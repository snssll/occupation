1: In this task of cleaning school bus interiors, the main actions involved are picking up waste, wiping down windows, and vacuuming. These actions do not require complex decision-making or specialized knowledge beyond general cleaning procedures. The task can be easily described and understood by the LLM, which can provide guidance on the steps to follow for effective cleaning. The LLM can generate detailed instructions on how to clean different surfaces, what cleaning products to use, and how to ensure a thorough cleaning process. However, the LLM does not have physical capabilities to perform the cleaning itself, so the task would still need to be carried out manually by a human. Therefore, the exposure to LLM for this task would fall under E2, as additional software could potentially be developed to provide step-by-step cleaning instructions based on the LLM's capabilities.
