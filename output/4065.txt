1: In this task, a glazier is required to cut and remove broken glass before installing replacement glass. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone or with additional software could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality.

- The task of cutting and removing broken glass is physical and hands-on, requiring specific skills and tools that cannot be replicated by the LLM.
- The task involves potential safety hazards and precise measurements, which are not within the capabilities of the LLM.
- While the LLM could potentially provide information on glass cutting techniques or safety guidelines, it cannot physically perform the task itself.
- There are no text-based or knowledge-based aspects of this task that the LLM could directly assist with.

Based on these considerations, it is clear that the task of cutting and removing broken glass is not suitable for exposure to the LLM, as it falls under the category of tasks that require physical, hands-on work and precise measurements.
