1: In this task, the Structural Iron and Steel Worker is responsible for aligning structural steel members in preparation for permanent attachment. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality. Since this task involves physical work, precise measurements, and hands-on skills, it is unlikely that the LLM can directly assist in completing it. The LLM does not have the capability to perform physical tasks or provide real-time guidance for aligning steel members accurately. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not meet the criteria for exposure to LLM capabilities.

2: E0

3: High
