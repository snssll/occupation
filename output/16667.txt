1: In this task, the occupation of midwives involves suturing perineal lacerations, which is a hands-on medical procedure requiring physical dexterity, knowledge of anatomy, and medical expertise. This task cannot be completed solely through text input and output, as it involves direct physical interaction with patients. The task also requires real-time decision-making based on the specific condition of the patient, which cannot be accurately captured by a language model.
