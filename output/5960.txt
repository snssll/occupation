1: In this task, the Continuous Mining Machine Operators are required to drive machines into position at working faces. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality. 

- E0: This task involves physical movement and operation of heavy machinery, which cannot be performed by the LLM or any software tool. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not involve text-based work that can be assisted by the LLM.

2: E0

3: High
