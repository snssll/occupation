1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of conducting research to gather information about survey topics as a Survey Researcher, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be aided by the use of the OpenAI large language model (LLM).

- E1: Direct exposure - The task involves researching and gathering information about survey topics, which can be significantly expedited by using the LLM to access a wide range of sources, analyze data, and generate insights based on the input provided. The LLM can assist in summarizing existing research, generating questions for surveys, and providing insights based on the gathered information.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone can enhance the efficiency of conducting research by providing access to a vast amount of information and assisting in data analysis, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to further streamline the process. This software could include tools for summarizing lengthy documents, retrieving up-to-date facts, and making recommendations based on the gathered information.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not directly relevant to the task of conducting research to gather information about survey topics. This task primarily involves text-based research and analysis, which can be effectively supported by the LLM without the need for image capabilities.

Based on the above analysis, the task of conducting research to gather information about survey topics aligns most closely with **E1: Direct exposure** as the LLM can significantly expedite the research process and enhance the quality of insights generated.
