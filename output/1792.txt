1: In this task, a Surveying and Mapping Technician is required to check all layers of maps for accuracy, identify errors, mark them, and make corrections. This task involves a significant amount of visual analysis and interpretation of spatial data. While the LLM can assist with providing information on mapping techniques, definitions, and general knowledge related to surveying and mapping, it cannot directly interact with maps or visually identify errors on them. The task also requires precise measurements and detailed visual inspection, which are not capabilities of the LLM. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as the LLM alone cannot significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete the task with high quality.
