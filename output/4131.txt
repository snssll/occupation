1: In this task, a Rock Splitter in a quarry is responsible for cutting slabs of stone into sheets for various construction purposes. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be impacted by the use of the LLM. 

- The task involves physical labor and precise cutting of stone, which cannot be directly assisted by the LLM.
- The task does not involve complex decision-making, analysis of data, or specialized knowledge that would significantly benefit from LLM capabilities.
- While the LLM could potentially provide information on stone cutting techniques or safety guidelines, the task itself is primarily manual labor that does not align with the capabilities of the LLM.

Based on these considerations, the task of cutting slabs of stone into sheets for floors or counters would be classified as E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM to significantly reduce the time or improve the quality of completion.

2: E0

3: High
