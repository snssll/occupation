1: In this task, a Sound Engineering Technician is responsible for setting up, testing, and adjusting recording equipment for recording sessions and live performances. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves technical knowledge and skills related to sound equipment, which may not directly benefit from the capabilities of a large language model (LLM). While the LLM could potentially provide some general information on sound engineering techniques, it is unlikely to significantly reduce the time it takes to physically set up and adjust recording equipment. Therefore, the task does not fall under E1, as it does not involve writing, transforming text, or providing edits that could be expedited by the LLM. Additionally, developing software on top of the LLM to directly assist in setting up recording equipment would be challenging and may not significantly reduce the time required for the task, so it does not fit under E2. Since the task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images, it also does not align with E3. Therefore, the most appropriate label for this task is E0.

2: E0

3: High
