1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of cleaning, restoring, and preserving artifacts as an Anthropologist or Archeologist, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be aided by the use of a large language model (LLM).

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** If the task involves documenting the artifacts, writing reports on the restoration process, or seeking information on specific preservation techniques, the LLM could significantly reduce the time needed to complete these written tasks. The LLM could assist in summarizing relevant information, providing guidelines on preservation methods, or even generating reports based on the restoration process.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the LLM alone may not directly reduce the time it takes to physically clean and restore artifacts, additional software built on top of the LLM could potentially aid in tasks such as summarizing complex restoration techniques, retrieving specialized knowledge on artifact preservation, or providing recommendations based on historical data related to similar artifacts.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Since the task involves physical artifacts, having image capabilities in addition to the LLM could be beneficial. This could include scanning images of artifacts for documentation, creating digital representations of the artifacts for preservation records, or editing digital images to visualize the restoration process.
