1: For the task of coordinating educational and public outreach programs as an archivist, the exposure to LLM can be evaluated as follows:

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** The task involves writing and organizing information related to educational and public outreach programs. The LLM can assist in drafting promotional materials, creating schedules, and generating content for workshops or lectures. It can also help in summarizing feedback from previous programs to improve future ones. Overall, the LLM can significantly reduce the time needed to plan and organize these programs efficiently.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the LLM can aid in generating content and organizing information, additional software could be developed to automate the scheduling process, analyze feedback data to make program recommendations, or even provide insights into trending topics for workshops or lectures. Such software could further streamline the coordination of educational and public outreach programs.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Image capabilities would not significantly impact the coordination of educational and public outreach programs in this context. The task primarily involves text-based activities such as planning, organizing, and promoting events, which can be effectively handled by the LLM without the need for image capabilities.

Based on the above analysis, the task of coordinating educational and public outreach programs as an archivist is best classified as **E1 (Direct exposure)**.
