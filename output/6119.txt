1: For the task of engraving or stamping identifying symbols on products, the exposure to LLM can be evaluated as follows:

- E1: Direct access to the LLM could potentially reduce the time it takes to complete this task by providing templates or examples of identifying symbols, letters, or numbers to engrave or stamp. The LLM could also assist in generating new ideas for symbols based on specific requirements.
- E2: While having access to the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time to complete the task, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to create a database of commonly used symbols, letters, or numbers for quick reference. This software could also provide suggestions for unique designs based on input criteria.
- E3: Image capabilities would not significantly impact the task of engraving or stamping identifying symbols on products, as it primarily involves text-based work rather than detailed image processing.

Based on the above analysis, the task of engraving or stamping identifying symbols on products could be best classified as E2.
