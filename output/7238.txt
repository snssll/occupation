1: In this task, a Correctional Officer or Jailer guards facility entrances to screen visitors. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. Guarding facility entrances and screening visitors involve primarily physical actions and interactions, such as observing individuals, checking identification, and ensuring security protocols are followed. These actions require real-time decision-making, physical presence, and the ability to respond to unpredictable situations. While an LLM could potentially provide information on security protocols or guidelines for visitor screening, the core aspect of physically guarding entrances and interacting with visitors cannot be effectively automated by the LLM. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not significantly benefit from LLM capabilities.
