1: In this task, the occupation involves applying coatings to workpiece surfaces using tools like spray guns, pens, or brushes. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if the task can be significantly expedited or improved by using the LLM. The task itself is hands-on and requires physical interaction with workpieces, tools, and surfaces. While the LLM could potentially provide information on different types of coatings, techniques, or safety measures, the core task of physically applying the coatings cannot be directly assisted by the LLM. Therefore, the task does not align with the capabilities of the LLM in a way that would significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task.
