1: In this task, a Nuclear Technician is required to adjust controls of equipment to control particle beam movement, pulse rates, energy or intensity, or radiation according to specifications. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- Adjusting controls of equipment based on specifications involves technical knowledge and expertise in nuclear technology.
- While the task involves specific instructions (specifications), it also requires hands-on manipulation of equipment and real-time monitoring of particle beam movement and radiation levels.
- The task does not involve writing, summarizing, translating, or analyzing text, which are typical tasks where an LLM could significantly reduce time.
- The task is highly specialized and requires practical skills that an LLM, even with additional software, may not be able to replicate effectively.

Based on these considerations, the task of adjusting controls of equipment as a Nuclear Technician is best classified as E0 - No exposure to LLM.

2: E0

3: High certainty
