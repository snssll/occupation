1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of presenting data, maps, or other information at construction-related public hearings or meetings as a Transportation Engineer, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves preparing and delivering information in a clear and concise manner to stakeholders. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM can assist in drafting and refining the content of the presentation, ensuring that the information is well-structured and effectively communicated. It can help in summarizing key points, generating visual aids, and crafting persuasive arguments to support the data presented.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time it takes to prepare for the public hearings or meetings, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to streamline the process. This software could automate the creation of visual aids, provide real-time data analysis for decision-making, or offer suggestions for engaging with different audience types.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities would not have a significant impact on this task as it primarily involves presenting data and maps verbally or through slides. The LLM's text capabilities are more relevant for crafting the content of the presentation.

Based on the above analysis, the task of presenting data, maps, or other information at construction-related public hearings or meetings as a Transportation Engineer would likely fall under **E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications**.
