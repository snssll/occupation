1: In this task, the detective or criminal investigator is required to participate or assist in raids and arrests. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. Participating or assisting in raids and arrests involves real-world actions, physical coordination, and legal implications. This task requires hands-on involvement, decision-making in real-time, and adherence to legal protocols. While an LLM could potentially provide information or guidance related to investigative procedures or legal aspects, it cannot physically participate in raids or arrests. Therefore, the task falls under E0 as it involves actions that cannot be performed by the LLM or any tool built on top of it.
