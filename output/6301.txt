1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of estimating costs or submitting bids for engineering projects as a Mechanical Engineer, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be impacted by the use of the LLM. 

- Mechanical Engineers typically rely on their expertise, project specifications, and industry knowledge to estimate costs accurately. This task involves analyzing various factors, such as materials, labor, equipment, and project scope, to provide an accurate bid.
- While the LLM can provide general information on cost estimation principles and industry trends, it may not have access to specific project details, up-to-date market prices, or real-time data required for accurate bidding.
- The LLM could potentially assist in generating written content for bid proposals or providing general advice on cost estimation methodologies, but the task of estimating costs for specific engineering projects may require specialized domain knowledge and real-time data that the LLM alone may not have access to.

Based on these considerations, the task of estimating costs or submitting bids for engineering projects as a Mechanical Engineer would likely fall under E2 - Exposure by LLM-powered applications. While the LLM could provide some general assistance and information, additional software or tools specifically tailored for cost estimation in engineering projects would be needed to significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with high quality.
