1: In this task, the commercial divers are required to take appropriate safety precautions before diving expeditions begin. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task. Since the task involves ensuring safety measures are in place, such as monitoring dive lengths and depths and registering with authorities, it does not directly involve text-based tasks that the LLM can assist with. The task also requires practical, hands-on actions that cannot be completed through text-based interactions with the LLM. Therefore, the task does not fall under E1, E2, or E3 categories.

2: E0

3: High
