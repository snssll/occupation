1: In this task, the occupation involves packers and packagers who are responsible for loading materials and products into package processing equipment. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if access to the LLM or LLM-powered tools can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete the task with high quality by at least half.

- E0: This task involves physical actions such as loading materials into equipment, which cannot be directly assisted by the LLM or LLM-powered tools. The task requires manual labor and does not involve text-based or analytical work that the LLM can assist with.

- E1: The task does not involve writing, transforming text, providing edits, summarizing documents, or any other text-based activities that the LLM can directly assist with. Therefore, direct access to the LLM would not reduce the time it takes to complete this task by at least half.

- E2: While it is conceivable that specialized software could be developed to optimize the packaging process or provide recommendations based on data, the core task of physically loading materials into package processing equipment is not one that can be significantly expedited by the LLM alone.

- E3: The task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images, so the image capabilities of the LLM are not relevant here.

2: E0

3: High
