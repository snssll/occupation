1: In this task, a general dentist applies fluoride or sealants to teeth. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. Applying fluoride or sealants to teeth involves manual dexterity and physical interaction with patients. This task does not involve complex text input or output that would benefit significantly from the capabilities of an LLM. The task also does not require accessing up-to-date information or specialized domain knowledge that an LLM could provide. Therefore, this task does not align with any of the exposure levels in the rubric.

2: E0

3: High
