1: In this task, a First-Line Supervisor of Police and Detectives is responsible for developing, implementing, and revising departmental policies and procedures. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we can break down the task as follows:

- Developing departmental policies and procedures: The LLM can assist in researching best practices, legal requirements, and industry standards to help in the development of policies and procedures.
- Implementing policies and procedures: The LLM can provide guidance on how to effectively communicate and train staff on new policies and procedures.
- Revising departmental policies and procedures: The LLM can help in analyzing feedback, identifying areas for improvement, and drafting revised policies and procedures.

Given that the task involves a significant amount of text-based work, research, and analysis, the LLM can be highly beneficial in reducing the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality.
