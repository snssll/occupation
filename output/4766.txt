1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of developing and maintaining websites for online courses as a Computer Science Teacher, Postsecondary, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The task involves writing and transforming text and code according to complex instructions, which the LLM can assist with by providing code snippets, suggestions, and explanations to help in website development. The LLM can also help in generating content for the websites based on the input provided.
- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not reduce the time significantly for this task, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to automate certain aspects of website development, such as generating templates, layouts, or interactive elements based on the course content.
- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not directly relevant to developing and maintaining websites for online courses, so this label does not apply.

Considering the above points, the task of developing and maintaining websites for online courses as a Computer Science Teacher, Postsecondary would likely fall under **E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications** as additional software could be developed to enhance the efficiency of website development.
