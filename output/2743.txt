1: In this task, the Welding, Soldering, and Brazing Machine Setters, Operators, and Tenders need to compute and record settings for new work based on their knowledge of metal properties, welding principles, and shop mathematics. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the LLM can assist in computing and recording these settings by providing information on metal properties, welding principles, and shop mathematics. The LLM can potentially provide information on these topics, such as explaining metal properties, principles of welding, and mathematical calculations involved in setting up welding machines. However, the task also requires practical application and hands-on skills that the LLM cannot directly assist with, such as physically setting up the machine and adjusting settings based on the specific work requirements. Therefore, while the LLM can provide theoretical knowledge and guidance, it cannot directly perform the hands-on tasks required for this occupation.
