1: In this task, an architect is required to represent clients in obtaining bids or awarding construction contracts. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. This task involves communication, negotiation, and decision-making based on client needs and project requirements. While an LLM could potentially assist in drafting communication materials or providing information on standard procedures, the task primarily involves human interaction, legal considerations, and complex decision-making that may require in-depth knowledge of construction processes and regulations. The LLM may not have the ability to fully understand the nuances of client needs, project specifications, or legal requirements involved in awarding construction contracts. Therefore, the task is best classified as E0, as it involves a high degree of human interaction, legal considerations, and specialized knowledge that may not be effectively handled by the LLM alone.
