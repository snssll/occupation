1: In this task, a glazier is required to select the type or color of glass or mirror according to specifications. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes for a glazier to complete this task with high quality. 

- E0: This task involves a physical aspect of selecting glass or mirror, which cannot be done through text input/output alone. The task requires the glazier to physically assess the glass or mirror based on specifications, which cannot be achieved through the LLM.
- E1: While the LLM could potentially provide information on different types of glass or mirror based on text input, the final selection process would still require physical inspection by the glazier. The LLM cannot directly assist in the physical selection process.
- E2: It is conceivable that a specialized software tool could be developed on top of the LLM that could help glaziers by providing recommendations based on specifications and requirements. This tool could potentially streamline the decision-making process for selecting the type or color of glass or mirror.
- E3: The task does not involve image capabilities that would significantly impact the time it takes to complete the task.

Based on the above analysis, the most appropriate label for this task is E2.

2: E2

3: Moderate
