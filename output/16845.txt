1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of teaching writing classes as a Poet, Lyricist, or Creative Writer, we need to consider how the task can be completed with the help of an LLM. Teaching writing classes involves providing instruction, feedback, and guidance to students on various aspects of writing, such as structure, style, and creativity. An LLM could assist in preparing lesson materials, generating writing prompts, providing feedback on student work, and even answering questions related to writing techniques or concepts. The LLM could also help in creating examples, exercises, and resources for the class.

Given that the task involves a significant amount of human interaction, creativity, and personalized instruction, it may not be easily automated or completed solely by an LLM. While the LLM can assist in certain aspects of teaching writing classes, such as providing resources or feedback, the core of teaching—building relationships with students, understanding their individual needs, and fostering creativity—requires human expertise and interaction. Therefore, the task of teaching writing classes as a Poet, Lyricist, or Creative Writer would likely fall under E0, as the use of an LLM would not significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced teacher to complete the task with high quality.
