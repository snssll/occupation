1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of assisting users in formulating Geographic Information Systems (GIS) requirements or understanding the implications of alternatives, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be impacted by the use of a large language model (LLM).

- This task involves providing assistance to users in a specialized field like Geographic Information Systems (GIS), which may require domain-specific knowledge and expertise.
- The task involves understanding user requirements and explaining the implications of different alternatives, which may involve complex technical concepts and data analysis.
- An LLM could potentially assist in providing explanations, generating examples, or summarizing information related to GIS requirements and implications.
- While the LLM may not have direct access to specialized GIS knowledge, it can still help in formulating responses, providing explanations, and generating relevant content based on the input provided.

Based on these considerations, the task of assisting users in formulating GIS requirements or understanding implications could be classified as E2 - Exposure by LLM-powered applications. While the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time to complete the task, additional software built on top of the LLM could enhance the efficiency of providing explanations and generating content related to GIS requirements.
