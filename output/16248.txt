1: In this task, the occupation involves sailors and marine oilers who steer ships under the direction of commanders or navigating officers. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone or with additional software could significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete the task with high quality by at least half.

- E0: This task involves physically steering ships, which cannot be automated or completed by the LLM or any software tools. It requires human interaction and physical presence, making it unsuitable for automation.

- E1: The task of steering ships involves real-time decision-making, navigation, and response to changing conditions at sea. While the LLM could potentially provide information on navigation techniques or maritime regulations, it cannot physically steer a ship or replace the skills and experience of a sailor. Therefore, the task cannot be completed solely by the LLM or with a significant reduction in time.

- E2: While the LLM could potentially assist with providing information on maritime regulations, navigation techniques, or historical data related to ship steering, it cannot directly steer a ship or replace the expertise of sailors and marine oilers. Developing additional software on top of the LLM to analyze real-time data from ship instruments and provide recommendations could potentially aid in decision-making but would not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task.

- E3: The task of steering ships does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images. Therefore, the image capabilities of the LLM would not significantly impact the completion of this task.

Based on the above analysis, the most appropriate label for this task is E0.

2: E0

3: High
