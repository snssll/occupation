1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of computing taxes owed or overpaid as a Tax Preparer, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves using adding machines or personal computers to compute taxes and complete entries on forms following tax form instructions and tax tables. The LLM can assist in providing information on tax form instructions and tax tables, as well as help with calculations. It can generate sample calculations, provide explanations for tax rules, and offer guidance on completing tax forms accurately. This task does not require specialized domain knowledge beyond tax regulations, which the LLM can handle effectively. Therefore, the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality, making it fall under label E1.
