1: For the task of selecting and obtaining materials and supplies for Art, Drama, and Music Teachers, Postsecondary, the exposure to LLM can be evaluated as follows:

- E0: This task involves physical actions such as selecting and obtaining materials and supplies, which cannot be directly performed by the LLM or any systems built on top of it. The task also does not involve complex decision-making that could be automated by the LLM.

- E1: While the LLM could potentially assist in generating lists of recommended textbooks or performance pieces based on input criteria, the actual selection and obtaining of materials and supplies would still require physical actions that the LLM cannot perform.

- E2: It is conceivable that a specialized software application could be developed on top of the LLM to streamline the process of recommending materials and supplies based on specific criteria provided by the teachers. This application could potentially save time by quickly generating tailored lists of resources for the teachers to consider.

- E3: The task does not involve image capabilities or detailed visual analysis, so exposure to LLM with image capabilities would not significantly impact the completion of this task.
