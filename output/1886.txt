1: In this task, a waiter or waitress is responsible for checking with customers to ensure they are enjoying their meals and taking action to correct any problems. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be significantly expedited or improved by using the language model. Since this task involves direct interaction with customers in a restaurant setting, it requires human judgment, empathy, and real-time communication skills.
