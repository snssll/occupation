1: In this task of washing and resetting wigs, a Makeup Artist, Theatrical and Performance would typically need to follow specific instructions on how to clean and style wigs to ensure they are ready for use in performances. The task involves a hands-on approach that requires physical manipulation of the wigs, such as washing, conditioning, and styling them. Since this task involves manual dexterity and practical skills, it does not seem feasible for an LLM to directly assist in completing the task. The LLM lacks the ability to physically interact with objects or perform tasks that require physical touch. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not benefit from exposure to the LLM.
