1: In this task, the teaching assistant is responsible for assisting in bus loading and unloading. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone or with additional software could significantly reduce the time it takes for a teaching assistant to complete this task. Since this task involves physical interaction and supervision of students during bus loading and unloading, it does not seem feasible for the LLM or any software built on top of it to assist in this process. The task requires real-time monitoring, ensuring student safety, and physical presence, which are not capabilities of the LLM. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM or any software that could be developed on top of it.
