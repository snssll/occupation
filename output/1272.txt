1: In this task, the occupation involves Licensed Practical and Licensed Vocational Nurses assisting in the delivery, care, or feeding of infants. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality. 

Assisting in the delivery, care, or feeding of infants is a hands-on task that requires physical interaction and specialized skills in healthcare. The task involves direct care for infants, which includes tasks like monitoring vital signs, administering medications, and providing emotional support to both the infant and their families. This task is highly specialized and requires practical, hands-on experience and training.
