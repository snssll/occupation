1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of writing grant applications, rebate applications, or project proposals to secure funding for sustainability projects as a Sustainability Specialist, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could assist in completing it.

- Writing grant applications, rebate applications, or project proposals involves a significant amount of text generation and transformation based on specific guidelines and requirements. The LLM can be used to draft, edit, and refine these documents, potentially saving time and ensuring high-quality output.
- The LLM can provide suggestions, generate content, and help structure the applications or proposals effectively, based on the input provided about the sustainability projects.
- While the LLM alone may not reduce the time to complete the task by half, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to streamline the process further. For example, an application that can analyze funding requirements, match them with project details, and generate tailored proposals could significantly expedite the process.

Based on these considerations, the task of writing grant applications, rebate applications, or project proposals to secure funding for sustainability projects could be classified as E2 - Exposure by LLM-powered applications.
