1: In this task, a Surveying and Mapping Technician is required to produce or update overlay maps showing information boundaries, water locations, or topographic features on different base maps or at varying scales. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The LLM can assist in tasks that involve text input and output, but it does not have the ability to process visual information like maps. While the LLM could potentially help with generating text descriptions of maps or providing information related to surveying and mapping techniques, it cannot directly manipulate or create visual maps. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it involves detailed visual work that the LLM is not equipped to handle.
