1: In this task, a Parking Enforcement Worker is required to remove handbills within patrol areas. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. Removing handbills involves physical interaction with the environment, such as walking around, reaching for handbills, and physically removing them. This task does not involve complex text input or output that can be easily handled by an LLM. Additionally, the task does not require any specialized knowledge or data retrieval that would benefit significantly from LLM capabilities. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM or any tools built on top of it.

2: E0

3: Certainty level: High
