1: In this task, the occupation involves monitoring patrons' facility use to ensure rules and regulations are followed, safety is maintained, and order is kept. This task primarily involves observing and enforcing guidelines within a physical space. The task does not involve complex text processing, data analysis, or decision-making that could be significantly enhanced by the use of an LLM. The task is more focused on physical presence and interaction with patrons. Therefore, the use of an LLM or LLM-powered tool would not reduce the time it takes to complete this task significantly. As such, this task falls under E0 as it does not benefit from LLM exposure.

2: E0

3: High
