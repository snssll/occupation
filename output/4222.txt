1: In this task, a Maid or Housekeeping Cleaner is responsible for delivering various items to guests' rooms. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality. 

- The task involves physical movement and interaction with guests, which cannot be replaced by text-based interactions with the LLM.
- The task does not involve complex text-based instructions, writing, summarizing documents, or any other text-heavy activities that the LLM could directly assist with.
- The task does not require specialized domain knowledge or data retrieval that could be enhanced by additional software built on top of the LLM.
- The task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images, so image capabilities would not be relevant.

Based on these considerations, the task of delivering items to guests' rooms as a Maid or Housekeeping Cleaner would be classified as E0 as it does not align with any of the exposure levels described in the rubric.

2: E0

3: High
