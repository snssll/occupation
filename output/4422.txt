1: In this task, a Business Continuity Planner is responsible for designing or implementing products and services to mitigate risk or facilitate the use of technology-based tools and methods. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- Writing and transforming text: The task involves designing and implementing products and services, which may require detailed planning and documentation. The LLM can assist in generating text for proposals, reports, or documentation related to the products and services being developed.

- Providing feedback on documents: The LLM can help in providing feedback on written documents related to risk mitigation strategies or technology implementation plans.

- Prepare training materials based on general knowledge: The LLM can aid in preparing training materials for staff on how to use technology-based tools effectively or how to follow risk mitigation protocols.

Considering these points, the task can benefit significantly from the LLM's capabilities in generating text, providing feedback, and preparing training materials. Therefore, the task falls under label E1 - Direct exposure.
