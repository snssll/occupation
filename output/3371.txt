1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of configuring servers to meet functional specifications for Computer Systems Engineers/Architects, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. In this task, the LLM could potentially assist in providing guidance on server configurations based on functional specifications. The LLM could generate text-based recommendations, suggest best practices, or even provide sample configurations. However, the task of actually physically configuring the servers would still require human intervention as the LLM cannot interact with physical hardware. Therefore, while the LLM can provide valuable insights and recommendations, it cannot directly perform the task of configuring servers.

Based on this analysis, the task falls under E2 - Exposure by LLM-powered applications. While the LLM alone may not reduce the time it takes to complete the task by at least half, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to streamline the process by providing detailed server configuration recommendations and best practices.
