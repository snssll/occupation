1: In this task, a Set and Exhibit Designer is required to prepare rough drafts and scale working drawings of sets, including floor plans, scenery, and properties to be constructed. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves creating visual representations of sets and exhibits, which may not directly benefit from the text-based capabilities of the LLM. While the LLM could potentially assist in generating written descriptions or explanations related to the designs, the core aspect of this task involves visual design and drafting, which may not be significantly impacted by text-based language models. Therefore, the task does not align well with the capabilities of the LLM in its current form.
