1: In this task, a Bus and Truck Mechanic or Diesel Engine Specialist is required to test drive trucks and buses to diagnose malfunctions or ensure they are working correctly. This task involves physically driving the vehicles, observing their performance, and identifying any issues that may arise during the test drive. Since this task involves hands-on work and physical interaction with the vehicles, it cannot be directly completed using the LLM or any software tools built on top of it. The LLM does not have the capability to physically test drive vehicles or diagnose mechanical issues based on physical observations.
