1: In this task, a Drywall and Ceiling Tile Installer is required to scribe and cut edges of tiles to fit walls where wall molding is not specified. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves a physical aspect of scribing and cutting tiles, which cannot be directly performed by an LLM. While the LLM could potentially provide guidance on techniques or best practices for scribing and cutting tiles, it cannot physically execute these actions. Therefore, the task does not fall under E1, E2, or E3 as it involves physical work that cannot be directly assisted by the LLM.

2: E0
