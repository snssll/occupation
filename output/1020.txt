1: In this task, a Transportation Security Screener asks passengers to remove shoes and metal objects before going through metal detectors. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. This task involves interacting with passengers, providing instructions, and ensuring compliance with security procedures. While the LLM could potentially assist in generating scripts or guidelines for communication, it cannot physically interact with passengers or enforce compliance. Therefore, the task does not involve text-based activities that the LLM could significantly impact. As a result, this task falls under E0 as it does not meet the criteria for exposure to LLM capabilities.

2: E0

3: High
