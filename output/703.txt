1: In this task, a Stocker and Order Filler is required to answer customers' questions about merchandise and advise them on merchandise selection. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves providing information and recommendations based on existing knowledge about merchandise, which can be within the capabilities of the LLM.
- The LLM can assist in generating responses to common customer queries and providing guidance on merchandise selection based on general knowledge.
- The task does not involve highly specialized domain knowledge or complex databases that would require additional software beyond the LLM.
- While the LLM can help with generating responses, it may not significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete the task, as human interaction and real-time customer engagement are crucial aspects of this role.

Based on these considerations, the task falls under E2 - Exposure by LLM-powered applications.

2: E2

3: Moderate
