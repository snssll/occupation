1: In this task, a Diagnostic Medical Sonographer is responsible for providing sonograms and summarizing technical findings for physicians to aid in medical diagnosis. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we can break down the task:
- The task involves generating a written summary of technical findings based on the sonogram results. This can be done efficiently by an LLM, as it requires transforming technical information into a coherent written format.
- The task does not involve any visual analysis beyond interpreting the sonogram results, so there is no need for image capabilities.
- While the task involves medical terminology and technical details, the LLM can assist in summarizing and presenting this information effectively.

Based on these considerations, the task falls under E1 as the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality by transforming technical findings into a written summary.
