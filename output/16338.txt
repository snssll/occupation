1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of studying basic principles of plant and animal life as a biologist, we need to consider how the task can be completed with the help of an LLM. In this case, the task involves studying fundamental concepts related to biology, such as origin, relationship, development, anatomy, and function of plants and animals. An LLM can provide information on these topics by generating text, summarizing relevant documents, answering questions, and providing explanations based on existing knowledge. The LLM can assist in researching and understanding these basic principles by providing detailed information, definitions, examples, and explanations related to plant and animal life.

Given that the task involves accessing and understanding information related to biology, an LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to gather and comprehend this information. The LLM can provide quick access to a wide range of resources and knowledge related to biology, allowing the biologist to study and learn more efficiently.
