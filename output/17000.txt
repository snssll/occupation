1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of testing tags or labels to ensure readability for Radio Frequency Identification Device Specialists, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be impacted by the use of the LLM. 

- E1: Direct exposure - If the task involves writing reports on the test results, generating test plans, or providing feedback on the readability of tags based on specific criteria, the LLM could significantly reduce the time needed to complete these tasks by assisting in drafting reports, analyzing data, or generating test plans.
  
- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not directly reduce the time to test tags physically, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to streamline the process. For example, an application that can analyze test data, provide recommendations for improving readability, or generate automated test scripts could enhance the efficiency of the testing process.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Since the task involves testing tags or labels for readability, image capabilities may not have a significant impact on completing this task. The task is more focused on physical testing rather than image analysis or creation.
