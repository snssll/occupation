1: In this task, a Surveying and Mapping Technician is required to identify and compile database information to create requested maps. With the help of a large language model (LLM), the technician can potentially streamline the process of gathering and organizing data from various sources to create maps. The LLM can assist in extracting relevant information, summarizing data, and even generating initial drafts of maps based on the compiled database information. This would significantly reduce the time and effort required by the technician to manually sift through data and organize it for map creation.

Considering the capabilities of the LLM to process text input, extract key information, and assist in data organization, this task falls under E1 - Direct exposure. The LLM can efficiently handle text-based tasks, such as compiling database information and providing assistance in map creation, thereby reducing the time needed for the technician to complete the task.
