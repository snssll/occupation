1: In this task, the Earth Driller is required to drill or bore holes in rock for various purposes. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves physical work that cannot be automated by an LLM or any software tool. It requires specialized equipment, physical strength, and expertise in drilling techniques. The task does not involve text input or output, and the context cannot be captured within 2000 words. Therefore, the task does not align with any of the exposure levels in the rubric.
