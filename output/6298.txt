1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of estimating costs of repairs based on parts and labor requirements for Electrical and Electronics Installers and Repairers, Transportation Equipment, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be aided by the use of a large language model (LLM).

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** If the task involves writing and transforming text to calculate costs, providing edits to cost estimates, or generating detailed breakdowns of repair costs based on input data, the LLM could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality. The LLM could assist in performing calculations, generating detailed reports, and providing accurate estimates based on the input data.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the LLM alone may not reduce the time it takes to estimate costs by half, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to streamline the process. This software could potentially automate the calculation of repair costs, retrieve up-to-date pricing information for parts, and provide recommendations for cost-effective repair solutions.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Image capabilities are not directly relevant to estimating costs based on parts and labor requirements. This task primarily involves textual data related to repair costs and does not require image processing capabilities.

Considering the task of estimating costs of repairs based on parts and labor requirements, the most suitable label appears to be **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications)**. While the LLM alone may not halve the time it takes to complete the task, the development of additional software leveraging the LLM's capabilities could significantly streamline the process.
