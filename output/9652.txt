1: In this task, the Energy Auditors are required to measure energy usage using various devices such as data loggers, light meters, thermometers, etc. The task involves physical measurements and the use of specialized equipment. The LLM, even though powerful in text-based tasks, does not have the capability to physically interact with devices or take measurements. While the LLM could potentially provide information on how to use these devices or interpret the data collected, it cannot directly perform the measurements itself. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not involve text-based interactions that the LLM can assist with.

2: E0

3: High
