1: In this task, a Materials Engineer is required to analyze product failure data and laboratory test results to determine the causes of problems and develop solutions. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves analyzing data, which can be text-based (product failure reports, test results) and requires synthesizing information to identify patterns and root causes.
- The task involves problem-solving and developing solutions based on the analysis of the data.
- While the task may involve technical knowledge specific to materials engineering, the core components involve data analysis, problem-solving, and solution development, which are areas where an LLM can provide significant assistance by processing and interpreting the information provided.

Given that the task involves analyzing data and developing solutions based on that analysis, an LLM can assist in processing and interpreting the information, potentially reducing the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality. Therefore, this task falls under label E1.
