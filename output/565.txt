1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of analyzing information about supplier performance or procurement program success as a Supply Chain Manager, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be supported by the capabilities of the LLM.

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** The task involves analyzing information, which can benefit from the LLM's ability to process and interpret text data. The LLM can assist in summarizing reports, providing insights based on the data, and generating recommendations. Since the task primarily involves working with text-based information and making decisions based on that data, direct access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the analysis with equivalent quality.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the LLM can assist in analyzing text data, the task may also require accessing up-to-date information about supplier performance or procurement trends, which may not be within the LLM's capabilities without specific development. Additional software that integrates the LLM with real-time data sources or specialized databases could enhance the efficiency of analyzing supplier performance. Therefore, there is potential for LLM-powered applications to further streamline the analysis process.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Image capabilities are not directly relevant to the task of analyzing information about supplier performance or procurement program success. The task primarily involves working with text-based reports, data, and metrics, which can be effectively handled by the LLM without the need for image processing capabilities.
