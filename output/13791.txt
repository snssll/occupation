1: In this task, an upholsterer needs to read work orders and apply their knowledge and experience with materials to determine the types and amounts of materials required to cover workpieces. To complete this task, the upholsterer needs to understand the specific requirements of each work order, assess the materials needed based on the workpiece, and make decisions on the types and quantities of materials to use. An LLM could potentially assist by providing information on different types of materials, their properties, and possibly even recommendations based on the work order details. The LLM could also help in generating suggestions for material choices based on the workpiece description. However, since this task involves practical knowledge and experience with materials that may not be easily captured in text form, the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with high quality.
