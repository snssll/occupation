1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of preparing and delivering lectures as a Sociology Teacher, Postsecondary, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM could assist in writing and transforming lecture content based on complex instructions, providing edits to existing lecture materials, generating questions for assessments, and potentially even summarizing relevant documents for lecture preparation. The LLM could also help in responding to student queries or feedback on lecture materials. Overall, the LLM could significantly reduce the time needed to prepare lectures with equivalent quality.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not reduce the time to complete the task by half, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to summarize longer documents, retrieve up-to-date facts for lectures, provide recommendations based on data, and analyze information to inform lecture content. This additional software could enhance the efficiency of lecture preparation and delivery.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities would not significantly impact the task of preparing and delivering lectures in sociology, as the primary focus is on text-based content and interactions with students. Therefore, image capabilities are not relevant for this task.
