1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of instructing students individually and in groups as a Kindergarten Teacher, we need to consider how the task can be completed with the help of an LLM. 

- Kindergarten Teachers often need to adapt their teaching methods to meet the varying needs and interests of students. An LLM could assist in providing personalized teaching strategies based on individual student profiles and learning styles. The LLM could generate tailored lesson plans, activities, and resources to cater to different students' needs.

- The LLM could also help in creating engaging and interactive learning materials, such as stories, games, or exercises, that align with students' interests. Additionally, it could provide suggestions for effective classroom management techniques to support both individual and group instruction.

- While the LLM can generate text-based content and recommendations, it cannot physically interact with students or provide real-time feedback on student progress. Human interaction, observation, and assessment are crucial aspects of teaching in a kindergarten setting that cannot be fully replaced by an LLM.
