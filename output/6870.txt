1: In this task, a sheet metal worker is required to fabricate or alter parts at construction sites using various tools like shears, hammers, punches, or drills. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes for a sheet metal worker to complete this task with high quality.

- The task involves physical work that cannot be directly replaced by text-based instructions or responses from the LLM.
- The task requires hands-on skills and expertise in working with metal, which cannot be replicated by the LLM.
- The LLM does not have the capability to perform physical tasks like fabricating or altering metal parts using tools.
- The task does not involve writing, summarizing documents, providing feedback on written content, or any other text-based activities that the LLM can assist with.

Based on these considerations, it is clear that the task of fabricating or altering parts at construction sites as a sheet metal worker falls under the E0 category as it cannot be significantly aided by the LLM.

2: E0

3: High
