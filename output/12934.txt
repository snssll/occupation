1: For the task of presenting and summarizing cases to judges and juries as a lawyer, the exposure to LLM can be evaluated as follows:

- E1: Direct access to the LLM could significantly reduce the time it takes to prepare case summaries and presentations. The LLM can assist in drafting arguments, summarizing complex legal documents, and providing relevant legal precedents, which are crucial for presenting cases effectively to judges and juries.

- E2: While additional software could potentially be developed on top of the LLM to automate the process of summarizing cases and generating presentations, the task of presenting and summarizing cases involves a high level of legal expertise and human judgment that may not be easily replicated by software alone.

- E3: Image capabilities are not relevant for this task as it primarily involves text-based legal documents and verbal presentations rather than images.

Based on the above analysis, the task of presenting and summarizing cases to judges and juries as a lawyer is best classified as E2.
