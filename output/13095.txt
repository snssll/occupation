1: In this task, a Lighting Technician is responsible for programming lighting consoles or loading automated lighting control systems onto consoles. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- Programming lighting consoles involves technical knowledge and expertise in setting up and controlling lighting systems for events or performances. This task may involve writing specific commands, sequences, and configurations to achieve the desired lighting effects.
- While an LLM could potentially assist in providing general information about lighting systems or basic programming concepts, the task itself requires hands-on interaction with the lighting equipment and systems.
- The task does not involve text-based inputs or outputs that can be easily processed by an LLM. It requires practical skills and direct interaction with physical equipment.
- Additionally, the task involves working with hardware and software specific to lighting control, which may not be easily accessible or compatible with an LLM.

Based on these considerations, the task of programming lighting consoles or loading automated lighting control systems onto consoles is best classified as E0 - No exposure to LLM.
