1: In this task, an Electrical Power-Line Installer and Repairer is required to trim trees that pose a hazard to the functioning of cables or wires. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. Trimming trees involves physical work that cannot be directly performed by an LLM. The task requires on-site assessment, decision-making based on real-time conditions, and physical action. While an LLM could potentially provide information on tree trimming techniques or safety guidelines, it cannot physically trim trees. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it involves physical work that cannot be automated by an LLM.
