1: In this task, a Nurse Anesthetist is required to perform pre-anesthetic screenings, which involve physical evaluations, patient interviews, and documenting the results. With the help of the LLM, the nurse could potentially streamline the documentation process by generating standardized templates for recording the screening results. The LLM could assist in creating detailed and accurate documentation based on the information gathered during the screenings. Additionally, the LLM could provide guidance on common questions to ask during patient interviews, ensuring comprehensive information is collected. Overall, the LLM could significantly reduce the time required for documentation and potentially improve the quality of the recorded information.

Considering these factors, the task of performing pre-anesthetic screenings and documenting results could be categorized as E1. The LLM can assist in transforming text (documentation) based on complex instructions (screening results) and provide edits to existing text (templates for documentation). It can also help in maintaining records of written data (screening results) efficiently.
