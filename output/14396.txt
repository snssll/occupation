1: In this task, a Mail Clerk or Mail Machine Operator is responsible for removing printed materials from machines, such as labeled articles, postmarked envelopes, tape, and folded sheets. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. This task involves physical interaction with machines and printed materials, which cannot be directly handled by an LLM. The task does not involve complex decision-making, analysis, or specialized knowledge that would benefit significantly from LLM capabilities. As such, the task does not align with the capabilities of an LLM or any tools built on top of it. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not benefit from LLM exposure.

2: E0
