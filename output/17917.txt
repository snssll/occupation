1: For the task of writing online blog entries as a News Analyst, Reporter, or Journalist, the exposure to LLM can be evaluated as follows:

- Writing online blog entries involves transforming thoughts and information into written content. The LLM can assist in generating ideas, structuring content, and even providing additional information or opinions on news events.
- The LLM can help in summarizing news developments, providing background information, and generating commentary on events.
- While the LLM can assist in writing the blog entries, it may not significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced journalist to complete the task, as the task requires creativity, critical thinking, and a deep understanding of the news industry.
- The LLM alone may not be able to provide the nuanced insights, investigative reporting, or personal experiences that are often required in blog entries by journalists.

Based on these considerations, the task of writing online blog entries as a News Analyst, Reporter, or Journalist would likely fall under label E2 - Exposure by LLM-powered applications. While the LLM can assist in generating content and providing information, additional software tailored to the news industry and journalistic practices would be needed to significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task.
