1: In this task, a First-Line Supervisor of Non-Retail Sales Workers is required to formulate pricing policies on merchandise according to profitability requirements. To complete this task, the supervisor needs to consider various factors such as cost of goods, market demand, competition, and profit margins. The supervisor may need to analyze data, trends, and financial information to make informed decisions on pricing strategies.

Considering the task description, the exposure to LLM can be evaluated as follows:
- The LLM can assist in providing information on pricing strategies, market trends, and industry best practices based on the input provided.
- The LLM can help in generating different pricing policy options based on profitability requirements and other specified criteria.
- The LLM can aid in analyzing data and trends to support the decision-making process for formulating pricing policies.

Based on these considerations, the task falls under E2 - Exposure by LLM-powered applications. While the LLM alone may not reduce the time significantly to complete the task, additional software built on top of the LLM could enhance the process by providing recommendations, analyzing data, and offering insights to support pricing policy formulation.
