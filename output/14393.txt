1: In this task, a painter in construction and maintenance needs to remove fixtures like pictures, door knobs, lamps, or electric switch covers before painting. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. This task involves physical actions such as unscrewing fixtures and removing them, which cannot be directly performed by an LLM. The task does not involve complex decision-making, specialized knowledge retrieval, or detailed analysis that would benefit significantly from LLM capabilities. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM or any tools built on top of it.
