1: In this task, the occupation involves structural metal fabricators and fitters who are responsible for erecting ladders and scaffolding to fit together large assemblies. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone or with additional software could significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete the task with high quality by at least half.

Given that this task involves physical work such as erecting ladders and scaffolding, it falls under the category of tasks that require physical interaction and precise measurements, which are classified as E0. The LLM and systems built on top of it cannot perform physical tasks or make decisions that require human judgment in physical construction activities.

2: E0

3: High
