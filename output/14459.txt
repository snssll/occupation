1: In this task, a tailor or dressmaker is required to remove stitches from garments using tools like rippers or razor blades. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it. 

- E0: This task involves physical manipulation of garments and tools, which cannot be directly assisted by the LLM or any software tool. The task requires manual dexterity and precision, which cannot be replicated by the LLM.

- E1: While the LLM could potentially provide information on techniques for removing stitches or offer general advice on garment alteration, it cannot physically remove stitches from garments using rippers or razor blades. The task is hands-on and requires practical skills that the LLM cannot perform.

- E2: It is challenging to imagine additional software that could be developed on top of the LLM to significantly reduce the time it takes to physically remove stitches from garments. The task is specific to the physical alteration of clothing and does not involve complex data analysis or decision-making that could be automated.

- E3: The task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images. The use of image capabilities would not significantly aid in the physical task of removing stitches from garments.
