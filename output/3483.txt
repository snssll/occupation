1: In this task, a Cost Estimator is required to consult with various stakeholders to discuss estimates and resolve issues. To complete this task, the Cost Estimator needs to communicate effectively, understand the project requirements, and negotiate with different parties. The LLM can assist in providing sample communication templates, suggesting negotiation strategies, or offering potential solutions based on common industry practices. However, the task primarily involves human interaction, understanding complex project details, and making decisions based on various inputs, which are not solely text-based. While the LLM can provide some support in generating written communication, it cannot replace the need for direct interaction and decision-making in this task.
