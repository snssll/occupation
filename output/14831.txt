1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of resolving customer complaints regarding food service for First-Line Supervisors of Food Preparation and Serving Workers, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. In this task, the supervisor would need to communicate effectively with customers, understand their complaints, and provide appropriate solutions. The LLM can assist in generating responses to common customer complaints, providing guidance on handling difficult customers, and suggesting strategies for resolving issues. The LLM can also help in drafting written responses or scripts for verbal communication.

Given that the task involves written and spoken communication, which are areas where the LLM excels, it is likely that direct access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality. The LLM can provide templates, suggestions, and language that supervisors can use to address customer complaints effectively.
