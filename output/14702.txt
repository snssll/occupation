1: In this task, a Fast Food and Counter Worker is responsible for taking customer orders, recording them accurately, and calculating the total bill using various tools like cash registers, multi-counting machines, or pencil and paper. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality.

- The task involves interacting with customers, understanding their orders, and performing basic arithmetic calculations to compute bills. These are manual and interactive tasks that do not primarily rely on text-based information processing.
- While the LLM could potentially assist in generating scripts for customer interactions or providing guidance on handling various scenarios, the core aspects of taking orders and calculating bills are more practical and hands-on.
- The LLM may not have a direct interface to input customer orders or interact with physical tools like cash registers or counting machines.
- The task does not involve complex data analysis, specialized domain knowledge, or document summarization that would significantly benefit from the LLM's capabilities.

Considering these points, the task of requesting and recording customer orders, and computing bills for Fast Food and Counter Workers is best classified as E0 - No exposure to LLM.
