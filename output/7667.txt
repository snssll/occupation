1: In this task, a Human Resources Specialist is required to inform job applicants of various details such as duties, compensation, benefits, schedules, working conditions, and promotion opportunities. To determine the appropriate exposure label for this task:

- The task involves providing information to job applicants, which can be done effectively by utilizing the LLM to generate clear and informative responses.
- The LLM can assist in drafting detailed and tailored messages to convey the necessary information to applicants.
- The task does not involve any specialized domain knowledge or complex databases that would require additional software beyond the capabilities of the LLM.
- While the task may involve some level of personalization based on individual applicant needs, the LLM can still significantly reduce the time needed to draft these communications.

Based on these considerations, the task of informing job applicants of details aligns best with the E1 exposure label as direct access to the LLM can reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality by at least half.
