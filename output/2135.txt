1: In this task, a Textile Knitting and Weaving Machine Setter, Operator, or Tender is required to clean, oil, and lubricate machines using various tools and equipment. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be completed more efficiently with the help of the LLM. Since this task involves physical actions such as using air hoses, cleaning solutions, rags, oil cans, or grease guns, it does not directly involve text input or output that the LLM can assist with. The task is more manual and practical in nature, requiring hands-on work rather than text-based processing. Therefore, the LLM or any tools built on top of it would not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task.
