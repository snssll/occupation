1: In this task, a Postal Service Mail Carrier is required to report any unusual circumstances concerning mail delivery, including the condition of street letter boxes. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves observing and reporting specific details related to mail delivery, such as unusual circumstances and the condition of street letter boxes. This task does not involve complex text transformation, summarization, or specialized knowledge retrieval that would significantly benefit from the capabilities of a large language model. The task is straightforward and does not require extensive text generation or analysis beyond basic reporting. Therefore, the task does not align with the criteria for E1, E2, or E3 exposure labels. It falls under E0 as it does not clearly benefit from the use of an LLM to reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete the task.

2: E0

3: High
