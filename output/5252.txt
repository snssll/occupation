1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of developing, implementing, and evaluating methods of data collection as a Sociologist, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be impacted by the use of the LLM.

- Developing methods of data collection: The LLM can assist in generating questions for questionnaires or interviews based on specific criteria provided by the Sociologist. It can help in brainstorming and structuring questions effectively.

- Implementing methods of data collection: The LLM can aid in drafting scripts for interviews or questionnaires, ensuring clarity and coherence in the data collection process.

- Evaluating methods of data collection: The LLM can assist in analyzing the effectiveness of the data collection methods by providing insights into the quality of questions, potential biases, and suggestions for improvement.

Considering these points, the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes for a Sociologist to complete the task of developing, implementing, and evaluating methods of data collection with equivalent quality. Therefore, this task falls under label E1 - Direct exposure.
