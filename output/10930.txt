1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of operating washing machines and dryers to clean soiled apparel and towels as a Locker Room, Coatroom, and Dressing Room Attendant, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be impacted by the use of a large language model (LLM).

- E1: Direct exposure - In this case, the task involves a straightforward and specific action of operating washing machines and dryers. An LLM could potentially provide guidance on the best practices for operating these machines, troubleshooting common issues, or even generating maintenance schedules. The LLM could also assist in documenting the cleaning process or providing safety instructions. Overall, the task can be significantly streamlined with the direct assistance of an LLM.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the task itself is relatively simple and may not require additional software beyond the LLM, it is conceivable that specialized software could be developed to optimize laundry operations in a locker room setting. This software could integrate with the LLM to provide real-time updates on machine status, inventory management, or predictive maintenance alerts. Although not essential for the basic task of operating washing machines and dryers, such applications could enhance efficiency and effectiveness in a larger operational context.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities would not significantly impact the task of operating washing machines and dryers for cleaning apparel and towels. This task is primarily text-based and does not involve detailed visual analysis or image processing.
