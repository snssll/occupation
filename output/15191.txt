1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of reviewing, classifying, and recording survey data in preparation for computer analysis as a Survey Researcher, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be impacted by the use of an LLM.

- This task involves working with text data (survey responses) and organizing it for analysis. An LLM can assist in tasks related to organizing and summarizing text data efficiently.
- The LLM can help in categorizing and structuring the survey data based on predefined criteria, which can save time compared to manual classification.
- The LLM can also assist in generating summaries or insights from the survey data, which can aid in the analysis process.
- While the task involves some level of data processing and organization, it may not require highly specialized domain knowledge that would fall under E2.
- The task does not involve image processing or detailed visual analysis, so it does not fall under E3.

Based on these considerations, the task of reviewing, classifying, and recording survey data in preparation for computer analysis as a Survey Researcher would likely fall under label E1, as the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality by assisting in text processing and organization.
