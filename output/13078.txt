1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of producing rough and finished graphics and graphic designs as an Audio and Video Technician, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM in assisting with graphic design tasks. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM can assist in generating text-based content, providing feedback on written documents, and potentially even generating simple graphics based on textual descriptions. However, the LLM does not have direct graphic design capabilities, so it cannot fully replace the skills and tools needed for producing graphics and graphic designs.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While it is conceivable that additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to assist with graphic design tasks, such software would need to have advanced image processing capabilities that the LLM itself does not possess. This would involve features like image editing tools, design templates, and graphic design algorithms, which are beyond the current capabilities of the LLM.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - The LLM, when combined with image capabilities, can assist in tasks like reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images. However, the LLM's image capabilities are limited to basic image recognition and captioning, and it cannot perform detailed graphic design tasks.

Based on the above analysis, the task of producing rough and finished graphics and graphic designs as an Audio and Video Technician would fall under E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications, as it is conceivable that specialized software could be developed to assist with graphic design tasks, but such capabilities are not currently available directly through the LLM.
