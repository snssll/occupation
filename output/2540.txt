1: In this task, a Regulatory Affairs Specialist is required to communicate with regulatory agencies regarding various regulatory matters. This task involves a significant amount of written communication, including drafting emails, letters, and other forms of written correspondence. An LLM could assist in drafting these communications by providing suggestions for language, structuring the content, and ensuring compliance with regulatory language and requirements. The LLM could also help in summarizing complex regulatory information, generating questions to ask regulatory agencies, and providing feedback on draft submissions. Overall, the LLM could streamline the communication process and enhance the quality of written interactions with regulatory agencies.

Considering the nature of the task and the potential for the LLM to significantly reduce the time and improve the quality of written communication with regulatory agencies, I would classify this task as E1.
