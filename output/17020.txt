1: In this task, the occupation of coroners involves testifying at inquests, hearings, and court trials. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. Testifying at legal proceedings requires a deep understanding of legal procedures, case details, and the ability to communicate effectively in a legal setting. While an LLM could potentially assist in preparing testimony by providing information on relevant laws, regulations, and case precedents, the actual act of testifying involves human judgment, interpretation, and communication skills that are not easily replicable by an AI model. Additionally, the nuances of legal proceedings, cross-examination, and the emotional aspects of court trials require human expertise and experience. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it involves a high degree of human interaction, legal expertise, and communication skills that cannot be effectively replaced by an LLM.
