1: In this task, an Airfield Operations Specialist is required to assist in responding to aircraft and medical emergencies. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be supported by the capabilities of the LLM.

- E0: This task involves responding to real-time emergencies, which require immediate physical action and decision-making. The LLM, even with its text-based capabilities, cannot physically assist in responding to emergencies or make real-time decisions in such critical situations.

- E1: While the LLM can provide information on emergency response procedures, it cannot physically assist in responding to emergencies. The task involves practical, hands-on actions that cannot be directly performed by the LLM through text-based interactions.

- E2: It is conceivable that software could be developed to provide guidance on emergency response procedures based on the LLM's text capabilities. However, the real-time nature of emergency response and the need for physical assistance make it challenging to fully automate this task using the LLM alone.

- E3: The task does not involve image processing or detailed visual analysis, so the image capabilities of the LLM are not relevant in this context.

2: E0
