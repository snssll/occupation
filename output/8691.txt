1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of keeping records of material or equipment usage for Operating Engineers and Other Construction Equipment Operators, we need to consider how the task can be completed with the help of an LLM.

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** An LLM can assist in writing and maintaining records of material or equipment usage by providing templates, suggesting formats, or even generating parts of the records based on input data. The model can help organize and summarize the information efficiently, reducing the time needed for manual data entry and organization.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While an LLM alone can streamline the process of record-keeping, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to further enhance this task. For example, specialized applications could be created to automatically extract relevant data from equipment logs or maintenance reports, making the record-keeping process even more efficient.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Image capabilities are not directly relevant to the task of keeping records of material or equipment usage. This task primarily involves text-based data entry and organization, which can be effectively handled by an LLM without the need for image processing capabilities.

Based on the above analysis, the most suitable label for the task of keeping records of material or equipment usage for Operating Engineers and Other Construction Equipment Operators is **E1 (Direct exposure)**.
