1: In this task, a food server in a non-restaurant setting is responsible for clearing tables after meals are finished by removing trays and stacking dishes for return to the kitchen. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality. 

- The task of removing trays and stacking dishes is a physical task that requires manual labor and cannot be automated by the LLM.
- The task does not involve complex instructions, writing, summarizing, analyzing data, or any other text-based activities that the LLM could assist with.
- There is no need for language translation, document retrieval, or specialized domain knowledge that the LLM could provide.
- The task does not involve any image-related activities that would require the capabilities of the LLM with image processing.

Based on these considerations, it is clear that the task of removing trays and stacking dishes for return to the kitchen does not benefit from exposure to the LLM in any way, as the LLM cannot perform physical tasks or automate manual labor.
