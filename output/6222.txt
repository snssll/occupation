1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of establishing and supervising peer-counseling and peer-tutoring programs as an Educational, Guidance, and Career Counselor or Advisor, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. 

- The task involves setting up and overseeing programs within an educational setting, which requires a deep understanding of counseling and educational principles.
- The LLM can provide general information on peer-counseling and peer-tutoring programs, offer insights on best practices, and potentially generate ideas for program structures based on existing knowledge.
- However, the task also involves practical implementation, coordination with students and staff, and ensuring the programs meet specific educational goals and standards, which may require human judgment and interaction.
- While the LLM can assist with generating program guidelines and providing theoretical knowledge, it may not significantly reduce the time needed for the hands-on aspects of establishing and supervising such programs.

Based on these considerations, the task falls under E2 - Exposure by LLM-powered applications. While the LLM can offer valuable insights and information related to peer-counseling and peer-tutoring programs, additional software specifically tailored to educational program management would be needed to significantly reduce the time required to complete this task.
