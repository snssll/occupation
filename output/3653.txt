1: In this task, a Food Batchmaker is responsible for cooling food product batches on slabs or in water-cooled kettles. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if access to the LLM or LLM-powered tools can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality.

- E0: This task involves physical actions such as cooling food product batches, which cannot be automated or assisted by the LLM. The task requires manual labor and does not involve text-based or image-based processing that the LLM can assist with.

- E1: The task does not involve writing, transforming text, summarizing documents, or any other text-based activities that the LLM can directly assist with. Therefore, the LLM cannot reduce the time it takes to complete this task by at least half.

- E2: While it is conceivable that specialized software could be developed to assist with managing batch cooling processes in food production facilities, such software would likely involve complex data analysis, real-time monitoring, and physical automation systems. The LLM alone would not be sufficient to reduce the time it takes to complete this task by half.

- E3: The task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images. Therefore, the image capabilities of the LLM would not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task.

Based on the above analysis, the most appropriate label for this task is E0.

2: E0

3: High
