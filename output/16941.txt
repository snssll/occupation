1: In this task, a Web Administrator is responsible for testing issues related to system integration, performance, and system security regularly or after major program modifications. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if the task can be significantly expedited or improved by using the LLM. 

- The task involves technical knowledge and hands-on testing of web systems, which may not be directly aided by the LLM.
- While the LLM could potentially provide information on best practices for system testing or security measures, the actual testing process itself requires practical application and technical expertise.
- The LLM may not have the ability to directly interact with the web systems to perform the testing tasks required by a Web Administrator.
- The task does not involve writing or transforming text, providing edits, summarizing documents, or any other text-based activities where the LLM excels.

Based on these considerations, it is unlikely that the task of testing web system issues for integration, performance, and security can be significantly expedited or improved by the LLM. Therefore, this task falls under label E0.

2: E0

3: High
