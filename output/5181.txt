1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of developing specifications for vehicles powered by alternative fuels or alternative power methods as an Automotive Engineer, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be aided by the use of a large language model (LLM).

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** If the task involves writing and transforming text to develop detailed specifications for alternative fuel vehicles, the LLM could significantly reduce the time needed to research and draft these specifications. The LLM can assist in providing technical details, regulations, and best practices related to alternative fuels and power methods, thereby expediting the specification development process.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While an LLM alone may not reduce the time to complete the task by half, additional software built on top of the LLM could enhance the process. For instance, specialized applications could be developed to retrieve up-to-date information on the latest alternative fuel technologies, regulations, and industry trends, which could then be integrated into the specification development process.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Image capabilities would not significantly impact the task of developing specifications for alternative fuel vehicles, as the task primarily involves text-based research, analysis, and documentation. Image capabilities are more relevant for tasks involving detailed visual information or design aspects, which are not the focus of this particular task.
