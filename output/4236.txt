1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of demonstrating or explaining products as a Demonstrator and Product Promoter, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be aided by the use of a large language model (LLM).

- Demonstrating or explaining products involves communication skills, persuasion techniques, and product knowledge. An LLM could potentially assist in generating scripts or persuasive language to use during demonstrations.
- The task may also involve answering customer questions about the products or services being promoted. An LLM could help provide accurate and detailed information to address customer inquiries.
- Additionally, an LLM could aid in summarizing key features or benefits of products/services to streamline the demonstration process.

Considering these points, the task of demonstrating or explaining products as a Demonstrator and Product Promoter could benefit from the use of an LLM to enhance communication, provide information, and streamline the demonstration process. Therefore, this task falls under label E1 - Direct exposure.
