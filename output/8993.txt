1: In this task, the Credit Authorizers, Checkers, and Clerks are responsible for mailing charge statements to customers. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The task of mailing charge statements to customers involves a straightforward process of sending out physical or digital statements. The LLM could potentially assist in generating the text for these statements, ensuring accuracy and clarity in the communication. The LLM could also help in personalizing the statements based on customer data available. Overall, the LLM could significantly reduce the time it takes to draft these statements with equivalent quality by providing templates, language suggestions, and customization options.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the task itself is relatively simple and may not require advanced LLM capabilities beyond text generation and personalization, it is easy to imagine additional software that could be developed on top of the LLM to streamline the process further. For example, an application that integrates customer data, payment history, and communication preferences to automatically generate and send out personalized charge statements could enhance efficiency. Such a system could leverage the LLM's text generation abilities along with data processing capabilities to optimize the mailing process.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - This task does not involve image processing or detailed visual content, so the image capabilities of the LLM are not directly relevant in this context.
