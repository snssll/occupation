1: In this task, an Occupational Therapy Assistant is responsible for assembling, cleaning, or maintaining equipment or materials for patient use. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. Assembling, cleaning, or maintaining equipment requires physical interaction and manipulation of objects, which cannot be directly performed by an LLM. The task does not involve writing, summarizing text, or any other activity that can be easily automated by an LLM. Therefore, this task falls under the category of tasks that require physical actions and cannot be significantly aided by an LLM.
