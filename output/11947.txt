1: In this task, a Librarian or Media Collections Specialist is required to plan and teach classes on various topics related to information literacy, library instruction, and technology use. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves creating educational content, structuring lesson plans, and delivering instruction to students. While an LLM could potentially assist in generating content for the classes, providing information on information literacy, library instruction, and technology use, it may not significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to plan and teach these classes. The task also involves interactive elements such as teaching and engaging with students, which may not be effectively replaced by an LLM. Therefore, the task does not seem to fit into categories E1 or E3, as direct access to the LLM or image capabilities would not significantly reduce the time to complete the task. However, it is conceivable that additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to assist in creating educational materials or structuring lesson plans, potentially reducing the time needed for these aspects of the task. Therefore, the task aligns more closely with category E2, where additional software could be developed to enhance the efficiency of planning and teaching classes on the specified topics.
