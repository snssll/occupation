1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of executing or managing social media campaigns to inform search marketing tactics as a Search Marketing Strategist, we need to consider the level of exposure to LLM.

- E1: Direct exposure - In this task, the Search Marketing Strategist may benefit from using the LLM to generate ad copy, analyze social media trends, or provide insights on search marketing strategies based on the data gathered. The LLM can assist in writing and transforming text, providing feedback on campaigns, and generating questions for optimization. The direct access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete these tasks with equivalent quality.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not reduce the time to complete the task by half, additional software built on top of the LLM could enhance the efficiency of managing social media campaigns. This software could summarize large amounts of data, provide recommendations based on trends, or analyze written information to inform decisions, thereby improving the overall effectiveness of search marketing strategies.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not directly relevant to the task of executing or managing social media campaigns. Therefore, this task does not fall under E3.

Based on the considerations above, the task of executing or managing social media campaigns to inform search marketing tactics aligns best with E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications.
