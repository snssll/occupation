1: In this task, a boilermaker is required to bolt or arc weld pressure vessel structures and parts together using wrenches or welding equipment. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves physical actions such as welding and using wrenches, which cannot be directly performed by an LLM.
- The task requires hands-on skills and expertise in working with equipment, which are not within the capabilities of an LLM.
- The task does not involve text-based inputs or outputs that can be easily processed by an LLM.
- There is no information retrieval, analysis, or decision-making based on text that an LLM can assist with in this task.

Based on these considerations, it is clear that the task of bolting or arc welding pressure vessel structures and parts together is not something that can be significantly aided by an LLM. Therefore, the appropriate label for this task is E0.

2: E0

3: High
