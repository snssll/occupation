1: In this task, a butcher or meat cutter is responsible for preparing and placing meat cuts and products in a display counter to make them visually appealing to customers. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. This task involves visual aesthetics and presentation skills, which are not directly related to text-based interactions that an LLM excels at. While the LLM could potentially provide written guidance on how to arrange the meat cuts or suggest marketing strategies, the core aspect of physically arranging the products in a visually appealing manner is not something the LLM can directly assist with. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not significantly benefit from the capabilities of the LLM.
