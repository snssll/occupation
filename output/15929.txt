1: In this task, a slaughterer and meat packer is responsible for preparing carcasses for further processing or packaging by shaving or singeing, defeathering, and washing them. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves physical actions such as shaving, singeing, defeathering, and washing carcasses, which cannot be directly performed by an LLM. Additionally, the task requires hands-on work and precise physical movements, which are not within the capabilities of the LLM. As a result, this task falls under E0 as it does not involve text-based or information processing activities that can be significantly aided by an LLM.
