1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of evaluating new technologies to enhance or complement current research as a Molecular and Cellular Biologist, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can benefit from the use of a large language model (LLM).

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** If the task involves researching and summarizing information about new technologies, the LLM can significantly reduce the time needed to gather relevant data, analyze it, and provide insights. The LLM can help in understanding complex scientific concepts, identifying key features of technologies, and even generating reports or summaries based on the input provided. This direct access to the LLM can streamline the process of evaluating new technologies for molecular and cellular biology research.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the LLM alone can assist in information retrieval and analysis, additional software built on top of the LLM could further enhance the evaluation process. For example, specialized applications could be developed to retrieve up-to-date information on cutting-edge technologies, provide recommendations based on data analysis, or even simulate the potential impact of integrating new technologies into current research practices. These applications could offer more tailored insights and suggestions, making the evaluation process more efficient.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Since the task of evaluating new technologies primarily involves text-based research and analysis in the field of molecular and cellular biology, image capabilities may not significantly impact the completion of this task. The focus is on understanding the scientific principles and implications of new technologies rather than visual data interpretation.

Based on the considerations above, the task of evaluating new technologies to enhance or complement current research as a Molecular and Cellular Biologist aligns most closely with **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications)**. While the LLM can provide valuable assistance in information retrieval and analysis, the development of specialized software on top of the LLM could further optimize the evaluation process for this task.
