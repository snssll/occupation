1: In this task, a farmworker is required to direct and monitor the work of casual and seasonal help during planting and harvesting. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves overseeing and managing the work of other individuals, which requires human interaction, decision-making, and physical presence on the farm. While the LLM could potentially provide guidance on best practices for managing workers or offer suggestions on how to improve efficiency, the core aspect of supervising and monitoring physical labor cannot be effectively replaced by the LLM alone. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not significantly benefit from the capabilities of the LLM.

2: E0
