1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of developing new principles and relationships between existing mathematical principles as a mathematician, we need to consider the level of assistance the LLM can provide in this specific task. 

- E0: This task involves high-level creative thinking, innovation, and expertise in the field of mathematics. The task requires deep understanding, critical analysis, and originality, which are not areas where the LLM can significantly assist. The LLM may provide general information or basic mathematical concepts, but it cannot replace the expertise and creativity required for this task.

- E1: While the LLM can provide information on existing mathematical principles and concepts, it is unlikely to significantly reduce the time or enhance the quality of developing new mathematical principles. The task of advancing mathematical science through the development of new principles requires specialized knowledge, creativity, and expertise that go beyond what the LLM can offer.

- E2: It is conceivable that additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to assist mathematicians in organizing and summarizing existing mathematical knowledge, retrieving relevant research papers, or even suggesting potential areas for exploration based on existing data. However, the core task of developing new mathematical principles would still heavily rely on the mathematician's expertise and creativity.

- E3: The LLM's capabilities, even when combined with image capabilities, do not significantly enhance the ability to develop new mathematical principles. This task is primarily text-based and requires advanced mathematical reasoning and creativity, which are not areas where image capabilities would provide substantial assistance.
