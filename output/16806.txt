1: In this task, a librarian or media collections specialist is required to teach library patrons basic computer skills, such as searching computerized databases. With access to the powerful OpenAI large language model (LLM), the librarian could potentially use the LLM to generate instructional materials, create interactive tutorials, or even provide real-time assistance to patrons through a chat interface. The LLM could help in summarizing key points for teaching computer skills, generating practice exercises, or even answering specific questions related to computer database searching. Overall, the LLM could significantly reduce the time it takes to prepare for and deliver computer skills training sessions.

Considering these factors, this task falls under E1 - Direct exposure. The LLM can be directly used to assist in creating instructional materials, providing guidance, and answering questions related to teaching basic computer skills to library patrons.
