1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of collecting and analyzing data as an Interviewer, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves studying old records, tallying numbers, and participating in surveys. The LLM can assist in writing and transforming text, summarizing documents, providing feedback on documents, and generating questions. However, the task of collecting and analyzing data requires more than just text-based processing. It involves practical fieldwork, interacting with individuals, and hands-on data collection. While the LLM can help with some aspects like preparing reports or analyzing specific text-based data, it cannot replace the physical data collection aspect of the task. Therefore, the task is best classified as E0 as it involves activities that cannot be significantly expedited by the LLM alone.
