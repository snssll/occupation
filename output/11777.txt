1: In this task, a baggage porter or bellhop is responsible for picking up and returning items for laundry and valet service. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. Since this task involves physical actions of picking up and returning items, it does not directly involve text input or output that can be processed by an LLM. The task requires manual labor and interaction with physical objects, which cannot be substituted by the capabilities of an LLM. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM or any tools built on top of it.

2: E0

3: High
