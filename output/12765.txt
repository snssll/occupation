1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of preparing rooms for meetings and arranging decorations, media equipment, and furniture for social or business functions as a Maid and Housekeeping Cleaner, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. In this case, the task involves physical actions such as arranging furniture and decorations, which cannot be directly performed by the LLM. The LLM can provide information or guidance on how to set up a room, suggest decoration ideas, or offer tips on organizing spaces, but it cannot physically carry out the task. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not significantly benefit from the use of the LLM in reducing the time it takes to complete the task.
