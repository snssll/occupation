1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of preparing and presenting illustrated lectures and interpretive talks about park features as a Park Naturalist, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be aided by the use of a large language model (LLM).

- The task involves creating content for lectures and talks, which can benefit from the LLM's ability to generate text and provide information on various topics related to park features.
- The LLM can assist in researching and summarizing information about specific park features, helping in the preparation of the content for the lectures.
- It can also aid in generating engaging and informative scripts for the presentations, enhancing the quality of the talks.
- While the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time it takes to prepare and present the lectures, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to automate certain aspects of content creation or provide more interactive presentation materials, potentially halving the time needed for the task.

Based on these considerations, the task of preparing and presenting illustrated lectures and interpretive talks about park features as a Park Naturalist falls under label E2 - Exposure by LLM-powered applications.
