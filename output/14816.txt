1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of researching, ordering, and maintaining parts inventory for services and repairs as a Mobile Heavy Equipment Mechanic, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be aided by the use of a large language model (LLM).

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** The task involves a significant amount of text-based work, such as researching parts, ordering them, and maintaining inventory. An LLM could be used to quickly search for parts, compare prices, generate inventory lists, and even automate some aspects of the ordering process. The LLM can assist in writing emails for ordering parts, maintaining records, and providing information on parts specifications.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the task could potentially benefit from additional software that integrates with the LLM to streamline the process further, the core task of researching, ordering, and maintaining parts inventory can already be significantly enhanced by the LLM alone.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Image capabilities are not directly relevant to this task as it primarily involves text-based activities related to parts inventory management.
