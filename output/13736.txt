1: In this task, the main activity involves reading maps and following written or verbal geographic directions. A large language model (LLM) could potentially assist with providing written directions or even verbal instructions. The LLM could generate detailed directions based on the input provided, which could save time compared to manually creating directions. However, the task does not involve complex text transformations, specialized domain knowledge, or image capabilities that would significantly benefit from the LLM's capabilities. Therefore, while the LLM could provide some assistance, it may not reduce the time it takes to complete the task by at least half.
