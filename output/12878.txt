1: In this task, a Procurement Clerk is responsible for preparing, maintaining, and reviewing purchasing files, reports, and price lists. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it more efficiently. 

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** The task involves working with text-based documents such as files, reports, and lists. An LLM could assist in generating, organizing, and reviewing these documents, potentially saving time and improving accuracy. The LLM could help in summarizing reports, cross-referencing information, and even identifying trends in pricing data. Therefore, direct access to the LLM could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the task primarily involves text-based work, there may be additional software developed on top of the LLM that could further enhance the efficiency of preparing and maintaining purchasing files. This software could include features like automated data extraction from reports, real-time price list updates, or intelligent categorization of purchasing information. Such applications could streamline the procurement process and improve decision-making.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Since the task does not involve image processing or detailed visual analysis, the image capabilities of the LLM are not directly relevant in this context.
