1: In this task, the occupation involves fitting and fastening sheet metal coverings to aircraft surfaces. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes for an aircraft assembler to complete this task with high quality. The task involves physical work that requires precision and manual dexterity, such as fitting and fastening sheet metal coverings. The LLM does not have the capability to physically manipulate objects or perform tasks that require physical interaction. While the LLM could potentially provide information on techniques, safety guidelines, or best practices related to aircraft assembly, it cannot directly assist in the physical fitting and fastening of sheet metal coverings.
