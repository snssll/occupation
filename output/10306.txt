1: In this task, a millwright is responsible for moving machinery and equipment using various tools such as hoists, dollies, rollers, and trucks. This task involves physical labor and requires hands-on skills to ensure the safe and efficient movement of heavy machinery. Since the task involves physical movement and manipulation of equipment, it does not directly involve text input or output that can be processed by an LLM. The task does not align with the capabilities of an LLM, as it requires practical skills and physical effort rather than text-based processing. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not benefit from the use of an LLM.
