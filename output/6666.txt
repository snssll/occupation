1: In this task, a First-Line Supervisor of Retail Sales Workers is responsible for examining merchandise to ensure correct pricing, display, and functionality. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves examining merchandise, which is a visual inspection task that requires physical presence and interaction with the products. This task also involves checking pricing, display, and functionality, which may require physical manipulation of the items.
- The task does not involve writing, summarizing documents, providing feedback on written content, or any other text-based activities that could be easily handled by an LLM.
- While an LLM could potentially assist in generating checklists or guidelines for merchandise examination, it cannot physically inspect the items or verify their functionality.

Based on these considerations, the task falls under E0 as it requires physical presence, interaction with physical objects, and cannot be significantly expedited by using an LLM.
