1: In this task, an archivist is responsible for locating new materials, acquiring them, and displaying them. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if the task can be significantly expedited or improved by using the LLM. 

- The task involves locating new materials, which may require searching through various sources, databases, and archives. The LLM could potentially assist in searching for relevant information, suggesting sources, or summarizing existing materials related to the acquisition process.
- Acquiring new materials may involve negotiating with donors, assessing the value of materials, and ensuring legal compliance. The LLM could provide guidance on legal aspects, draft communication for negotiations, or offer insights into the value of certain materials based on historical data.
- Displaying materials could benefit from the LLM by generating descriptions, historical context, or exhibition labels based on the content of the materials.

Considering these points, the task of locating new materials, directing their acquisition, and display could be significantly enhanced by the LLM, particularly in terms of research, drafting communication, and generating content related to the materials.
