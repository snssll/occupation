1: In this task, a Light Truck Driver is required to use and maintain tools or equipment found on commercial vehicles, such as weighing or measuring devices. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality.

- E0: This task involves physical interaction with tools and equipment on commercial vehicles, such as weighing or measuring devices. The task requires hands-on work and precise measurements, which cannot be effectively replaced by the LLM or any software built on top of it. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM.
