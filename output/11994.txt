1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of planning or developing applications for electronic properties as an Electronics Engineer, we need to consider the level of exposure to LLM. In this task, an Electronics Engineer would typically need to analyze technical specifications, understand electronic components, and design modifications to improve performance. The LLM could assist in providing information on the latest electronic properties, suggesting modifications based on current trends, or even generating code for specific applications. Since the task involves technical knowledge and expertise, the LLM could be used to enhance the engineer's work by providing insights, generating ideas, or assisting in the design process. Therefore, this task falls under E2 - Exposure by LLM-powered applications, as additional software could be developed to further streamline the process by leveraging the capabilities of the LLM.
