1: In this task, the occupation of roofers involves installing attic ventilation systems. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes for a roofer to complete the task with high quality. Roofers require physical skills, knowledge of construction techniques, and safety protocols to properly install ventilation systems. This task involves working with physical materials, measuring, cutting, and installing components in a specific manner. The LLM, even with its text-based capabilities, cannot physically install ventilation systems or provide real-time guidance on construction techniques. Therefore, the task of installing attic ventilation systems is not suitable for automation or assistance by the LLM.
