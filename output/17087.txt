1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of tracking and maintaining records for wind operations as a Wind Energy Operations Manager, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves recording and monitoring various data related to wind operations, which can be time-consuming and require attention to detail.

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM can assist in writing and organizing the records based on the provided information. It can help in summarizing data, generating reports, and maintaining records efficiently.
- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time to complete the task, additional software could be developed to automate data entry, analyze trends, and provide insights based on the recorded information.
- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not relevant for this task as it primarily involves text-based data entry and record-keeping.

Based on the above analysis, the task of tracking and maintaining records for wind operations aligns best with label E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications.

2: E2

3: Moderate
