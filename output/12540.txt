1: In this task, a Computer Numerically Controlled (CNC) Tool Programmer is required to prepare geometric layouts from graphic displays using computer-assisted drafting software or drafting instruments and graph paper. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The LLM can assist in tasks that involve writing, transforming text, providing edits, and generating content based on complex instructions. However, the task of preparing geometric layouts from graphic displays is more technical and specialized, requiring knowledge of drafting software and instruments. While the LLM could potentially provide some general information on drafting or assist with basic drafting tasks, it may not have the specialized knowledge or capabilities to fully automate the preparation of geometric layouts from graphic displays. Therefore, this task falls under E2 exposure, as additional software could potentially be developed on top of the LLM to enhance its capabilities for this specific task.
