1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of overseeing the preparation and care of the remains of people who have died as a Mortician, Undertaker, or Funeral Arranger, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be impacted by the use of a large language model (LLM).

- The task involves overseeing the preparation and care of deceased individuals, which requires a high level of human interaction, sensitivity, and expertise in handling the deceased and interacting with grieving families.
- While an LLM could potentially assist in generating documentation, forms, or informational materials related to funeral arrangements, the core task of physically preparing and caring for the deceased cannot be effectively automated by text-based AI alone.
- The task also involves emotional support, cultural sensitivity, and adherence to legal and ethical guidelines, which are aspects that require human judgment and empathy.

Based on these considerations, the task of overseeing the preparation and care of the remains of people who have died is best classified as E0 - No exposure to LLM.
