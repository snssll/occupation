1: In this task, a Nuclear Monitoring Technician is responsible for decontaminating objects by cleaning them with soap or solvents, or by using abrasive methods like wire brushes, buffing wheels, or sandblasting machines. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if the task can be completed more efficiently with the help of an LLM.

- The task involves physical actions such as cleaning and using machinery like sandblasting machines, which cannot be directly assisted by an LLM.
- While the technician may need to refer to guidelines or safety protocols, the task itself does not heavily rely on complex written instructions or data processing that an LLM could significantly assist with.
- The task does not involve writing, summarizing documents, providing feedback, or any other text-based activities that an LLM could directly aid in completing.

Based on these considerations, it is clear that the task of decontaminating objects as a Nuclear Monitoring Technician falls under E0 as it does not benefit from exposure to an LLM.

2: E0
