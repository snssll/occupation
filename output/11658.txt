1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of performing routine maintenance or making minor repairs to equipment in biomass plants as a Biomass Plant Technician, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be aided by the use of a large language model (LLM).

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** If the task involves accessing manuals, technical documents, or specific instructions that can be readily available in text form, the LLM can assist in providing guidance, explanations, or step-by-step procedures for maintenance or repairs. The LLM can help in writing reports, documenting maintenance activities, or even generating troubleshooting steps based on the input provided.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the LLM can assist in providing information and guidance for routine maintenance tasks, the task of making minor repairs may require more specialized knowledge or hands-on experience that the LLM alone may not be able to provide. However, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM that integrates with databases of equipment manuals, repair guides, and real-time troubleshooting assistance to enhance the technician's efficiency in performing repairs.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** This task does not involve detailed visual analysis or image processing that would significantly benefit from image capabilities. The task primarily revolves around mechanical, electrical, or electronic equipment maintenance and repair, which can be effectively addressed through text-based instructions and guidance.
