1: In this task, a surgical assistant is responsible for adjusting and maintaining the operating room environment to meet the surgeon's specifications. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone or with additional software could significantly reduce the time it takes for a surgical assistant to complete this task.

- E0: This task involves physical adjustments to the operating room environment, such as temperature, humidity, and lighting. These adjustments require direct human intervention and cannot be automated by the LLM or any software built on top of it. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not involve text-based or image-related activities that could benefit from LLM capabilities.

- E1: The task does not involve writing, transforming text, summarizing documents, or any other text-based activities that the LLM could directly assist with. It also does not involve image-related tasks that could benefit from the LLM's image capabilities. Therefore, the task does not fit the criteria for E1 exposure.

- E2: While it is conceivable that software could be developed to monitor and adjust operating room conditions based on predefined surgeon specifications, this would involve complex real-time data processing and physical adjustments that go beyond the capabilities of the LLM alone. Therefore, this task does not fit the criteria for E2 exposure.

- E3: The task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images. It also does not require detailed image analysis that would benefit from the LLM's image capabilities. Therefore, the task does not fit the criteria for E3 exposure.
