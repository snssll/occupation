1: In this task, the Stationary Engineers and Boiler Operators are required to test electrical systems to determine voltages using voltage meters. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. Testing electrical systems involves practical, hands-on work that requires physical interaction with the equipment. It involves measuring voltages using voltage meters, which is a technical skill that typically requires physical presence and manipulation of tools. Since this task involves direct physical action and interaction with electrical systems, it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM or any software tools built on top of it. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it cannot be significantly expedited or completed by the LLM.
