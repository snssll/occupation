1: In this task, a Pharmacy Aide is required to operate a cash register to process cash or credit sales. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. Operating a cash register involves basic transaction processing, which does not require complex language understanding or generation. The task is straightforward and does not involve significant text-based interactions or specialized knowledge that would benefit from the capabilities of a large language model. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not significantly benefit from the use of an LLM.
