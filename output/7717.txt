1: In this task, a file clerk is responsible for inputting data into computer systems to support document and information retrieval. With the help of the most powerful OpenAI large language model (LLM), the task could potentially be automated to a certain extent. The LLM could assist in generating templates for data entry forms, providing suggestions for data input based on context, and even cross-referencing information to ensure accuracy. However, since the task involves specific data entry into computer systems, which may require integration with existing databases and systems, as well as potential verification of the accuracy of the input data, the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task by at least half. Therefore, this task falls under the label E2, as additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to streamline the data entry process and enhance efficiency.
