1: In this task, an Occupational Health and Safety Specialist is responsible for coordinating "right-to-know" programs regarding hazardous chemicals or other substances. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

An LLM could potentially assist in providing information on hazardous chemicals, regulations, and best practices related to "right-to-know" programs. The model could help generate written materials, guidelines, or training resources for employees regarding these substances. It could also assist in summarizing complex regulations or guidelines into more understandable formats.

However, the task also involves practical aspects such as implementing the program, ensuring compliance, and interacting with employees and stakeholders. These aspects may require human judgment, communication skills, and on-the-ground implementation that an LLM alone may not be able to handle effectively.

Considering these factors, the task could potentially benefit from the assistance of an LLM in providing information and generating written materials, but it may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with high quality. Therefore, this task falls under label E2 - Exposure by LLM-powered applications.
