1: In this task, a Speech-Language Pathologist is required to teach clients how to control or strengthen tongue, jaw, face muscles, or breathing mechanisms. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes for an average worker to complete this task with equivalent quality. 

Teaching clients to control or strengthen specific muscles involves hands-on, personalized interaction, observation, and physical guidance. This task requires the professional to assess the client's current abilities, provide tailored exercises, and offer real-time feedback on their performance. The task is highly interactive and relies on physical touch and visual observation, which cannot be replicated by the LLM alone. While the LLM could potentially provide general information on exercises or techniques, it cannot replace the personalized, hands-on approach required for this task.
