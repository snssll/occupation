1: In this task, a detective or criminal investigator is required to maintain surveillance of establishments to gather identifying information on suspects. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we can break down the task as follows:

- **Writing and transforming text**: The task involves observing and documenting activities, which could potentially involve writing reports based on the surveillance conducted.
- **Providing edits to existing text**: If there are existing surveillance reports that need to be updated or edited, the investigator may need to make changes based on new information gathered.
- **Answering questions about a document**: The investigator may need to answer questions related to the surveillance reports or provide information based on the observations made.
- **Maintain records of written data**: Keeping detailed records of the surveillance activities, observations, and identifying information obtained from suspects is a crucial aspect of this task.

Considering the nature of the task and the involvement of written documentation and record-keeping, it is evident that access to the LLM could significantly reduce the time required to complete these tasks by assisting in writing reports, providing edits, answering questions, and maintaining records efficiently.
