1: In this task, an audiologist is required to instruct patients, parents, teachers, or employers in communication strategies to maximize effective receptive communication. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves providing guidance and instructions based on specialized knowledge in audiology. While the LLM can provide general information on communication strategies, it may not have the specialized knowledge required to tailor these strategies specifically for individuals with hearing impairments. The task also involves a level of human interaction and personalized instruction that may not be effectively replaced by the LLM alone. Therefore, the task does not seem to fit into categories E1, E2, or E3 as it requires a high degree of human interaction and specialized knowledge that the LLM may not possess.

2: E0

3: High
