1: In this task, an embalmer is responsible for arranging the transportation of the deceased to another state for burial. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone or with additional tools could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality.

- Direct exposure (E1): The task involves logistical coordination and communication to arrange transportation for the deceased. While the LLM could potentially assist in drafting emails or written communications related to the transportation arrangements, the core task of physically transporting the deceased is not something the LLM can directly facilitate. Therefore, the LLM alone would not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task.

- Exposure by LLM-powered applications (E2): It is challenging to imagine additional software built on top of the LLM that could automate or streamline the process of arranging transportation for the deceased to another state. This task involves practical, hands-on coordination that is not easily automated through software. Therefore, the LLM alone or with additional tools may not reduce the time significantly.

- Exposure given image capabilities (E3): Image capabilities would not be relevant for this task as it primarily involves logistical coordination and communication, rather than image processing or analysis.

Based on the above analysis, the task of arranging for transporting the deceased to another state for interment is best classified as E0 - No exposure.

2: E0

3: Certainty level: High
