1: In this task, the Extruding and Drawing Machine Setters, Operators, and Tenders, Metal and Plastic need to change dies on extruding machines based on production line changes. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone or with additional software could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task.

- E0: This task involves physical interaction with machinery and precise adjustments that cannot be performed by the LLM or any software tool. The task requires hands-on work and specialized technical skills that cannot be replicated by text-based AI models.

- E1: While the LLM could potentially provide information on how to change dies on extruding machines, the actual physical task of changing dies requires manual work and technical expertise that cannot be replaced by text-based AI. Therefore, the LLM alone would not reduce the time it takes to complete this task by at least half.

- E2: It is conceivable that additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to provide virtual simulations or step-by-step guides for changing dies on extruding machines. This software could potentially reduce the time it takes to complete the task by half by offering interactive training modules or troubleshooting assistance.

- E3: With image capabilities, the LLM could potentially assist by providing visual aids or diagrams on how to change dies on extruding machines. However, since this task primarily involves physical manipulation of machinery, the impact of image capabilities on reducing the time to complete the task may be limited.
