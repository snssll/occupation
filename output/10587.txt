1: In this task, a New Accounts Clerk is responsible for obtaining credit records from reporting agencies. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it. 

- E0: This task involves interacting with external reporting agencies to obtain credit records, which likely requires human interaction and specific procedures that cannot be automated by the LLM. The task may also involve legal requirements or sensitive information that cannot be handled by the LLM alone.

- E1: The LLM could potentially assist in drafting formal requests for credit records based on provided information. It could help in generating the initial communication to the reporting agencies, but the actual process of obtaining the records would still require human intervention and follow-up.

- E2: While the LLM could be used to draft communication and potentially automate some parts of the process, the task of obtaining credit records involves specialized knowledge, legal considerations, and potentially sensitive information that may not be easily automated by the LLM alone. Additional software that integrates with the LLM and other systems could potentially streamline the process, but it would still require human oversight.

- E3: This task does not involve image capabilities, so E3 does not apply.

Based on the considerations above, the most appropriate exposure label for this task is E2.

2: E2

3: Moderate
