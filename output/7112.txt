1: In this task, the waiter or waitress is responsible for garnishing and decorating dishes before they are served to customers. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality. The task of garnishing and decorating dishes is a hands-on activity that requires physical interaction with food items and plates. The LLM, even with its text-based capabilities, cannot physically garnish or decorate dishes. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not meet the criteria for exposure to LLM capabilities.

2: E0

3: High
