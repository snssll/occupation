1: In this task, a Cooling and Freezing Equipment Operator and Tender is responsible for inserting forming fixtures and starting machines to cut frozen products into measured portions or specified shapes. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone or with additional software could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task.

- E0: This task involves physical actions such as inserting forming fixtures and starting machines, which cannot be directly assisted by the LLM or any software built on top of it. The task also requires hands-on operation of equipment, which cannot be replaced by text-based tools.

- E1: The task description does not involve complex text transformations, writing, summarization, or data analysis that could be significantly expedited by the LLM alone. The physical nature of the task limits the direct applicability of the LLM in completing it.

- E2: While it is conceivable that specialized software could be developed to assist with operating cooling and freezing equipment, the task's reliance on physical actions and machine operation makes it challenging to envision a software solution that could reduce the time to complete the task by half.

- E3: The task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images, which are the capabilities associated with E3 exposure.

2: E0
