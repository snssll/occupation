1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of sharing information about religious issues as a clergy member, we need to consider how the task can be completed with the help of an LLM.

- The task involves writing articles, giving speeches, or teaching about religious issues. An LLM can assist in generating written content for articles, speeches, or teaching materials by providing information, explanations, and insights on religious topics.
- The LLM can help in summarizing complex religious concepts, providing historical context, and generating engaging content for articles or speeches.
- It can also assist in crafting responses to common questions or concerns related to religious issues, thereby aiding in teaching and public speaking engagements.
- While the LLM can provide valuable input and suggestions for content creation, the task of delivering speeches or teaching in person would still require human involvement and cannot be fully automated by the LLM.

Based on these considerations, the task of sharing information about religious issues as a clergy member would fall under label E1 - Direct exposure.

2: E1

3: Moderate
