1: In this task, the occupation involves Physical Therapist Aides or Assistants assisting patients with dressing, undressing, or putting on and removing supportive devices. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality. Since this task involves physical interaction with patients and requires hands-on assistance, it cannot be effectively completed using the LLM or any LLM-powered tools. The task does not involve writing, summarizing, analyzing text, or any other activity that the LLM can assist with. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not benefit from LLM capabilities.
