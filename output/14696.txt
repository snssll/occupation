1: In this task, an Administrative Services Manager is required to represent their work unit at meetings or conferences and act as a liaison for requests or complaints. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves communication, coordination, and representation, which are activities that can be significantly aided by the use of an LLM. The LLM can help in drafting communication, preparing for meetings, responding to requests or complaints, and providing guidance on how to effectively act as a liaison. The model can generate responses, draft emails, summarize information for meetings, and provide suggestions on how to handle requests or complaints. Therefore, this task can benefit from direct exposure to the LLM, as it can assist in various aspects of communication and coordination, ultimately reducing the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality.
