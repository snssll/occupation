1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of planning and designing transportation or hydraulic systems or structures as a Civil Engineer, we need to consider the level of exposure to LLM. In this task, the Civil Engineer uses computer-assisted design tools, which may involve complex instructions, transforming text, and providing edits to existing designs. The task also requires specialized knowledge in civil engineering principles and practices. While the LLM could potentially assist in providing information or generating text related to civil engineering concepts, it may not significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced Civil Engineer to complete the task with high quality. The task involves technical expertise and domain-specific knowledge that may not be effectively replaced by the LLM alone.
