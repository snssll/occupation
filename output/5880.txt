1: In this task, a Phlebotomist is required to draw blood from arteries using arterial collection techniques. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. Drawing blood from arteries is a highly specialized skill that involves precise techniques to ensure patient safety and accurate sample collection. This task requires hands-on training, knowledge of anatomy, and adherence to strict protocols to avoid complications. The task does not involve text input or output that can be easily processed by an LLM. Additionally, the task involves physical interaction with patients and the use of medical equipment, which cannot be replicated by an LLM. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of an LLM or any tools built on top of it.
