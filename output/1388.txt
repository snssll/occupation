1: In this task, a helper production worker is required to attach slings, ropes, or cables to objects like pipes, hoses, or bundles. This task involves physical interaction with objects and requires manual dexterity and spatial awareness. The task does not involve complex decision-making, critical thinking, or extensive knowledge beyond basic instructions. Since the task is primarily manual and does not involve text-based information processing, it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM. The LLM cannot physically interact with objects or perform tasks that require physical manipulation. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not benefit from LLM capabilities.

2: E0
