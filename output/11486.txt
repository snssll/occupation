1: In this task, a photographer is required to perform general office duties such as scheduling appointments, keeping books, and ordering supplies. These tasks involve administrative work that is primarily text-based and does not require specialized domain knowledge related to photography. An LLM could assist in generating appointment schedules, maintaining records of appointments, managing bookkeeping tasks, and creating supply orders based on specified criteria. The LLM could also help in drafting emails for appointment confirmations, sending reminders, and communicating with suppliers. Overall, the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete these administrative tasks by providing templates, generating text, and assisting in communication.

Based on the above analysis, this task falls under the E1 category as direct access to the LLM can reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality by at least half.
