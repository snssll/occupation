1: Music therapists often need to stay updated on the latest research findings in the field to ensure they are providing the best care to their clients. In this task, applying selected research findings to practice involves interpreting and implementing the latest research in music therapy techniques. The task does not explicitly require drawing up-to-date facts from the internet or other sources, as the research findings are assumed to be provided. While the LLM could potentially assist in summarizing research articles or providing insights on how to apply the findings, the task itself does not heavily rely on the LLM's capabilities beyond text processing. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not significantly benefit from the LLM's capabilities beyond what a human could do without it.
