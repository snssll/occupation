1: In this task, an Automotive Body and Related Repairer is required to remove small pits and dimples in body metal using pick hammers and punches. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. This task involves physical work that requires manual dexterity and precision. It does not involve text input or output, and the context is primarily focused on metalworking techniques rather than information processing. As such, this task does not align with the capabilities of the LLM, as it cannot perform physical tasks or provide hands-on repair work. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not benefit from the capabilities of the LLM.
