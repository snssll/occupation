1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of conducting social research as a Child, Family, and School Social Worker, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be supported by the capabilities of the OpenAI large language model (LLM).

- Conducting social research involves gathering, analyzing, and interpreting data related to social issues, policies, and programs that affect children, families, and schools.
- The LLM can assist in providing information on research methodologies, data analysis techniques, and theoretical frameworks relevant to social research.
- The LLM can generate literature reviews, summarize research findings, and help in formulating research questions.
- However, the LLM may not have access to up-to-date data or specific research studies unless provided in the input.
- The task may require specialized domain knowledge and expertise in social work, which the LLM may not possess to the same extent as a human expert.
