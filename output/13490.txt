1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of providing technical assistance to installers in the field of solar energy installation, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be supported by the capabilities of the LLM. In this case, the task involves providing technical guidance and support to professionals working on solar electric systems, solar thermal systems, electrical systems, or mechanical systems. The LLM could potentially assist in this task by providing information on best practices, troubleshooting techniques, or specific technical details related to solar energy systems. The LLM could generate text-based instructions, explanations, or recommendations based on the input provided about the specific technical issues faced by the installers. While the LLM may not have direct access to real-time data or specialized domain knowledge in the field of solar energy installation, it can still offer general technical guidance and information that could be helpful to the installers.
