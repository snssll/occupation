1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of collaborating with product development teams as a Financial Quantitative Analyst, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be supported by the capabilities of the LLM.

- Financial Quantitative Analysts require a deep understanding of financial markets, quantitative modeling, and structured solutions.
- Collaborating with product development teams involves researching, modeling, validating, and implementing quantitative solutions for new or expanded markets.
- The task involves complex financial data analysis, modeling, and decision-making based on quantitative information.

Given these considerations, the task of collaborating with product development teams as a Financial Quantitative Analyst is highly specialized and requires domain-specific knowledge. While the LLM can assist with generating text, providing information, and potentially some basic analysis, it may not have the specialized financial knowledge and quantitative modeling capabilities required for this task. The task involves a level of expertise and decision-making that goes beyond what the LLM can provide on its own.
