1: Telemarketers are responsible for explaining products or services, providing pricing information, and answering customer questions over the phone. This task involves a significant amount of verbal communication and persuasion skills. To determine the appropriate exposure label for this task in relation to the LLM, we need to consider the capabilities of the model. The LLM can assist in generating scripts, providing information about products or services, and even simulating customer interactions to help telemarketers practice their responses. The model can also offer suggestions on how to handle common customer queries effectively. However, the task of telemarketing also requires real-time interaction, tone modulation, and the ability to adapt to customer responses, which the LLM may not be able to fully replicate. While the LLM can provide valuable support in preparing for calls and generating responses, it may not completely replace the need for human telemarketers due to the nuanced nature of customer interactions.
