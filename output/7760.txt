1: In this task, a flight attendant is responsible for inspecting and cleaning cabins to ensure they are in order and problem-free. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we can break down the task:
- The task involves inspecting and cleaning cabins, which requires physical presence and interaction with the environment. This task cannot be completed solely through text input and output.
- While the task description can be understood and summarized by an LLM, the actual execution of inspecting and cleaning cabins involves physical actions that the LLM cannot perform.
- The task does not involve complex data analysis, specialized domain knowledge, or the need for up-to-date facts that the LLM could provide.
- There is no text-based information retrieval or generation required beyond the task description itself.

Based on these considerations, the task falls under E0 as it involves physical actions and human interaction that cannot be replaced by an LLM.
