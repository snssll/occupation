1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of teaching students, dancers, and other performers about rhythm and interpretive movement as a choreographer, we need to consider the nature of the task and how an LLM could potentially assist in completing it.

- E1: Direct exposure - An LLM could assist in providing resources, lesson plans, and instructional materials related to rhythm and interpretive movement. It could help in generating written content for teaching guides, explanations, or even choreography notes. The LLM could also aid in answering questions related to dance theory, history, or specific movements.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While an LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time it takes to teach students about rhythm and interpretive movement, additional software could be developed to create interactive dance tutorials, virtual choreography demonstrations, or personalized feedback based on individual performances. This software could enhance the teaching process and make it more efficient.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities would not significantly impact the task of teaching rhythm and interpretive movement to students, as the focus is on physical movement and instruction rather than visual aids or detailed images.
