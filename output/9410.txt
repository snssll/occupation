1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of making promotional appearances at public or private events as a Broadcast Announcer or Radio Disc Jockey, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it. 

- E0: This task involves physical presence and interaction at events, which cannot be replaced by the LLM. The task requires the individual to represent their employer in person, which is not something the LLM can do.

- E1: The LLM could potentially assist in drafting promotional scripts or speeches for the announcer or disc jockey to use during their appearances. It could also help in preparing talking points or responses to common questions. However, the core aspect of physically attending events and interacting with the audience cannot be replaced by the LLM.

- E2: While the LLM could potentially help in generating promotional content or scripts, the task of making promotional appearances at events involves a significant amount of human interaction and engagement that goes beyond the capabilities of the LLM alone. Additional software that could be developed on top of the LLM might help in organizing event schedules or managing promotional materials, but the core task of representing the employer at events would still require human presence.

- E3: The task of making promotional appearances at events does not involve image processing or analysis, so the image capabilities of the LLM would not significantly impact the completion of this task.

Based on the above analysis, the most appropriate label for this task is E1.

2: E1

3: Moderate
