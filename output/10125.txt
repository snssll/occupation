1: In this task, a psychiatric technician is required to monitor patients' physical and emotional well-being and report any unusual behavior or physical ailments to medical staff. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be significantly aided by the use of the language model. The task involves observing and reporting on patients' conditions, which is primarily a hands-on and observational task that requires human judgment and interaction. While the LLM could potentially assist in generating reports or documenting observations, the core of the task involves direct human observation and interaction, which cannot be fully replaced by the model. Therefore, the task does not align with the capabilities of the LLM to a degree that would significantly reduce the time needed to complete it.
