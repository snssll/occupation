1: For the task of cleaning, stocking, and restocking workstations and display cases as a Fast Food Cook, we need to consider the nature of the task. This task involves physical actions such as cleaning and restocking, which cannot be directly performed by an LLM. While the LLM could potentially provide written instructions or guidelines on how to efficiently clean and restock, the actual execution of the task would still require human intervention. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not involve text-based activities that can be significantly expedited by the LLM.
