1: In this task, a landscaping and groundskeeping worker is responsible for providing proper upkeep of various outdoor features such as sidewalks, driveways, parking lots, fountains, planters, burial sites, and other grounds features. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if access to the LLM or LLM-powered tools can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality.

- E0: This task involves physical work outdoors that requires manual labor and direct interaction with the environment. The task of providing upkeep to outdoor features like sidewalks, driveways, and planters cannot be effectively automated or completed by text-based tools like the LLM. Therefore, this task does not benefit from LLM exposure.
