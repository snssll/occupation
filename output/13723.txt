1: For the task of preparing and cooking food according to instructions in a fast-food setting, the exposure to LLM can be evaluated as follows:

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM could potentially assist in providing recipes, cooking instructions, or clarifications on specific cooking techniques. It could also help in translating instructions if needed. However, the task of physically preparing and cooking the food would still require manual labor and cannot be entirely automated by the LLM.
- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to streamline the process. For example, an application that integrates with the LLM to provide real-time translations of instructions or automate certain aspects of food preparation based on standard recipes.
- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities would not significantly impact the task of preparing and cooking food in a fast-food setting, as the primary focus is on following written or verbal instructions rather than visual cues.

Based on the above analysis, the task of preparing and cooking food according to instructions in a fast-food setting would likely fall under E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications.
