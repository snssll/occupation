1: In this task, a Library Assistant is required to answer routine inquiries from patrons and refer those in need of professional assistance to librarians. The task involves providing information, directing patrons, and potentially engaging in basic interactions. With the help of a large language model (LLM), the Library Assistant could quickly access and provide answers to common inquiries, draft responses to routine questions, and potentially even generate scripts for directing patrons to librarians. The LLM could also assist in drafting email responses or preparing written materials for patrons. However, the task does not involve complex decision-making, specialized domain knowledge, or detailed data analysis that would require additional software beyond the capabilities of the LLM. Therefore, the task falls under E1 as the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality by providing text-based assistance and support.
