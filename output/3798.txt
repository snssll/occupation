1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of coordinating with outside staffing agencies to secure temporary employees as a Human Resources Specialist, we need to consider the level of automation and assistance that the LLM can provide in completing this task. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM can assist in writing and transforming text, providing edits, summarizing documents, answering questions, and maintaining records of written data. In this task, the LLM could potentially help draft emails to staffing agencies, summarize candidate profiles, or maintain records of temporary employees. However, the task involves coordination with external agencies, which may require human judgment and negotiation skills beyond what the LLM can provide directly.
  
- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time to complete this task, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to streamline the process. For example, an application could be created to analyze candidate profiles, recommend suitable matches based on departmental needs, or even automate some communication with staffing agencies.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities would not significantly impact the completion of this task, as it primarily involves text-based communication and coordination with external agencies.

Based on the considerations above, the task of coordinating with outside staffing agencies to secure temporary employees as a Human Resources Specialist is best classified as E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications.
