1: In this task, a Library Assistant, Clerical, is required to take action to deal with disruptive or problem patrons. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. Dealing with disruptive or problem patrons involves human interaction and requires real-time decision-making based on various factors such as the specific situation, the behavior of the patron, and the policies of the library. This task does not involve text input or output that can be easily processed by an LLM. Additionally, the task may require physical intervention or communication skills that cannot be replicated by an LLM. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM or any tools built on top of it.
