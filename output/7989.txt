1: In this task, an umpire, referee, or sports official is required to inspect sporting equipment or examine participants to ensure compliance with event and safety regulations. With the help of the LLM, the task cannot be directly completed as it involves physical inspection and interaction with participants. The LLM does not have the capability to physically inspect equipment or individuals. Additionally, the task requires real-time judgment and decision-making based on visual and physical cues, which the LLM cannot provide. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it cannot be significantly aided by the LLM.
