1: In this task, a veterinary technologist or technician is responsible for scheduling appointments and procedures for animals. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM can assist in completing it. 

- The task of scheduling appointments and procedures involves organizing and managing appointments, which can be done efficiently through text-based communication.
- The LLM can help in generating appointment schedules, reminders, and communicating with pet owners or veterinarians via written correspondence.
- The LLM can also assist in maintaining records of appointments, procedures, and any relevant information.
- While the task does not involve complex decision-making or specialized domain knowledge, the LLM can streamline the administrative aspect of scheduling appointments.

Based on these considerations, the task of scheduling appointments and procedures for animals can be significantly expedited and improved in quality with the assistance of the LLM, reducing the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality by at least half. Therefore, the appropriate exposure label for this task is E1.
