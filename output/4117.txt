1: In this task, a Musical Instrument Repairer and Tuner is required to cut out sections around cracks on percussion instruments to prevent the cracks from advancing. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. This task involves physical actions such as cutting with shears or grinding wheels, which cannot be directly performed by an LLM. The task also requires hands-on skills and knowledge of musical instrument repair techniques, which are not typically within the capabilities of an LLM. Therefore, this task falls under the category of tasks that require physical actions and specialized manual skills, making it unsuitable for automation or assistance by an LLM.
