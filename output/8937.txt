1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of locating and supplying materials to masons for installation, following drawings or numbered sequences, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be aided by the use of a large language model (LLM).

- The task involves understanding instructions (drawings or numbered sequences) and locating specific materials accordingly. This can be translated into text input for the LLM to process.
- The LLM can assist in interpreting the drawings or sequences and providing guidance on where to find the materials based on the information provided.
- It can also help in generating lists or instructions for the masons based on the input received.
- The task does not involve precise measurements or detailed visual analysis, which are limitations for the LLM.

Based on these considerations, the task can be significantly aided by the LLM's ability to process text input, provide guidance, and generate relevant information based on the instructions given. Therefore, the task falls under label E1 - Direct exposure.
