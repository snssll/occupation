1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of conducting presentations of analytic findings as an Intelligence Analyst, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The task involves presenting analytic findings, which may require creating slides, structuring information, and potentially incorporating visual aids. The LLM can assist in generating text-based content for the presentation, providing insights, and helping with the organization of information. It can also help in crafting compelling narratives to convey the findings effectively. Therefore, the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to prepare for such presentations with equivalent quality by at least half.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone can assist in generating content for the presentation, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to provide more advanced features such as summarizing complex data sets, creating visual representations of data, or even generating presentation slides directly. These capabilities could further enhance the efficiency of preparing and delivering presentations as an Intelligence Analyst.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not directly relevant to the task of conducting presentations of analytic findings. This task primarily involves text-based content and potentially visual aids in the form of slides, which can be effectively handled by the LLM without the need for detailed image analysis.

Based on the above analysis, the task of conducting presentations of analytic findings as an Intelligence Analyst is best classified as E1: Direct exposure.
