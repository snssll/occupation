1: In this task, the occupation of Fallers involves measuring felled trees and cutting them into specified log lengths using chain saws and axes. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality. The task involves physical actions such as measuring and cutting trees, which cannot be directly performed by the LLM. The LLM does not have the capability to interact with physical objects or perform tasks that require precise measurements or physical labor. Therefore, the task does not align with the capabilities of the LLM, and there are no tools built on top of the LLM that can assist in completing this task. As a result, this task falls under E0 as it does not meet the criteria for exposure to the LLM.

2: E0
