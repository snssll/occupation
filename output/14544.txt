1: In this task, the Outdoor Power Equipment and Other Small Engine Mechanics are required to repair or replace defective parts using hand tools. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if the task can be significantly expedited or improved by using the LLM. Since the task involves physical repair work with hand tools, it does not involve text input or output that the LLM can directly assist with. The LLM cannot physically repair or replace parts, so it cannot directly reduce the time it takes to complete this task.
