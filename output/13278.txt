1: In this task, the treasurer or controller is responsible for providing guidance and support to other departments within an organization on accounting, budgeting policies, and efficient financial resource management. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be significantly aided by the use of the language model. The LLM can assist in generating written guidance, policies, and procedures related to accounting and budgeting. It can also help in summarizing complex financial information, providing recommendations based on data analysis, and even drafting communication materials to convey financial strategies effectively. As the task involves a significant amount of text-based communication and information processing, the LLM can streamline these processes and enhance the efficiency of providing direction and assistance.
