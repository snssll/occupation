1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of monitoring and evaluating survey progress and performance as a Survey Researcher, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be aided by the use of a large language model (LLM).

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** The task involves analyzing data related to survey progress and performance, which can benefit from the LLM's ability to process and interpret text-based information. The LLM can assist in calculating response rates, interpreting sample disposition reports, and providing insights based on the data analyzed. The LLM can also help in generating reports or summaries based on the survey data.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the LLM can assist in analyzing text data and providing insights, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to automate the process further. This software could include features like real-time monitoring of survey progress, predictive analytics on response rates, or automated generation of performance reports.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Since the task primarily involves text-based data analysis and reporting, image capabilities are not essential for completing this task. Therefore, this task does not fall under E3.

Based on the above analysis, the task of monitoring and evaluating survey progress and performance as a Survey Researcher aligns most closely with **E1 (Direct exposure)** as the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to analyze survey data and generate insights.
