1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of promoting and selling nail care products as a Manicurist and Pedicurist, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves creating promotional content, interacting with customers, and potentially providing information about the products. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM can assist in writing promotional content, crafting sales pitches, and providing information about nail care products. It can generate text for advertisements, product descriptions, and customer interactions, which can significantly reduce the time needed to create these materials compared to manual writing.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone can help with generating text, additional software could be developed to analyze customer preferences, recommend products based on trends, or even provide real-time sales support. Such applications could further enhance the efficiency of promoting and selling nail care products.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not directly relevant to this task as it primarily involves text-based promotional activities rather than image creation or analysis.
