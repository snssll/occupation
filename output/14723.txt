1: For the task of requisitioning necessary supplies, equipment, or services as a First-Line Supervisor of Passenger Attendants or Personal Service Workers, the exposure to LLM can be evaluated as follows:

- E1: Direct exposure - The task involves writing and transforming text to create requisition orders for necessary supplies, equipment, or services. The LLM can assist in drafting these orders based on specific requirements and details provided by the supervisor. The LLM can generate text based on the input criteria, ensuring accuracy and completeness in the requisition process.
  
- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM can assist in generating text for requisition orders, additional software could be developed to streamline the process further. This software could potentially integrate with inventory management systems, analyze historical data to predict future needs, or automate the requisition process based on predefined criteria. Such applications could enhance efficiency and decision-making in requisitioning supplies.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not directly relevant to the task of requisitioning supplies, equipment, or services. This task primarily involves text-based communication and documentation, making image capabilities less impactful in this context.

Based on the above analysis, the task of requisitioning necessary supplies, equipment, or services as a First-Line Supervisor of Passenger Attendants or Personal Service Workers aligns most closely with E1: Direct exposure to LLM.
