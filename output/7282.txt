1: In this task, the occupation involves installing drywall panels on metal frameworks in large buildings. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. Hanging drywall panels involves physical work that cannot be directly performed by an LLM. The task requires manual labor, adjusting panel heights using lifts or hoists, and working on-site in buildings. Since the task involves physical actions and does not primarily rely on text-based or data-driven inputs, it does not align with the capabilities of an LLM. Therefore, the task falls under E0 as it cannot be significantly expedited or improved by the use of an LLM.

2: E0
