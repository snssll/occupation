1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of designing systems for environmental quality control as an Environmental Engineer, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves complex engineering design processes that require specialized knowledge in environmental engineering. The LLM can provide general information on environmental engineering concepts, but it may not have the specific domain knowledge required for detailed design work. While the LLM can assist in generating text or providing general information on environmental engineering principles, it may not significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced environmental engineer to complete the task with high quality. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not clearly decrease the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete the task with high quality by at least half.

2: E0

3: Moderate
