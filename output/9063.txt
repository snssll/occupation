1: In this task, a Marriage and Family Therapist is required to maintain case files that include various components such as activities, progress notes, evaluations, and recommendations. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM can assist in completing it. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM can potentially assist in writing and organizing the content of case files based on provided information. It can help generate progress notes, evaluations, and recommendations based on the data input. However, the LLM may not have direct access to confidential client information, which is crucial for maintaining case files in this context. Therefore, while the LLM can aid in generating text, the actual maintenance of case files may require human oversight and input.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - It is conceivable that specialized software could be developed on top of the LLM to assist Marriage and Family Therapists in maintaining case files more efficiently. This software could potentially automate the organization of information, provide reminders for updating files, and even offer insights or suggestions based on the data input. Such a tool could enhance the therapist's workflow and improve the overall management of case files.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not directly relevant to the task of maintaining case files for Marriage and Family Therapists. This task primarily involves text-based information and does not require image processing or analysis.

Based on the considerations above, the task of maintaining case files for Marriage and Family Therapists could be best classified as E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications.
