1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of fabricating parts needed for assembly or installation as an Aircraft Structure, Surfaces, Rigging, and Systems Assembler, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be impacted by the use of the LLM.

- The task involves fabricating parts using shop machinery or equipment, which requires hands-on skills and knowledge of materials and tools.
- While the LLM can provide information on fabrication techniques, it cannot physically operate machinery or equipment.
- The task does not involve complex decision-making that the LLM could assist with significantly.
- The task is more practical and manual in nature, which may not benefit significantly from the text-based capabilities of the LLM.

Based on these considerations, it is unlikely that the LLM can reduce the time it takes to complete the task of fabricating parts for assembly or installation by at least half. Therefore, this task is best classified as E0 - No exposure.

2: E0

3: High
