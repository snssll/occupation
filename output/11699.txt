1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of performing statistical analysis of environmental data as an Environmental Science and Protection Technician, I will consider the capabilities of the LLM in assisting with this task. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM can assist in writing code for statistical analysis, providing explanations of statistical concepts, and generating reports based on the analysis. It can also help in interpreting results and identifying trends in the data.
- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not reduce the time significantly for performing statistical analysis, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to automate data processing, generate visualizations, and provide recommendations based on the analysis.
- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not relevant for statistical analysis tasks.

Considering the above points, the task of performing statistical analysis of environmental data could benefit from additional software developed on top of the LLM to enhance automation and data processing capabilities, making it suitable for an E2 label.
