1: In this task, an Environmental Restoration Planner is required to notify regulatory or permitting agencies of deviations from implemented remediation plans. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM can assist in completing it. 

- E0: This task involves notifying regulatory or permitting agencies, which may require a high degree of human interaction and legal expertise. The task may involve nuanced communication, understanding of regulations, and potentially sensitive information that may not be suitable for automation.

- E1: The LLM can assist in drafting the notifications to regulatory or permitting agencies by providing language that is clear, concise, and professional. It can help in summarizing the deviations and suggesting appropriate actions to be taken. However, the final decision to notify and the legal implications involved would still require human judgment.

- E2: While the LLM can aid in drafting the notifications, additional software could be developed to automate the process further. This software could potentially retrieve up-to-date regulatory information, analyze the deviations against regulations, and provide recommendations on the necessary steps to take.

- E3: The task does not involve image capabilities, so this label does not apply.
