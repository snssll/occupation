1: In this task, a Demonstrator or Product Promoter is responsible for providing product samples, coupons, informational brochures, or other incentives to persuade people to buy products. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality by at least half.

- Direct exposure (E1): Access to the LLM alone would not directly reduce the time it takes to physically provide product samples, coupons, or brochures to potential customers. This task involves in-person interaction and physical distribution, which cannot be replaced by text-based interactions with the LLM.

- Exposure by LLM-powered applications (E2): While an application could potentially be developed to assist with generating persuasive text for brochures or coupons, the core task of physically providing these materials and interacting with customers in person cannot be significantly expedited by the LLM alone.

- Exposure given image capabilities (E3): Image capabilities would not be relevant for this task as it primarily involves physical interactions and distribution of materials, rather than image-related tasks.

Based on the above analysis, the task of providing product samples, coupons, informational brochures, or other incentives to persuade people to buy products would be best classified as E0 - No exposure.

2: E0

3: High
