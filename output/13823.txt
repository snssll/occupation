1: In this task, the occupation involves baggage porters and bellhops who are responsible for receiving and marking baggage by completing and attaching claim checks. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves a physical aspect of receiving baggage and attaching claim checks, which cannot be directly performed by an LLM or any software tool. The task does not involve complex text transformation, writing, summarization, or data analysis that could benefit significantly from LLM capabilities. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM or any software tool based on it.
