1: In this task, a Maid or Housekeeping Cleaner is required to sort clothing and other articles, load washing machines, and iron and fold dried items. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves straightforward instructions that can be easily understood and executed by an average worker.
- The task does not require specialized domain knowledge beyond basic housekeeping skills.
- The task does not involve complex decision-making or analysis.
