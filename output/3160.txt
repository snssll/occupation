1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of conducting verifications of employment as a Payroll and Timekeeping Clerk, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be impacted by the use of the LLM. 

- Payroll and Timekeeping Clerks typically verify employment by contacting previous employers, HR departments, or using online verification services to confirm an individual's work history and employment status.
- The task involves gathering information, verifying details, and documenting the findings accurately.
- The LLM could potentially assist in drafting verification requests, composing emails, summarizing responses, or providing templates for documentation.
- The LLM could also help in generating standard questions to ask during the verification process or in drafting responses based on received information.

Considering these points, the task of conducting verifications of employment could benefit from the use of the LLM to streamline communication, documentation, and information processing, thereby reducing the time required to complete the task with equivalent quality. This would fall under the category of E1 - Direct exposure.
