1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of developing event topics and choosing featured speakers as a Meeting, Convention, and Event Planner, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be supported by the capabilities of the LLM.

- Developing event topics involves creativity, understanding the target audience, and aligning the topics with the goals of the event. The LLM can assist in generating ideas based on input criteria and providing suggestions for themes or topics.
- Choosing featured speakers requires knowledge of the industry, networking, and understanding the expertise of potential speakers. The LLM can help in researching potential speakers, providing background information, and even drafting communication materials.

Given these considerations, the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task of developing event topics and choosing featured speakers by providing relevant information, generating ideas, and assisting in the decision-making process. Therefore, this task falls under label E1 - Direct exposure.
