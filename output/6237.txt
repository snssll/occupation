1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of establishing functional or system standards as a Computer Systems Engineer/Architect, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be aided by the use of a large language model (LLM).

- Computer Systems Engineers/Architects are responsible for designing and implementing complex computer systems. Establishing functional or system standards involves creating guidelines and specifications for how these systems should operate, ensuring they meet operational requirements, quality standards, and design constraints.
- With access to an LLM, a Computer Systems Engineer/Architect could potentially use the model to research and gather information on existing standards and best practices in the field. The LLM could assist in generating drafts of standards documents based on input criteria provided by the engineer/architect.
- The LLM could also help in summarizing and synthesizing information from a wide range of sources to inform the development of comprehensive and up-to-date standards that address operational requirements, quality standards, and design constraints.

Based on these considerations, the task of establishing functional or system standards for Computer Systems Engineers/Architects could be classified as E1 - Direct exposure. The LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to research, draft, and synthesize information for the creation of standards documents, leading to more efficient and effective standards development.
