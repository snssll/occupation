1: In this task, a Pharmacy Aide is responsible for delivering medication to different locations using various means of transportation. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone or with additional software could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task. 

- E0: This task involves physical movement and interaction that cannot be replaced by text-based tools like the LLM. The task requires the actual transportation of medication, which cannot be done through text-based interfaces.

- E1: While the LLM could potentially provide information on medication or transportation routes, the core task of physically delivering medication cannot be completed through text-based interactions alone. The task involves real-world actions that cannot be fully automated by the LLM.

- E2: It is conceivable that additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to optimize delivery routes or provide real-time updates on medication availability. However, the physical aspect of transporting medication would still require human intervention. The LLM could assist in generating documentation or instructions related to the task.

- E3: The task does not involve image processing or detailed visual instructions that would benefit significantly from image capabilities. The core task of delivering medication does not rely on image processing.
