1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of preparing evaluations of software or hardware and recommending improvements or upgrades as a Computer User Support Specialist, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be aided by the use of a large language model (LLM).

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** The task involves analyzing software or hardware, identifying areas for improvement, and making recommendations. An LLM can assist in generating detailed evaluations based on input criteria, providing insights into potential upgrades or improvements, and even suggesting solutions based on existing knowledge. The LLM can help in drafting reports or summaries of evaluations, which can save time and streamline the process of preparing recommendations.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While an LLM can be beneficial in generating text-based content and recommendations, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to enhance its capabilities further. For instance, specialized tools could be created to analyze technical specifications, compare different software or hardware options, or provide detailed insights into the latest trends in technology to support the evaluation process.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Image capabilities are not directly relevant to the task of preparing evaluations of software or hardware. The task primarily involves text-based analysis and recommendations, which can be effectively handled by an LLM without the need for image processing capabilities.
