1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of creating gameplay test plans for internal and external test groups as a Video Game Designer, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves writing detailed plans that outline the testing procedures, objectives, and criteria for evaluating the gameplay experience. The LLM can assist in generating text, providing structured information, and organizing data, which aligns with tasks such as writing and transforming text according to complex instructions, preparing training materials based on general knowledge, and maintaining records of written data. The LLM can also help in formulating clear and concise instructions for the test plans.

Given that the task primarily involves text-based work and does not require precise measurements, human interaction, or detailed visual analysis, the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality. The LLM can generate drafts of the test plans, offer suggestions for improvement, and assist in refining the language and structure of the documents. Therefore, this task falls under the E1 label as direct access to the LLM can expedite the process of creating gameplay test plans.
