1: In this task, a Retail Loss Prevention Specialist is responsible for verifying the proper functioning of physical security systems in a retail environment. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be significantly expedited or improved by using the language model. 

- The task involves physical security systems, which are tangible and require hands-on verification. The LLM does not have the capability to interact with physical systems directly.
- The task does not involve text-based analysis or decision-making that the LLM could assist with.
- While the LLM could potentially provide information on best practices for maintaining security systems, the task itself is more practical and hands-on.

Based on these considerations, the task of verifying the proper functioning of physical security systems in a retail setting would likely fall under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM to significantly reduce the time or improve the quality of completing the task.
