1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of evaluating data processing proposals as a Computer and Information Systems Manager, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be supported by the capabilities of the LLM.

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** The task involves evaluating data processing proposals, which may require analyzing technical details, feasibility, and requirements. The LLM can assist in this task by providing information on best practices, industry standards, and potential challenges in data processing projects. It can also help in generating reports or summaries based on the input data. Therefore, direct access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality by providing relevant insights and recommendations.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the LLM can provide valuable information and insights, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to further enhance the efficiency of evaluating data processing proposals. This software could automate the analysis of proposals, compare them against benchmarks or industry standards, and provide more detailed recommendations based on the specific requirements of the project. Such software could streamline the decision-making process for Computer and Information Systems Managers.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Image capabilities are not directly relevant to the task of evaluating data processing proposals. This task primarily involves analyzing text-based information related to project feasibility and requirements, which can be effectively handled by the LLM without the need for image capabilities.

Based on the above analysis, the most suitable label for the task of evaluating data processing proposals as a Computer and Information Systems Manager is **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications)**.
