1: In this task, a painter in construction and maintenance applies primers or sealers to prepare surfaces for finish coats. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality. 

- The task of applying primers or sealers involves physical work that cannot be directly performed by the LLM.
- The task requires hands-on skills and precision in application, which the LLM cannot provide.
- The LLM does not have the capability to interact with physical surfaces or materials.
- The task does not involve text input or output that the LLM can process to provide assistance.

Based on these considerations, it is clear that the task of applying primers or sealers in construction and maintenance does not have exposure to the LLM's capabilities.
