1: In this task, the occupation involves painters in construction and maintenance. The specific task mentioned is spraying or brushing hot plastics or pitch onto surfaces. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality. 

Given the nature of the task, which involves physical work with hot materials, it is unlikely that the LLM or any tool built on top of it can directly assist in completing the task. The task requires manual labor, precision in handling hot materials, and adherence to safety protocols, which cannot be replaced by text-based AI tools. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not meet the criteria for exposure to LLM capabilities.
