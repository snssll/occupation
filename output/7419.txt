1: In this task, a Non-Destructive Testing Specialist is required to identify defects in concrete or other building materials using thermal or infrared testing. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task and the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves specialized knowledge and skills related to non-destructive testing techniques, particularly thermal or infrared testing. While the LLM can provide general information on non-destructive testing methods, it may not have the specific domain knowledge required to accurately identify defects in concrete or building materials using thermal or infrared testing. The task also involves practical application and hands-on testing, which cannot be performed by the LLM. Therefore, the task does not fall under E1, E2, or E3 categories as the LLM alone cannot significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with high quality.
