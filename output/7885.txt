1: In this task, the Magnetic Resonance Imaging Technologists are required to inspect images for quality using magnetic resonance scanner equipment and a laser camera. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves visual inspection of images captured by specialized equipment, which does not directly involve text input or output. The task also does not require complex text generation, translation, summarization, or any other text-based interactions that an LLM excels at. Additionally, the task involves physical equipment operation and visual assessment, which cannot be directly assisted by an LLM. Therefore, this task does not fall under E1, E2, or E3 exposure labels as the LLM does not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with high quality.

2: E0

3: High
