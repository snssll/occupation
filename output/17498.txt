1: In this task, a Prosthodontist uses bonding technology on the surface of teeth to change tooth shape or close gaps. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves a specialized skill set and knowledge related to dental procedures. The Prosthodontist needs to have expertise in dental bonding techniques, materials, and oral health. The task does not involve text input or output, and it is hands-on, requiring physical interaction with patients and dental tools. The task also does not involve complex decision-making that can be automated by an LLM. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM or any tools built on top of it.
