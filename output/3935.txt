1: In this task, a Billing and Posting Clerk is responsible for creating various billing documents, shipping labels, credit memorandums, or credit forms. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM could assist in generating text for these billing documents, shipping labels, credit memorandums, or credit forms based on provided information. It can help in writing and transforming text according to specific instructions, which aligns with the task of creating these documents.
- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time to complete this task, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to streamline the process further. For example, an application that integrates with existing databases to retrieve relevant information for billing documents could be developed.
- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Since this task primarily involves text-based documents like billing forms and credit memorandums, image capabilities are not directly relevant here.
