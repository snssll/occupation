1: In this task, a Sports Medicine Physician is required to prescribe orthotics, prosthetics, and adaptive equipment to patients. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be facilitated by the use of a large language model (LLM).

- E0: This task involves a high degree of human interaction and requires specialized medical knowledge to assess patients' needs accurately. The decision to prescribe orthotics, prosthetics, and adaptive equipment is based on a thorough evaluation of the patient's condition, which may involve physical examinations, medical history, and specific requirements. The LLM, even though powerful, cannot replace the expertise and judgment required in this task.

- E1: While the LLM can provide general information about orthotics, prosthetics, and adaptive equipment based on existing knowledge, it cannot replace the personalized assessment and prescription process carried out by a Sports Medicine Physician. The task involves a level of expertise and interaction that goes beyond what the LLM can provide.

- E2: It is conceivable that additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to assist Sports Medicine Physicians in gathering up-to-date information on the latest orthotics, prosthetics, and adaptive equipment available in the market. This software could potentially streamline the research process for physicians, but the core task of prescribing these devices still heavily relies on the physician's expertise.

- E3: The task of prescribing orthotics, prosthetics, and adaptive equipment does not significantly benefit from image capabilities. While visual aids may be used in the assessment process, the core of the task involves medical knowledge, patient evaluation, and decision-making that are not primarily image-based.
