1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of identifying issues for research and analysis as a Political Scientist, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be supported by the capabilities of the LLM.

- Political Scientists typically engage in research, analysis, and interpretation of political systems, policies, and trends.
- Identifying issues for research and analysis involves understanding current events, historical context, policy implications, and societal impacts.
- The task may require accessing a wide range of sources, including academic papers, news articles, government reports, and expert opinions.
- While the LLM can provide information and context based on existing knowledge, it may not have real-time data or access to the latest developments unless explicitly provided in the input.
- The LLM can assist in generating ideas, summarizing information, and providing insights based on the input data.

Considering these points, the task of identifying issues for research and analysis as a Political Scientist could benefit from the LLM's capabilities in generating insights, summarizing information, and providing context. However, the task may also require up-to-date information and specialized domain knowledge that the LLM alone may not possess. Therefore, this task falls under E2 - Exposure by LLM-powered applications, as additional software could be developed to enhance the LLM's capabilities in retrieving up-to-date facts, analyzing complex political issues, and providing recommendations based on specialized knowledge.
