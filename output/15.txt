1: In this task, the occupation of Childcare Workers involves accompanying children to and from school, on outings, and to medical appointments. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone or with additional software could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality.

- E0: This task involves physical interaction and supervision of children, which cannot be replaced by the LLM or any software. The task also requires ensuring the safety and well-being of children, which is a human-centric aspect that cannot be automated.
- E1: The task of physically accompanying children and ensuring their safety is not something that can be effectively automated or completed by the LLM alone. While the LLM could potentially provide information or guidance related to medical appointments or outings, the core aspect of physically accompanying children cannot be automated.
- E2: While the LLM could potentially assist in providing information related to school schedules, medical information, or outing ideas, the core task of physically accompanying children cannot be significantly expedited by the LLM alone. However, additional software that integrates with the LLM could potentially streamline the coordination of appointments, schedules, and outing planning, but the physical aspect of the task remains unchanged.
- E3: The task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images, so the image capabilities of the LLM are not relevant to this task.
