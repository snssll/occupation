1: In this task, a Compliance Manager is required to consult with corporate attorneys to address difficult legal compliance issues. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it. 

- E0: This task involves complex legal compliance issues that require expertise and legal knowledge beyond what an LLM can provide. The task also involves human interaction with corporate attorneys, which cannot be replaced by the LLM. Therefore, this task is unlikely to benefit significantly from LLM assistance.

- E1: While the LLM could potentially provide general information on legal compliance issues, it lacks the specialized legal knowledge required to address difficult legal compliance issues. The task also involves human interaction with corporate attorneys, which cannot be replaced by the LLM. Therefore, the LLM alone is unlikely to reduce the time it takes to complete this task by at least half with equivalent quality.

- E2: It is conceivable that additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to assist Compliance Managers in summarizing legal documents, retrieving up-to-date legal information, or providing recommendations based on legal data. This software could potentially enhance the efficiency of the Compliance Manager's consultation process with corporate attorneys. However, the task still heavily relies on human interaction and legal expertise, which limits the extent to which the LLM alone can reduce the time to complete the task by half.

- E3: The task does not involve image capabilities, so exposure to LLM with image capabilities is not relevant in this context.
