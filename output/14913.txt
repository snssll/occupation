1: In this task, a Document Management Specialist is responsible for retrieving electronic assets from a repository for distribution to users. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves accessing and managing electronic documents, which can be text-based. An LLM could potentially assist in retrieving and organizing these documents efficiently by searching for specific keywords, summarizing document contents, or even generating responses to user queries about the documents. However, the task does not involve complex decision-making, specialized domain knowledge, or image processing. Therefore, while the LLM could streamline some aspects of the task, it may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task by half. As a result, this task falls under E2 exposure, as additional software could potentially be developed to enhance the LLM's capabilities for document retrieval and management tasks.
