1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of removing impacted, damaged, and non-restorable teeth as an Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeon, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves a high level of manual dexterity, precision, and real-time decision-making based on the patient's specific condition. The LLM does not have physical capabilities to perform surgery or interact directly with patients. While the LLM can provide information on surgical techniques, risks, and post-operative care, it cannot physically remove teeth. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it requires a high degree of human interaction, precise measurements, and physical skills that the LLM cannot replicate.
