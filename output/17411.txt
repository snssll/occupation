1: In this task, a Shoe Machine Operator and Tender is required to turn screws to regulate the size of staples. This task involves manual dexterity and mechanical skills to adjust the machinery properly. The task does not involve complex text input or output, and the context is primarily focused on the physical manipulation of the machine parts. Since the task does not involve text-based instructions, writing, summarizing, or any form of communication that can be directly assisted by an LLM, it does not fall under E1. Additionally, developing software on top of the LLM to assist in this task would not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task, as it is primarily a hands-on, mechanical task. Therefore, it does not fall under E2 either. The task also does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images, so it does not fall under E3. Hence, the most appropriate label for this task is E0.

2: E0

3: High
