1: In this task, the helper is required to apply protective coverings like masking tape to prevent damage or staining during work processes. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if the task can be significantly expedited or improved by using the LLM. Since this task involves physical actions such as applying masking tape, which cannot be directly assisted by the LLM, it falls under E0. The LLM cannot physically apply masking tape or perform tasks that require physical interaction.

2: E0

3: High
