1: In this task, an Insurance Sales Agent is required to perform administrative tasks such as maintaining records and handling policy renewals. With access to the LLM, the agent could potentially use the model to assist in maintaining records by generating reports, summaries, or reminders based on the data input. The LLM could also help in drafting policy renewal communications or answering common queries related to policy renewals. However, since the task involves a significant amount of data management and administrative work, the LLM alone may not be able to reduce the time it takes to complete the task by at least half. While the LLM could provide some assistance, additional software specifically tailored for insurance administrative tasks could potentially be developed on top of the LLM to significantly enhance efficiency in handling policy renewals and record-keeping.
