1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of developing and delivering training on weather topics as an Atmospheric and Space Scientist, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it.

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM could assist in writing training materials, creating presentations, and generating content related to weather topics. It can help in summarizing information, providing explanations, and even generating quiz questions for the training sessions. This direct text-based assistance could significantly reduce the time needed to prepare the training materials.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone can help with generating text and content, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to provide more specialized training materials, analyze data for the training, or even create interactive simulations for better engagement. These applications could further enhance the efficiency of developing and delivering training on weather topics.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Since the task primarily involves developing and delivering training on weather topics through text and presentations, image capabilities may not play a significant role in this specific task.
