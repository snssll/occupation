1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of obtaining and verifying evidence as a Detective or Criminal Investigator, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves interviewing suspects and witnesses, observing individuals, and analyzing records to gather evidence. The LLM can assist in providing guidance on interview questions, suggesting potential lines of inquiry, summarizing information from records, and even generating reports based on the data provided. However, the LLM cannot physically conduct interviews, observe individuals, or verify evidence in a real-world setting. While it can aid in information processing and analysis, it cannot replace the hands-on investigative work required for this task.
