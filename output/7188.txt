1: For the task of grading students' assignments and exams as a Short-Term Substitute Teacher, the exposure to LLM can be evaluated as follows:

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** The LLM can potentially assist in grading students' assignments and exams by providing feedback on written responses, identifying common mistakes, and even generating model answers. This can significantly reduce the time it takes to grade papers manually, especially for short-term substitute teachers who may not be as familiar with the students' work. The LLM can also help in providing personalized feedback to students based on their responses.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the LLM alone can assist in grading assignments, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to streamline the grading process further. This could include features like automatically scoring multiple-choice questions, analyzing trends in student performance, and generating detailed performance reports.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Image capabilities are not directly relevant to grading students' assignments and exams, as the task primarily involves evaluating written responses rather than images.
