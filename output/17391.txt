1: In this task, the Automotive Service Technicians and Mechanics tune automobile engines to ensure proper and efficient functioning. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. Tuning automobile engines involves a hands-on approach that requires physical interaction with the engine components. It also involves precise adjustments and measurements that cannot be effectively carried out through text-based instructions alone. The task does not involve writing, summarizing documents, or any other text-based activities that could be easily facilitated by an LLM. Therefore, the task falls under E0 as it requires a high degree of human interaction, precise measurements, and physical manipulation of objects.
