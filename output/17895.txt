1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of writing grants to obtain funding for research projects as a Sociologist, we need to consider the level of exposure to LLM. 

- E0: This task involves a high degree of human interaction and decision-making that cannot be fully automated by the LLM. Writing grants often requires a deep understanding of the research project, the funding organization, and the ability to tailor the proposal to specific requirements. The LLM may assist in generating some content, but the overall process involves human judgment and expertise that cannot be replaced by the model.

- E1: While the LLM can assist in generating text for the grant proposal, the task of writing grants involves more than just text generation. It requires domain-specific knowledge, understanding of funding guidelines, and strategic thinking, which the LLM may not fully capture. The LLM can help with drafting sections of the proposal, but the final product would still require significant input and refinement from the Sociologist.

- E2: It is conceivable that additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to streamline the grant writing process for Sociologists. This software could potentially assist in summarizing relevant research, analyzing funding trends, and generating tailored content for grant proposals. However, the complexity of grant writing and the need for human expertise in crafting compelling proposals may limit the extent to which the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time needed for this task.

- E3: The task of writing grants does not directly involve image processing or analysis, so the image capabilities of the LLM would not have a significant impact on completing this task.
