1: In this task, a Laundry and Dry-Cleaning Worker is responsible for cleaning machine filters and lubricating equipment. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. Cleaning machine filters and lubricating equipment involve manual labor and physical interaction with machinery. These actions cannot be directly performed by an LLM or any software tool. The task does not involve complex decision-making, data analysis, writing, or any other activity that could be significantly aided by an LLM. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not benefit from LLM capabilities.
