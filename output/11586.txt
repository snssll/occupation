1: In this task, the ship engineers are required to perform or participate in emergency drills as needed. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes for ship engineers to complete this task. Ship engineers participating in emergency drills involve physical actions, coordination with other crew members, and following specific protocols and procedures that cannot be directly assisted by the LLM. The task does not involve writing, summarizing, analyzing text, or any other activity that the LLM can directly assist with. Therefore, the task does not fall under E1, E2, or E3 exposure labels.

2: E0

3: High
