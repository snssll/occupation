1: For the task of "Post charges against guests' or patients' accounts" typically performed by Cashiers, the exposure to LLM can be evaluated as follows:

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** The task involves a straightforward action of recording charges against accounts. The LLM can assist in generating text or code to document these charges accurately based on provided information. The model can help in transforming text input into the required format for account records. It can also provide edits to existing text or code following specific instructions. Therefore, direct access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the LLM alone can handle the text generation aspect of recording charges, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to automate the process further. This software could potentially retrieve up-to-date information related to charges, cross-check data, and ensure accuracy in posting charges against accounts. Therefore, there is potential for LLM-powered applications to enhance the efficiency of this task.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Image capabilities are not relevant for the task of posting charges against accounts as it primarily involves text-based information and does not require image processing.
