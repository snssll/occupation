1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of conducting environmental, operational, or performance tests on marine machinery and equipment as a Marine Engineer or Naval Architect, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be impacted by the use of the LLM.

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** If the task involves writing reports, analyzing data, or documenting the results of the tests, the LLM could significantly reduce the time needed to complete these written tasks. The LLM could assist in summarizing test results, generating reports, or even providing insights based on the data collected during the tests.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the LLM alone may not directly reduce the time it takes to conduct the physical tests on marine machinery and equipment, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to streamline the data analysis process, provide recommendations based on test results, or even suggest improvements to the machinery based on the performance tests.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Since the task involves conducting tests on machinery and equipment, there may be visual data such as images or diagrams related to the tests. If the LLM had image capabilities to analyze these visuals, it could potentially assist in interpreting the results of the tests or creating visual representations of the data.
