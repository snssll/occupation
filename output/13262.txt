1: In this task, the Gambling Cage Workers are required to provide customers with information about casino operations. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it. 

- E0: This task involves direct human interaction where the Gambling Cage Workers need to communicate with customers face-to-face. The task does not involve complex data analysis or specialized knowledge that the LLM could significantly assist with. Therefore, using the LLM would not reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete the task.

- E1: While the LLM could potentially provide scripted responses or information about general casino operations, the task of providing customers with information may require real-time interaction, empathy, and understanding of customer needs which the LLM may not be able to replicate effectively. Therefore, the LLM alone would not reduce the time it takes to complete the task by at least half with equivalent quality.

- E2: It is conceivable that additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to provide a database of frequently asked questions about casino operations that the Gambling Cage Workers could refer to. This software could potentially assist in quickly retrieving information to provide to customers, but it may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task by half.

- E3: The task does not involve image capabilities, so this exposure label does not apply.
