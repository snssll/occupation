1: In this task, the occupation involves assembling prefabricated parts to form subassemblies in the aircraft industry. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. Assembling prefabricated parts requires manual dexterity, understanding of technical drawings, and adherence to specific assembly instructions. While an LLM could potentially provide written instructions or guidance on the assembly process, the actual physical assembly of parts cannot be done by the LLM. The task does not involve text transformation, complex data analysis, or specialized knowledge retrieval that would significantly benefit from LLM capabilities. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not clearly decrease the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete the task with high quality by at least half.
