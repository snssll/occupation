1: In this task, the Graders and Sorters, Agricultural Products need to weigh products or estimate their weight visually or by feel. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we can analyze the nature of the task. 

- Weighing products or estimating their weight is a physical task that involves handling the products directly, which cannot be done by an LLM.
- The task does not involve text input or output, and the context is based on physical attributes of the products.
- The task requires tactile senses (by feel) which an LLM cannot perform.
- There is no text-based information processing or analysis involved in this task that an LLM could assist with.

Based on these considerations, it is clear that this task falls under E0 as it involves physical actions and does not align with the capabilities of an LLM.
