1: In this task, a Child, Family, and School Social Worker is required to refer clients to community resources for various services and provide concrete information on where to go and how to apply. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves providing specific information and guidance to clients, which can be done effectively through written communication.
- The task does not involve complex decision-making that impacts human livelihood or legal requirements that necessitate human intervention.
- The task does not require precise measurements or detailed visual analysis.
- The task primarily involves written communication and information dissemination, which can be efficiently handled by an LLM.

Based on these considerations, the task can be significantly expedited with the use of an LLM for tasks such as writing and transforming text, providing information, and maintaining records of written data. Therefore, the task aligns with label E1 as direct access to the LLM can reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality by at least half.
