1: In this task, a Nurse Practitioner is required to prescribe medication dosages, routes, and frequencies based on patient characteristics such as age and gender. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM can assist in completing it. 

- E0: This task involves making critical decisions regarding patient care, which require a high level of expertise, knowledge of medical guidelines, and consideration of individual patient factors. The task also involves legal implications and patient safety concerns, which cannot be solely reliant on an LLM.

- E1: While the LLM can provide general information on medication dosages and guidelines, it lacks the ability to consider individual patient factors, such as age and gender, in prescribing medications. The task requires specialized medical knowledge and clinical judgment that goes beyond the capabilities of the LLM.

- E2: It is conceivable that additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to assist Nurse Practitioners in prescribing medications. This software could potentially provide recommendations based on patient characteristics and medical guidelines, but it would still require human oversight and validation due to the critical nature of the task.

- E3: The task does not involve image processing capabilities, so exposure to image capabilities would not significantly impact the completion of the task.
