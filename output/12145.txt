1: In this task, a Surveying and Mapping Technician is required to position and hold vertical rods or targets for theodolite operators to measure angles, distances, and elevations. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves physical actions such as positioning and holding rods, which cannot be directly assisted by an LLM. The task also requires manual labor and physical coordination, which are not within the capabilities of the LLM. As a result, this task falls under E0 as it does not involve text-based activities that can be significantly aided by the LLM.
