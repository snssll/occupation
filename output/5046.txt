1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of developing or implementing recruiting strategies as a Human Resources Specialist, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be aided by the use of the OpenAI large language model (LLM).

- E1: Direct exposure - The task involves analyzing current staffing needs and devising strategies to meet those needs. The LLM can assist in generating ideas for recruiting strategies based on general knowledge and best practices in human resources. It can provide sample strategies, templates, and suggestions for effective recruitment methods. The LLM can also help in drafting communication materials for recruitment purposes.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone can provide general guidance and suggestions for recruiting strategies, additional software built on top of the LLM could enhance its capabilities. This software could include tools for analyzing recruitment data, generating tailored strategies based on specific organizational needs, and providing insights into industry trends and best practices in recruitment.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not relevant for the task of developing or implementing recruiting strategies in human resources.

Based on the above analysis, the task of developing or implementing recruiting strategies as a Human Resources Specialist is best classified as E1: Direct exposure.
