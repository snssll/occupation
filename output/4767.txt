1: In this task, a curator is responsible for developing and maintaining an institution's registration, cataloging, and basic record-keeping systems using computer databases. With the help of an LLM, the curator could potentially receive assistance in organizing and structuring the information, generating reports, and even suggesting improvements to the database system. The LLM could help in writing detailed documentation for the systems, providing insights on best practices, and even automating certain aspects of data entry or retrieval. Overall, the LLM could significantly reduce the time required for these tasks by offering suggestions, generating content, and streamlining the process.

Considering the nature of the task and the potential for the LLM to assist in various aspects of database management and record-keeping, it aligns more closely with E1 exposure. The LLM can directly contribute to writing, transforming text, providing edits, maintaining records, and preparing training materials based on general knowledge, all of which are relevant to the curator's responsibilities.
