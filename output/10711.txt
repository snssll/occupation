1: In this task, an Intelligence Analyst is required to operate surveillance equipment to intercept communications or document activities. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The LLM can assist in tasks that involve text input and output, but it does not have the ability to interact with physical equipment like cameras or radios. The task of operating surveillance equipment requires hands-on skills and real-time decision-making, which are beyond the capabilities of the LLM. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it cannot be significantly aided by the LLM.

2: E0

3: High
