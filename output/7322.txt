1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of hiring and training recruiters and data collectors as a Survey Researcher, we need to consider the level of exposure to LLM. 

- E1: Direct exposure - If the task involves writing job descriptions, training materials, or communication with potential recruits, the LLM could significantly reduce the time needed to complete these tasks by providing templates, suggestions, or even drafting initial versions of the required documents.
  
- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not reduce the time to complete the task by half, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to streamline the recruitment and training process. This software could automate candidate screening, provide personalized training plans, or offer insights into effective recruitment strategies based on data analysis.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities would not significantly impact the task of hiring and training recruiters and data collectors, as it primarily involves text-based activities rather than image processing.

Considering the above points, the task of hiring and training recruiters and data collectors as a Survey Researcher could be best classified as E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications.
