1: For the task of drawing or reading maps in precision agriculture, the use of an LLM could potentially fall under E2 exposure. While the LLM itself may not directly reduce the time it takes to draw or read maps, there could be additional software developed on top of the LLM that could enhance this task. For example, an application that can analyze satellite imagery data and provide insights or recommendations based on that data could be developed using the LLM's capabilities. This application could help in interpreting maps more efficiently and accurately, thus reducing the time needed for this task.
