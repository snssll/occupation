1: In this task, the main responsibility is to clean facilities and equipment used for animal control, such as dog pens and trucks. This task involves physical cleaning and maintenance work, which cannot be directly performed by an LLM. The task does not involve complex decision-making, specialized knowledge, or detailed analysis that would benefit significantly from LLM capabilities. Therefore, there is no clear way for the LLM to reduce the time it takes to complete this task with high quality by at least half. As such, this task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM or any tools built on top of it.

2: E0

3: High
