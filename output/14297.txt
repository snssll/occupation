1: In this task, the Air Traffic Controllers are responsible for relaying crucial air traffic information to control centers. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves communicating specific information accurately and efficiently, which can be done effectively through written or spoken communication. An LLM could potentially assist in generating scripts for communication, summarizing complex information, or even providing suggestions for more effective communication strategies. However, the task does not involve complex data analysis, specialized domain knowledge, or image processing, which would require additional capabilities beyond text generation. Therefore, the task could benefit from the LLM's text generation capabilities to streamline the communication process.
