1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of referring patients to medical specialists, social services, or other professionals as appropriate as a Hospitalist, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. In this case, the task involves understanding the patient's condition, medical history, and needs to make appropriate referrals. The LLM can assist in providing general information about medical specialists, social services, and professionals based on the input provided. It can also help generate referral letters or documents. However, the task also requires specific medical knowledge, understanding of the patient's condition, and expertise in making the right referrals, which the LLM may not have access to. Therefore, while the LLM can provide some assistance in generating referral documents, it may not significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced Hospitalist to complete the task with high quality.
