1: In this task, a Public Relations Specialist is responsible for planning or directing the development or communication of programs to maintain favorable public or stockholder perceptions of an organization's accomplishments, agenda, or environmental responsibility. To determine the exposure label for this task:

- The task involves a significant amount of writing and communication, which can be effectively supported by the LLM. The model can assist in generating communication materials, drafting press releases, crafting messages to maintain a positive image, and more.
- The LLM can provide insights and suggestions on how to effectively communicate with different stakeholders to maintain a positive perception.
- While the LLM alone may not reduce the time to complete the task by half, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to streamline the process further. This software could potentially analyze sentiment, provide data-driven recommendations, or even automate parts of the communication process.

Based on these considerations, the task falls under label E2 - Exposure by LLM-powered applications.
