1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of selecting solar energy products for customers as a Solar Sales Representative and Assessor, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it.

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** The task involves analyzing various factors such as electrical energy requirements, site conditions, and price to recommend suitable solar energy products to customers. The LLM could assist in providing information on different solar products, their specifications, pricing, and potentially even help in analyzing site conditions based on provided data. The LLM could also help in generating reports or summaries based on the input data provided by the assessor.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the LLM alone could provide information and assist in analyzing data, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to streamline the process further. This software could potentially integrate real-time pricing information, up-to-date product specifications, and even customer reviews to aid in the decision-making process.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Image capabilities would not significantly impact the task of selecting solar energy products based on electrical energy requirements, site conditions, and price. This task is more data-driven and analytical, focusing on factors that can be described in text rather than visual information.
