1: In this task, an Inspector, Tester, Sorter, Sampler, or Weigher is responsible for removing defects like chips, burrs, or corroded surfaces. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if the task can be significantly expedited or improved by using the LLM. Since the task involves physical inspection and manual removal of defects, it does not directly involve text input or output that the LLM can process. The LLM cannot physically interact with objects or perform manual tasks like defect removal. Therefore, the task does not align with the capabilities of the LLM, and no exposure label applies.

2: E0
