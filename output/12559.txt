1: In this task, a Self-Enrichment Teacher is required to prepare instructional program objectives, outlines, and lesson plans. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves writing and transforming text according to specific instructions, which is a task that can be effectively completed using the LLM.
- The LLM can assist in generating outlines and lesson plans based on the objectives provided.
- The task does not involve any specialized domain knowledge or up-to-date facts that are not captured in the input.
- The LLM can help in structuring the content and providing suggestions for instructional materials.

Based on these considerations, the task can be significantly expedited and improved in quality by using the LLM, making it suitable for an E1 label.
