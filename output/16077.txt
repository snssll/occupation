1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of specializing in green financial instruments as a Financial and Investment Analyst, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be supported by the capabilities of the LLM.

- This task involves a high level of domain-specific knowledge related to green finance and investment analysis.
- The task requires understanding complex financial instruments like socially responsible mutual funds and ETFs.
- The LLM can provide general information about green finance and investment analysis, but it may not have access to the most up-to-date information on specific green companies or funds unless provided in the input.
- The LLM can assist in generating reports, summaries, or analyses related to green financial instruments based on the input provided.
- While the LLM can help with general information and analysis, it may not have the specialized domain knowledge required to make specific investment recommendations or decisions.

Based on these considerations, the task of specializing in green financial instruments as a Financial and Investment Analyst would likely fall under **E2 - Exposure by LLM-powered applications**. While the LLM can provide general information and assist in generating reports, additional software or tools specifically tailored for analyzing green financial instruments in detail could further enhance the efficiency of completing this task.
