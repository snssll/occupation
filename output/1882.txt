1: In this task, an interpreter or translator is required to check translations of technical terms and terminology to ensure accuracy and consistency throughout the translation process. With the help of a large language model (LLM), the interpreter or translator can easily input the technical terms and phrases to get accurate translations in various languages. The LLM can provide instant translations and suggest alternative translations for technical terms, helping the interpreter or translator ensure accuracy and consistency. This task involves writing and transforming text, providing edits following specifications, and translating text between languages, all of which are capabilities of the LLM. Therefore, this task can be significantly expedited and improved in quality with the assistance of the LLM.
