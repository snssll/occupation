1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of resolving problems or discrepancies concerning customers' accounts as a teller, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The task involves dealing with customer accounts and resolving issues, which may require understanding specific account details, policies, and procedures. The LLM could assist in providing guidance on common account issues, suggesting possible solutions, or drafting responses to customers. However, the task may also involve accessing internal systems, verifying information, and making decisions based on specific account data, which may not be directly supported by the LLM alone.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM could potentially help in generating responses or providing general information on account issues, a more specialized software application tailored to banking procedures and regulations would likely be more efficient in handling account discrepancies. Such an application could integrate with the LLM to retrieve relevant information and suggest specific actions based on banking guidelines.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - This task does not involve image processing or visual content, so the image capabilities of the LLM would not significantly impact the completion of the task.

Based on the considerations above, the task of resolving problems or discrepancies concerning customers' accounts as a teller is best classified as E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications.
