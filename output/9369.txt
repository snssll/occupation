1: In this task, a Fabric and Apparel Patternmaker is required to make adjustments to patterns after fittings. This task involves analyzing the fit of a garment on a model or mannequin, identifying areas that need adjustment, and then modifying the pattern accordingly to ensure a proper fit. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the LLM can significantly aid in this task. 

- The task involves a hands-on approach to physically adjusting patterns based on real-life fittings, which cannot be directly assisted by the LLM.
- The LLM may be able to provide general information on pattern adjustments or sewing techniques, but the specific adjustments needed after fittings are based on real-time observations and measurements.
- While the LLM could potentially provide some guidance on common pattern adjustments, the task primarily requires practical skills and direct interaction with the garment, which the LLM cannot provide.

Based on these considerations, the task of making adjustments to patterns after fittings is best classified as E0 - No exposure to LLM.
