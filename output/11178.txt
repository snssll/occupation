1: Clinical Nurse Specialists participate in clinical research projects by reviewing protocols, patient records, monitoring compliance, and meeting with regulatory authorities. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. In this case, the task involves reviewing protocols, patient records, and compliance, which may require analyzing and synthesizing information. While an LLM could assist in summarizing documents, providing insights, or generating reports based on the data, it may not significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced Clinical Nurse Specialist to complete the task. The task also involves interacting with regulatory authorities, which may require nuanced communication and decision-making that an LLM may not be able to handle effectively. Therefore, the task does not seem to fit into categories E1 or E2. Additionally, the task does not involve any image-related activities, so it does not fall under E3 either. Considering these factors, the task is best classified as E0.

2: E0

3: Moderate
