1: In this task, the occupation involves operating and maintaining finishing machines to work on glass products. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if the task can be significantly expedited or improved by using the LLM. Since the task involves physical actions such as grinding, drilling, sanding, and polishing glass, it does not directly involve text-based or information processing activities that the LLM excels at. The task requires manual dexterity and physical interaction with machinery, which cannot be replaced by the LLM. Therefore, the task does not align with the capabilities of the LLM, and no exposure label from the rubric applies.

2: E0
