1: In this task, the Highway Maintenance Workers are required to perform preventative maintenance on vehicles and heavy equipment. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves hands-on work with vehicles and heavy equipment, which requires physical interaction and technical skills. This type of work cannot be directly completed by an LLM or any software tool.
- The task does not involve text input or output that can be easily processed by an LLM.
- While an LLM could potentially provide information on maintenance procedures or guidelines, the actual execution of preventative maintenance on vehicles and heavy equipment requires physical presence and manual labor, which is beyond the capabilities of an LLM.

Based on these considerations, the task of performing preventative maintenance on vehicles and heavy equipment falls under E0 as it involves physical work that cannot be replaced by an LLM.
