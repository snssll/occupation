1: In this task, a food server working in a non-restaurant setting is responsible for stocking service stations with items like ice, napkins, or straws. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone or with additional software could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality.

- E0: This task involves physical actions such as stocking items, which cannot be directly assisted by the LLM or any software tools. The task also does not involve complex decision-making or specialized knowledge that would benefit from LLM capabilities.

- E1: While the LLM could potentially provide written instructions or checklists for stocking service stations, the physical aspect of the task cannot be directly assisted by the LLM. The task does not involve complex text transformations, translations, or data analysis that would significantly benefit from the LLM's capabilities.

- E2: It is challenging to imagine additional software built on top of the LLM that could automate or streamline the physical task of stocking service stations. The task is straightforward and does not require specialized domain knowledge or complex decision-making that would greatly benefit from LLM-powered applications.

- E3: The task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images, so the image capabilities of the LLM are not relevant here.

2: E0

3: High
