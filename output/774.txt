1: In this task, the Rail Yard Engineers, Dinkey Operators, and Hostlers are required to apply and release hand brakes on rail cars. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality. Since this task involves physical actions such as applying and releasing hand brakes on rail cars, it does not involve text input or output that can be processed by the LLM. The LLM cannot physically interact with the rail cars to apply or release hand brakes. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM.

2: E0

3: High
