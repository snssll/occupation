1: In this task, a Web Administrator is responsible for administering internet or intranet infrastructure, including Web, file, and mail servers. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves managing and maintaining web servers, file servers, and mail servers, which may require technical knowledge and expertise.
- The task may involve troubleshooting issues related to server performance, security, and accessibility.
- The task may also involve configuring server settings, monitoring server activity, and ensuring the smooth operation of the infrastructure.

Given the technical nature of the task and the expertise required, it is unlikely that direct access to the LLM alone would significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality. While the LLM could potentially provide information or guidance on certain aspects of server administration, the complexity and specificity of the task may require additional specialized tools or software tailored to server management.
