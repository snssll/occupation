1: In this task, a Financial Manager is required to communicate with stockholders or investors to provide information or raise capital. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves written communication with stockholders or investors, which can be effectively carried out using the LLM. The LLM can assist in drafting emails, reports, or other written materials to convey information or request capital. The model can help in crafting clear and professional messages, summarizing financial data, and providing responses to inquiries. As the task primarily involves written communication and information sharing, the LLM's capabilities in generating text and responding to queries make it a valuable tool for this task.
