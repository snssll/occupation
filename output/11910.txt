1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of planning and following the most efficient routes for delivering goods as a Courier or Messenger, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. In this case, the task involves analyzing data (route options, distances, traffic conditions) and making decisions based on that analysis to optimize efficiency.

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM can assist in analyzing data related to routes, traffic conditions, and distances to suggest the most efficient routes for delivering goods. It can provide insights and recommendations based on the input data, potentially reducing the time it takes to plan routes.
- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time to complete the task, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to create a route optimization tool. This tool could integrate real-time traffic data, weather conditions, and historical delivery patterns to suggest the most efficient routes.
- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not relevant for this task as it primarily involves data analysis and decision-making based on that data.

Considering the task involves data analysis and decision-making, the most suitable label appears to be E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications.

2: E2

3: Moderate
