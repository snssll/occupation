1: In this task, a Radiologic Technologist or Technician is responsible for maintaining a current file of examination protocols. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be facilitated by the use of the LLM. 

- The task involves organizing and updating examination protocols, which primarily requires textual input and output.
- The LLM can assist in creating, editing, and organizing text-based documents efficiently.
- The task does not involve complex decision-making, precise measurements, or detailed visuals that would require human interaction or specialized tools beyond text processing capabilities.

Considering these points, the task of maintaining a current file of examination protocols can be significantly expedited and improved in quality by using the LLM to assist in organizing, updating, and potentially generating new protocols based on the latest information available.
