1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of negotiating, renegotiating, and administering contracts with suppliers, vendors, and other representatives as a Purchasing Agent, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be aided by the use of a large language model (LLM).

- E1: Direct exposure - In this task, a Purchasing Agent would need to engage in written correspondence to negotiate and administer contracts. An LLM could assist in drafting emails, responses, and contract terms, potentially saving time and improving the quality of communication.
- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While an LLM could be used to draft and refine written communications, additional software could be developed to analyze contract terms, suggest negotiation strategies, or provide insights based on data analysis to enhance the negotiation process further.
- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities would not significantly impact the negotiation and administration of contracts in this context.

Based on the above analysis, the task of negotiating, renegotiating, and administering contracts with suppliers, vendors, and other representatives as a Purchasing Agent would likely fall under E1: Direct exposure.

2: E1

3: Certainty level: High
