1: In this task, a Pest Control Worker is required to spray or dust chemical solutions in various locations to control pests. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if the task can be completed more efficiently with the help of an LLM. 

- The task of spraying or dusting chemical solutions does not involve complex text input or output that would significantly benefit from the language model's capabilities.
- The task is more physical in nature, involving the application of chemicals in specific locations.
- The task does not involve writing, summarizing documents, providing feedback on text, or any other text-based activities that the LLM excels at.
- The LLM cannot physically perform the task of spraying or dusting chemicals.

Based on these considerations, the task of spraying or dusting chemical solutions as a Pest Control Worker falls under E0 as it does not benefit from the capabilities of the LLM in completing the task more efficiently.
