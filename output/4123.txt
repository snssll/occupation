1: In this task, a Tire Builder is responsible for cutting plies at splice points and pressing ends together to form continuous bands. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves physical actions such as cutting and pressing, which cannot be directly performed by an LLM. Additionally, the task requires manual dexterity and physical coordination, which are not capabilities of the LLM. As a result, this task falls under the category of tasks that cannot be significantly aided by the LLM or LLM-powered tools. Therefore, this task would be classified as E0 as it does not meet the criteria for exposure to LLM capabilities.

2: E0

3: High
