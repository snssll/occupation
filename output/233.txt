1: In this task, the Ambulance Drivers and Attendants, Except Emergency Medical Technicians are required to administer first aid, such as bandaging, splinting, or administering oxygen. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality. 

- E0: This task involves hands-on, practical skills that require physical interaction with patients. The task of administering first aid involves assessing the patient's condition, applying appropriate medical techniques, and responding to the patient's needs in real-time. These actions cannot be effectively replaced by text-based interactions with the LLM.

- E1: While the LLM could potentially provide information on first aid procedures, it cannot physically administer first aid. The practical nature of this task requires hands-on skills and immediate responses that cannot be replicated by the LLM alone.

- E2: Developing software on top of the LLM that could assist in providing step-by-step guidance for administering first aid procedures might be possible. However, the real-time nature of administering first aid and the need for physical interaction with patients make it challenging to fully automate this task using the LLM alone.

- E3: The LLM, even with image capabilities, cannot physically administer first aid or interact with patients in a practical setting. While it could potentially provide information on first aid procedures or guidelines, the hands-on nature of this task limits the applicability of image capabilities in this context.
