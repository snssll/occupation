1: In this task, an Animal Caretaker is responsible for finding homes for stray or unwanted animals. To complete this task, the caretaker may need to write descriptions of the animals, communicate with potential adopters, and coordinate adoption processes. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM can assist in writing compelling descriptions of the animals to attract potential adopters. It can also help in drafting communication with interested parties. The model can generate emails, social media posts, or website listings to promote the animals in need of homes. Additionally, the LLM can provide guidance on the adoption process and answer common questions potential adopters may have.
- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone can significantly aid in aspects of this task, additional software could be developed to streamline the process further. For example, an application could be created to automatically match animals with suitable adopters based on preferences and criteria. This software could leverage the LLM's capabilities to analyze and process large amounts of data to make optimal matches.
- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not directly relevant to the task of finding homes for animals. While images of the animals may be included in promotional materials, the primary focus is on written communication and coordination.

Based on the above analysis, the task of finding homes for stray or unwanted animals falls under E1: Direct exposure to the LLM.
