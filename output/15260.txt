1: In this task, a Construction and Building Inspector is required to sample and test air to identify various gases and particulates. This task involves technical knowledge of air quality testing procedures, equipment operation, and interpretation of test results. While an LLM could potentially provide information on air quality testing procedures and the properties of different gases and particulates, it cannot physically sample and test air. The task also involves hands-on work with specialized equipment, which is not something an LLM can perform. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it cannot be significantly aided by the LLM alone.

2: E0
