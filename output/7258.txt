1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of guiding patrons to exits or providing assistance in case of emergency as an Usher, Lobby Attendant, or Ticket Taker, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. In this case, the task involves real-time, physical interaction with patrons in an emergency situation, which cannot be effectively replaced by the LLM. The task requires immediate decision-making, physical presence, and human judgment, which are not within the capabilities of the LLM.
