1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of specializing in regulatory issues related to agriculture, such as green biotechnology crops or genetically altered crops, we need to consider the level of exposure to LLM.

- This task involves a high level of specialization in regulatory affairs related to agriculture, focusing on specific areas like green biotechnology crops and genetically altered crops. The task requires in-depth knowledge of regulations, policies, and practices in these fields.
- The task does not involve direct text input-output interactions that can be easily automated by the LLM. It requires expertise in understanding and interpreting complex regulatory frameworks and staying up-to-date with the latest developments in the field.
- While the LLM could potentially assist in providing general information on regulatory issues in agriculture, it may not significantly reduce the time it takes for a specialist to analyze and interpret specific regulations and policies in this domain.
- Developing software on top of the LLM to summarize complex regulatory documents, provide specialized regulatory insights, or analyze regulatory changes in agriculture could potentially enhance the efficiency of the specialist in this task. However, such software would need to be highly tailored to the specific needs of regulatory affairs specialists in agriculture.
- The task does not involve image processing capabilities or require the use of visual data.

Based on these considerations, the task of specializing in regulatory issues related to agriculture is best classified as E2 - Exposure by LLM-powered applications.
