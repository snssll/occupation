1: In this task, a Computer Systems Engineer/Architect is responsible for directing the installation of operating systems, network or application software, or computer or network hardware. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- E0: This task involves physical installation and coordination, which cannot be directly handled by an LLM or any software tool. It requires hands-on work and human interaction, making it unsuitable for automation by the LLM.
- E1: While the LLM could potentially provide guidance on the installation process through written instructions or troubleshooting tips, the actual physical installation and coordination aspects cannot be automated by the LLM alone. Therefore, the task cannot be completed with equivalent quality by at least half the time with just the LLM.
- E2: It is conceivable that specialized software could be developed on top of the LLM to assist in the installation process by providing detailed step-by-step instructions, troubleshooting guidance, or even virtual simulations. However, as of now, such software does not exist, and the LLM alone cannot significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task.
- E3: Image capabilities would not significantly impact the completion of this task as it does not involve image processing or analysis.

2: E0

3: High
