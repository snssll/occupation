1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of referring applicants to job openings or interviews as an Eligibility Interviewer for Government Programs, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be supported by the capabilities of the LLM.

- The task involves referring applicants to job openings or interviews based on administrative guidelines or office procedures. This task primarily requires understanding and following specific guidelines and procedures set by the government program.
- The LLM can assist in generating text, providing information, and following specific instructions. It can help in drafting referral messages or summarizing guidelines.
- However, the task does not involve complex decision-making, highly specialized domain knowledge, or detailed analysis that would significantly benefit from additional software beyond the LLM.
- While the LLM can provide text-based support, it may not reduce the time significantly for an experienced worker to complete this task, as the core requirement is to follow established guidelines and procedures.
