1: In this task, a Postal Service Clerk is responsible for setting postage meters and calibrating them to ensure they operate correctly. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- Setting postage meters and calibrating them involves technical knowledge and precision to ensure accurate operation.
- The task does not involve complex decision-making or analysis beyond the technical aspects of setting and calibrating the meters.
- While the task may benefit from access to information or guidelines on specific meter models, it primarily requires practical skills and attention to detail.

Based on these considerations, the task of setting postage meters and calibrating them is a technical and hands-on task that does not significantly benefit from the capabilities of an LLM. Therefore, it falls under E0 as the task does not involve writing, transforming text, complex decision-making, or specialized knowledge retrieval that would leverage the LLM's capabilities.
