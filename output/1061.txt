1: In this task, the Ophthalmic Laboratory Technicians are required to assemble eyeglass frames and attach various components using tools like pliers, screwdrivers, and drills. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be significantly expedited or improved by using the language model. Since this task involves physical manipulation of eyeglass frames and components, it does not directly involve text-based instructions or information that the LLM can process. The task does not involve complex decision-making, analysis of written information, or require specialized domain knowledge that the LLM could provide. Therefore, the task does not align with any of the exposure levels E1, E2, or E3.

2: E0

3: High
