1: In this task, a Counter and Rental Clerk is responsible for preparing rental forms, obtaining customer signatures, and collecting necessary information like required licenses. With access to the powerful OpenAI large language model (LLM), the task can be significantly expedited by generating rental forms, drafting the necessary information to be collected, and even providing templates for customer signatures. The LLM can assist in streamlining the process by suggesting standard language for the forms, ensuring completeness of information, and potentially automating certain aspects of the documentation process. Overall, the LLM can enhance the efficiency and accuracy of preparing rental forms and gathering customer information.

Considering the capabilities of the LLM to generate text, provide templates, and assist in formulating documents, this task falls under E1 - Direct exposure. The LLM can directly impact the completion time of the task by providing support in writing and transforming text according to complex instructions, which aligns with the responsibilities of a Counter and Rental Clerk in preparing rental forms and collecting customer information.
