1: In this task, the Fitness and Wellness Coordinator is responsible for teaching fitness classes to improve various aspects of participants' health and fitness. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality. The task involves physical activity, human interaction, and real-time feedback, which cannot be effectively replaced by text-based interactions with the LLM. The LLM does not have the capability to physically demonstrate exercises, provide real-time feedback on form, or interact with participants in a fitness class setting. Therefore, the task does not align with the capabilities of the LLM, and no exposure label applies.
