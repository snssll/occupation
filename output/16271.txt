1: In this task, the occupation involves demonstrators and product promoters who typically engage in activities related to promoting products, demonstrating their use, and interacting with customers. Stocking shelves with products is a common task associated with ensuring that products are readily available for customers to purchase. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete the task of stocking shelves with products. Since this task involves physical labor and manual handling of products, it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM, which is focused on text-based tasks. Therefore, the LLM cannot directly assist in completing this task.
