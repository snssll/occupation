1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of locating and distributing resources to enhance educational programs for Directors of Religious Activities and Education, we need to consider the level of exposure to LLM. This task involves finding and sharing relevant materials to improve educational programs, which could potentially benefit from the capabilities of the LLM in searching for and summarizing information. The LLM could assist in locating resources, providing summaries of periodicals or curricula, and even generating new educational materials based on the input provided. However, since this task does not involve complex data analysis, specialized domain knowledge, or image processing, it may not benefit significantly from additional software beyond the LLM itself. Therefore, the task could be classified as E1 if the LLM alone can reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality by at least half.
