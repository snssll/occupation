1: In this task, the occupation involves preparing metal surfaces or workpieces using hand-operated equipment like grinders, cutters, or drills. This task is very hands-on and requires physical manipulation of tools and materials. The task does not involve text input or output that can be easily processed by a language model. The LLM cannot physically operate the equipment or manipulate the metal surfaces, so it cannot directly assist in completing this task. Therefore, the task does not fall under E1, E2, or E3 exposure categories.
