1: In this task, a Sales Representative is required to estimate or quote prices, credit or contract terms, warranties, and delivery dates. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be significantly expedited or improved by using the language model. 

- The task involves providing estimates, quotes, and terms based on specific criteria, which may require a nuanced understanding of pricing strategies, negotiation tactics, and legal aspects of contracts. 
- The task also involves considering various factors such as market conditions, customer needs, and company policies to provide accurate and competitive offers.
- While the LLM can assist in generating text and providing information, it may not have access to real-time market data, specific company policies, or legal nuances required for accurate pricing and contract terms.
- The LLM may be able to provide general templates or guidelines for pricing and contract terms, but the task may require human judgment and expertise to tailor these to specific situations.

Based on these considerations, the task of estimating or quoting prices, credit or contract terms, warranties, and delivery dates for Sales Representatives is likely to fall under E0 as it involves a high degree of human judgment, negotiation skills, and specific domain knowledge that may not be effectively replaced or significantly expedited by the LLM alone.
