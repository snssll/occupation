1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of setting up and displaying sample merchandise at parties or stands for Door-to-Door Sales Workers, News and Street Vendors, and Related Workers, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. In this task, the worker needs to physically set up and arrange sample merchandise, which involves manual labor and physical presence at the location. The task does not involve complex text input or output that can be significantly aided by the LLM. The LLM cannot perform physical tasks or interact with the physical environment, making it unsuitable for directly assisting in this task. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not benefit from the capabilities of the LLM.

2: E0
