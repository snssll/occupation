1: In this task, a bus driver, school shuttle driver, or chauffeur needs to read maps and follow written and verbal geographic directions. With access to the LLM, the driver could potentially use the model to assist in understanding complex directions, interpreting maps, or even generating alternative routes based on the input provided. The LLM could help in summarizing information related to specific locations or landmarks mentioned in the directions. However, since this task heavily relies on real-time navigation and practical driving skills, the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced driver to complete the task with high quality. While the LLM could provide some assistance in understanding directions, the practical application of driving and navigating would still require human intervention.
