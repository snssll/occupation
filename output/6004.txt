1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of drying prints or negatives as a Photographic Process Worker, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be aided by the capabilities of the LLM. In this case, the task involves a physical process of drying prints or negatives using tools like sponges, squeegees, mechanical air dryers, or drying cabinets. This task is hands-on and requires manual labor, which cannot be directly assisted by the LLM. The LLM does not have the ability to physically interact with objects or perform tasks that involve physical manipulation. Therefore, this task falls under the category of E0 as it does not benefit from the capabilities of the LLM in reducing the time it takes to complete the task.
