1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of writing grant applications to obtain funding as a Molecular and Cellular Biologist, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM in assisting with this task. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM can assist in writing and transforming text according to complex instructions. It can help in drafting the content of grant applications based on the provided information and guidelines. The model can generate text, provide suggestions, and refine the language used in the application.
- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to streamline the process further. This software could potentially summarize relevant research, suggest funding opportunities, or even analyze past successful grant applications to improve the quality of the submission.
- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not relevant for the task of writing grant applications, so this label does not apply.

Considering the above points, the task of writing grant applications to obtain funding as a Molecular and Cellular Biologist could be best classified as E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications.
