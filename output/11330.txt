1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of performing activities that support a team or a specific sport as a Coach or Scout, we need to consider how the task can be completed with the help of an LLM.

- The task involves activities such as participating in community outreach, meeting with media representatives, and appearing at fundraising events. These activities require interpersonal skills, physical presence, and real-time interaction, which cannot be effectively replaced by an LLM.
- While an LLM could potentially assist in drafting written materials for outreach activities or media engagements, it cannot fully substitute for the direct involvement required in these tasks.
- The task does not involve complex data analysis, specialized domain knowledge, or document summarization that would significantly benefit from LLM capabilities.
- The nature of the task is more focused on human interaction and physical presence, which are not areas where an LLM can provide substantial assistance.

Based on these considerations, the task of performing activities that support a team or a specific sport as a Coach or Scout is best classified as E0 - No exposure to LLM.
