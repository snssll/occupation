1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of providing, finding, or arranging support services as a Child, Family, and School Social Worker, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be supported by the capabilities of the LLM.

- This task involves coordinating and arranging various support services for individuals and families to prevent serious problems. The LLM can assist in generating text-based content, providing information, and potentially suggesting resources or services based on the input provided.
- The LLM can help in summarizing information related to different support services, generating text for communication with clients or other professionals, and even providing general advice or recommendations based on the input data.
- While the LLM can be helpful in providing information and generating text, the task of actually finding and arranging specific support services involves a level of human interaction, decision-making, and coordination that goes beyond the capabilities of the LLM alone.
- The task also requires a deep understanding of the specific needs of individuals and families, as well as knowledge of available resources and services in the community, which may not be directly accessible to the LLM.

Based on these considerations, the task of providing, finding, or arranging support services as a Child, Family, and School Social Worker would likely fall under label E2 - Exposure by LLM-powered applications. While the LLM can assist in generating text-based content and providing information, additional software or tools would be needed to significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task by half.
