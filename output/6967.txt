1: In this task, a Coin, Vending, and Amusement Machine Servicer and Repairer is responsible for filling machines with products, ingredients, money, and other supplies. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be significantly expedited or improved by using the language model. Since the task involves physical actions like refilling machines, it does not directly involve text-based activities that the LLM can assist with. The LLM cannot physically interact with machines to fill them, so it cannot directly reduce the time it takes to complete this task.
