1: In this task, the tutor is responsible for preparing and facilitating tutoring workshops, collaborative projects, or academic support sessions for small groups of students. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone or with additional software could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality.

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM could assist in generating workshop materials, creating collaborative project outlines, or drafting academic support session plans based on provided information. It could also help in generating questions, summaries, or feedback for students. However, the task involves a significant amount of human interaction and hands-on facilitation, which the LLM cannot directly assist with. Therefore, the direct exposure to the LLM may not reduce the time significantly for this task.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not reduce the time to complete the task significantly, additional software built on top of the LLM could potentially help in organizing workshop materials, summarizing complex documents related to academic topics, or providing recommendations for collaborative projects. This additional software could streamline the preparation process and enhance the quality of the tutoring sessions.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities would not have a significant impact on preparing and facilitating tutoring workshops, collaborative projects, or academic support sessions for small groups of students. This task primarily involves text-based activities and human interaction, which do not heavily rely on image processing.
