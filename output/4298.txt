1: In this task, a web developer is required to design and implement website security measures like firewalls and message encryption. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- Web developers typically rely on technical knowledge and expertise to implement security measures effectively. While an LLM could potentially provide general information on web security measures, the task of actually designing and implementing these measures requires specialized technical skills and hands-on experience.
- The task involves practical implementation of security measures, which may not be easily reducible to text-based instructions for the LLM to follow. It requires understanding of coding languages, security protocols, and best practices in web security.
- The task also involves ensuring the security measures are tailored to the specific website's needs, which may require domain-specific knowledge and expertise that the LLM may not possess.

Based on these considerations, it is unlikely that the LLM alone or with additional software could significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced web developer to design and implement website security measures with equivalent quality. Therefore, this task is best classified as E0.
