1: In this task, a Library Technician is responsible for claiming missing issues of periodicals and journals. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. Claiming missing issues involves communication with publishers, tracking down missing items, and ensuring the library's collection is complete. This task primarily involves written communication and record-keeping.

Considering the task involves written communication, an LLM could assist in drafting emails to publishers, tracking missing items, and maintaining records of the claims made. The LLM could potentially help in generating templates for claim emails, summarizing responses from publishers, and organizing information related to missing issues.

Given that the task involves a significant amount of written communication and record-keeping, the LLM's capabilities in generating text, summarizing information, and maintaining records could streamline the process and reduce the time required to complete the task. Therefore, this task falls under the E1 label as direct access to the LLM can reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality by at least half.
