1: In this task, a Surveying and Mapping Technician is responsible for setting out and recovering stakes, marks, or other monumentation. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. Setting out and recovering stakes require physical work in the field, which involves precise measurements and spatial awareness. This task does not involve writing, summarizing documents, or any form of text input/output that an LLM could assist with. Additionally, the task does not involve image processing or analysis that an LLM with image capabilities could help with. Since the task is physical and requires manual labor, it does not align with the capabilities of an LLM or any software built on top of it. Therefore, the task falls under E0 as it does not benefit from LLM exposure.
