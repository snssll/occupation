1: Assembling audio and video equipment involves physical tasks such as connecting cables, setting up speakers, adjusting audio levels, and ensuring all equipment is functioning properly. This task does not involve writing, transforming text, or any other activity that an LLM could directly assist with. Additionally, this task requires hands-on work and cannot be completed solely through text-based instructions or communication. Therefore, the task of assembling audio and video equipment does not align with the capabilities of the LLM, and no exposure label (E0) applies.
