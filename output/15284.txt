1: In this task, a teaching assistant in a postsecondary institution is responsible for scheduling and maintaining regular office hours to meet with students. With access to the powerful OpenAI large language model (LLM), the task can be completed more efficiently by generating emails to students to inform them of the office hours, drafting reminders, creating a schedule template, and responding to any inquiries related to the office hours. The LLM can assist in writing and responding to emails, maintaining records of written data, and informing individuals of information via written communication. Therefore, this task falls under the category of E1 as the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality by at least half.
