1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of cleaning or sanitizing work areas, utensils, or equipment as a barista, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task itself is straightforward and does not involve complex decision-making, precise measurements, or detailed visual analysis. The LLM does not have physical capabilities to perform cleaning or sanitization tasks.
