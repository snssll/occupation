1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of installing and configuring new equipment, including operating software or peripheral equipment, for Computer, Automated Teller, and Office Machine Repairers, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be impacted by the use of the LLM.

- E0: This task involves physical installation and configuration of equipment, which requires hands-on work and technical expertise. The task may involve dealing with hardware components, wiring, and troubleshooting physical issues, which cannot be directly assisted by the LLM.

- E1: While the LLM can provide information on software configurations, troubleshooting steps, or general guidance on setting up equipment, the actual installation and physical configuration of hardware components cannot be directly performed by the LLM. The task involves practical skills and hands-on work that go beyond text-based instructions or guidance.

- E2: It is conceivable that specialized software could be developed on top of the LLM to assist in providing detailed step-by-step instructions, troubleshooting guides, or even virtual simulations for training purposes related to equipment installation and configuration. Such software could potentially enhance the efficiency of the repairers in performing their tasks.

- E3: The task does not involve image processing or detailed visual instructions that would significantly benefit from image capabilities in conjunction with the LLM. The task primarily revolves around technical knowledge and hands-on skills related to equipment repair and installation.
