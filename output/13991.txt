1: In this task, a Pest Control Worker is required to recommend treatment and prevention methods for pest problems to clients. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves providing recommendations based on knowledge and expertise in pest control.
- The task does not require accessing up-to-date facts or specialized domain knowledge beyond what a Pest Control Worker would typically possess.
- The task primarily involves written communication with clients to provide recommendations.

Given these considerations, the task does not significantly benefit from the capabilities of an LLM beyond what a Pest Control Worker would already know. While an LLM could potentially assist in generating written recommendations, the core expertise required for this task lies in pest control knowledge and client communication, which the LLM does not enhance in a substantial way.
