1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of coordinating shutdowns and major projects for Petroleum Pump System Operators, Refinery Operators, and Gaugers, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. In this task, the main activities involve planning, organizing, and overseeing the shutdown of equipment and facilities for maintenance or major projects. The LLM could potentially assist in generating detailed project plans, coordinating schedules, communicating with stakeholders, and documenting procedures. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM could help in drafting project plans, scheduling tasks, and communicating effectively through written text. It could also assist in summarizing information and generating reports related to the shutdowns and projects. This direct access to the LLM could significantly reduce the time needed to organize and coordinate these activities.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone could provide valuable assistance, additional software built on top of the LLM could enhance its capabilities further. For example, specialized project management tools that integrate with the LLM could streamline the coordination process, provide real-time updates, and offer data analysis for decision-making during shutdowns and projects.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities would not significantly impact the coordination of shutdowns and major projects in this context, as the task primarily involves text-based communication, planning, and documentation.
