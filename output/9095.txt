1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of maintaining current knowledge of government policy decisions as a Political Scientist, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM in assisting with this task. The LLM can provide information and updates on government policies up to a certain point in time (typically not within the last year unless explicitly provided in the input). However, the task of maintaining current knowledge requires real-time updates and access to the most recent policy decisions, which the LLM alone may not be able to provide without up-to-date information. While the LLM can assist in summarizing and analyzing existing policy documents, it may not have the ability to access real-time data or updates without human intervention or external sources.
