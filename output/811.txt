1: In this task, the helper is required to apply grout between joints of bricks or tiles using grouting trowels. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves manual labor and physical coordination to ensure the grout is applied correctly. This task does not involve complex decision-making, analysis, or specialized knowledge that would benefit significantly from the capabilities of an LLM. The task is straightforward and does not require text input or output, making it unsuitable for direct exposure to an LLM. Additionally, developing software on top of an LLM to assist with this task would not provide a significant time-saving benefit, as the physical aspect of applying grout is essential and cannot be automated by text-based tools.
