1: In this task, an Aircraft Structure, Surfaces, Rigging, and Systems Assembler is required to verify dimensions of cable assemblies or positions of fittings using measuring instruments. This task involves precise measurements that cannot be accurately performed by a language model. The task requires physical interaction with the aircraft components and measuring instruments, which cannot be replaced by text-based instructions or responses. Therefore, this task falls under the E0 category as it cannot be significantly expedited or completed with equivalent quality using an LLM or LLM-powered tool.
