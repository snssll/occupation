1: In this task for Traffic Technicians, the main responsibilities involve gathering and compiling data from various sources such as hand count sheets, machine count tapes, or radar speed checks. They also need to code this data for computer input. With the help of a large language model (LLM), the technician could potentially automate the coding process by providing instructions on how to categorize and input the data. The LLM could assist in generating code snippets or templates based on the data gathered, which could significantly reduce the time required for manual coding.

Considering the nature of the task and the potential for the LLM to automate part of the data coding process, I would classify this task as E1 - Direct exposure. The LLM can assist in transforming text data (the gathered information) into computer code for input, which aligns with the capabilities of the model to write code based on complex instructions.
