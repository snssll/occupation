1: In this task, an animal breeder is responsible for adjusting controls to maintain specific building temperatures required for animals' health and safety. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it. 

- E0: This task involves physical adjustments to control systems in a building to regulate temperatures. It requires hands-on work and direct interaction with the environment, which cannot be replaced by the LLM or any software tools. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not involve text-based or image-based activities that the LLM could significantly assist with.

- E1: The task does not involve writing, transforming text, summarizing documents, or any other text-based activities that the LLM could directly assist with. It is primarily a hands-on task related to building maintenance. Therefore, the LLM would not be able to reduce the time it takes to complete this task by at least half.

- E2: While it is conceivable that specialized software could be developed to monitor and adjust building temperatures automatically based on data inputs and recommendations from the LLM, such software does not currently exist. The task does not involve complex text-based analysis or decision-making that the LLM could directly assist with. Therefore, the task falls under E2 as it could potentially benefit from software developed on top of the LLM to automate temperature control systems.

- E3: The task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images. It is primarily focused on physical adjustments to maintain building temperatures. Therefore, the task does not fall under E3.
