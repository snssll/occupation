1: In this task, the Motorboat Mechanics and Service Technicians are required to perform routine engine maintenance on motorboats, such as changing oil and filters. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality.

- E0: This task involves physical work that cannot be automated by the LLM. It requires hands-on skills and knowledge of motorboat engines, which cannot be substituted by text-based information from the LLM.
- E1: The task of changing oil and filters on motorboats is a practical, hands-on task that cannot be directly assisted by the LLM. While the LLM can provide information on engine maintenance procedures, it cannot physically perform the maintenance tasks required for this occupation.
- E2: While the LLM could potentially provide written instructions or guidelines for engine maintenance tasks, it cannot directly reduce the time it takes to physically perform the maintenance on motorboats. However, additional software could be developed to provide interactive guides or augmented reality tools for mechanics, which could enhance their efficiency in performing tasks like changing oil and filters.
- E3: The task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images, so the image capabilities of the LLM are not relevant in this context.

2: E0

3: High
