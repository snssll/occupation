1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of assessing the usefulness of pre-developed application packages and adapting them to a user environment as a Computer Systems Analyst, we need to consider the nature of the task and how LLM exposure could impact it:

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** If the task involves analyzing and evaluating the functionality of pre-developed application packages based on specific user requirements, the LLM could assist in providing insights, comparisons, and recommendations based on the input criteria. The LLM could also help in generating reports or summaries of the analysis, potentially reducing the time needed for manual evaluation and adaptation.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time to complete the task, additional software built on top of the LLM could enhance the process. For example, an application that can automatically compare user requirements with the features of available application packages, provide recommendations, and even suggest adaptation strategies could streamline the assessment process.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Image capabilities are not directly relevant to the task of assessing and adapting application packages, so this label is not applicable.

Considering the above points, the task of assessing the usefulness of pre-developed application packages and adapting them to a user environment as a Computer Systems Analyst could best fit under **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications)**.
