1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of providing social workers with pertinent information gathered during applicant interviews as an Eligibility Interviewer for Government Programs, we need to consider the nature of the task and how LLM exposure could impact its completion:

- The task involves gathering and relaying information obtained during applicant interviews to social workers. This task primarily involves processing and communicating information in a written format.
- The task does not require specialized domain knowledge beyond what the LLM can provide, as it focuses on relaying gathered information accurately.
- The task does not involve complex decision-making or analysis beyond summarizing and communicating interview information.
- The task does not involve image processing or detailed visual analysis.

Based on these considerations, the task can be effectively completed with the help of an LLM, which can assist in summarizing interview information and generating reports for social workers. The LLM can significantly reduce the time needed to compile and communicate this information accurately.
