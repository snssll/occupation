1: In this task, an Agricultural Technician is required to examine animals or crop specimens to identify diseases or issues. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the LLM can assist in providing information, guidelines, or references related to identifying diseases in animals or crops. The LLM can potentially help by providing general information on common diseases, symptoms, and diagnostic methods. It can also assist in suggesting possible solutions or treatments based on the information provided in the input. However, the task of physically examining animals or crop specimens to determine the presence of diseases involves hands-on skills and expertise that cannot be fully replaced by the LLM. While the LLM can provide some theoretical knowledge and guidance, the practical aspect of examining animals or crops requires physical presence and specialized training.
