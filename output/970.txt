1: In this task, an Animal Breeder is responsible for arranging the sale of animals and eggs to various establishments. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone or with additional software could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality.

- E1: Direct exposure - The task involves writing and transforming text to communicate with different establishments for the sale of animals and eggs. The LLM could assist in drafting emails, writing sales proposals, or summarizing information related to the sales process. This direct text-based assistance could streamline communication and documentation, potentially reducing the time needed to arrange sales.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not reduce the time by half for this task, additional software built on top of the LLM could enhance the process. For example, an application that retrieves market prices for animals and eggs, generates sales reports, or provides recommendations based on data analysis could further optimize the sales arrangements.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not directly relevant to this task as it primarily involves text-based communication for sales arrangements. Therefore, this task does not fall under E3.
