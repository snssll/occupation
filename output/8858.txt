1: In this task, a Postal Service Mail Sorter is responsible for loading and unloading mail trucks, which may involve lifting containers of mail onto equipment for sorting. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone or with additional software could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task.

- E0: This task involves physical labor, such as lifting containers of mail, which cannot be performed by the LLM or any software tool. Therefore, this task does not fit into the categories where LLM exposure would reduce the time significantly.

- E1: The task does not involve writing, transforming text, summarizing documents, or any other text-based activities that the LLM could directly assist with. The physical aspect of loading and unloading mail trucks is the primary focus of this task.

- E2: While it is conceivable that software could be developed to optimize mail sorting processes or provide recommendations based on data analysis, the core task of physically loading and unloading mail trucks would not be significantly impacted by LLM-powered applications alone.

- E3: The task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images, so the image capabilities of the LLM are not relevant here.
