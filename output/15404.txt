1: In this task, a detective or criminal investigator is required to secure a deceased body and obtain evidence from it while preventing bystanders from tampering with it before the medical examiner arrives. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it. 

- E0: This task involves physical actions such as securing a body and preventing tampering, which cannot be performed by the LLM or any software tools. Additionally, the task requires real-time decision-making and interaction with the physical environment, making it unsuitable for automation by the LLM.

- E1: The LLM could potentially assist in providing guidelines or protocols for securing a deceased body and preserving evidence. It could also help in drafting reports or documenting the situation. However, the core actions of physically securing the body and preventing tampering cannot be automated by the LLM.

- E2: While the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task, additional software could be developed to provide real-time guidance or instructions to detectives and investigators on how to secure a body effectively. This software could integrate with the LLM to generate tailored responses based on the specific situation.

- E3: The task does not involve image processing or analysis that would benefit from additional image capabilities. The core actions of securing a body and obtaining evidence do not require image-related assistance.

Based on the above analysis, the most appropriate exposure label for this task is E2.

2: E2

3: Moderate
