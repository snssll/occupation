1: In this task, a Chief Executive is required to represent organizations or promote their objectives at official functions, or delegate representatives to do so. This task involves communication, public relations, and strategic decision-making. While an LLM could potentially assist in drafting speeches or statements for the Chief Executive to deliver, it cannot physically attend official functions or interact with individuals in person. The task also involves a high degree of human interaction and decision-making that cannot be fully automated by the LLM. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not clearly decrease the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete the task with high quality by at least half.

2: E0

3: High
