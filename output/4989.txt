1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of developing or advising on social policy or assisting in community development as a Mental Health and Substance Abuse Social Worker, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be completed with the help of an LLM.

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** This task involves a significant amount of writing and transforming text to develop social policies or community development plans. An LLM can assist in researching and providing information on relevant policies, community needs, and best practices. The model can help in drafting reports, recommendations, and proposals based on the input provided. Therefore, direct access to the LLM can reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality by at least half.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While an LLM can assist in generating text and providing information, developing comprehensive social policies or community development plans may require specialized domain knowledge and expertise beyond what the LLM can provide. Additional software that integrates the LLM's capabilities with data analysis tools, policy databases, and community assessment tools could further streamline the process. This additional software could potentially reduce the time to complete the task by half.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Image capabilities are not relevant for this task as it primarily involves text-based work related to social policy development and community development.

Based on the above analysis, the task of developing or advising on social policy or assisting in community development as a Mental Health and Substance Abuse Social Worker is best classified as **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications)**.
