1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of maintaining a patient recall system as a Dental Hygienist, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be completed with the help of an LLM.

- Dental Hygienists are responsible for maintaining patient records, scheduling appointments, and ensuring patients return for regular check-ups. The task of maintaining a patient recall system involves keeping track of when patients are due for their next appointment and sending out reminders to encourage them to schedule a visit.

- With the help of an LLM, a Dental Hygienist could potentially automate the process of managing the patient recall system by generating personalized reminders based on the patient's history and preferences. The LLM could assist in drafting reminder messages, scheduling follow-up appointments, and even analyzing data to optimize the recall system.

- While the task involves some level of data management and communication, it may not require the complex capabilities of an LLM to complete efficiently. Basic software tools or databases tailored for dental practices could potentially handle the task effectively without the need for advanced language processing.
