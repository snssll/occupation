1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of setting mechanical traps or placing poisonous paste or bait in sewers, burrows, or ditches as a Pest Control Worker, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves physical actions such as setting traps and placing bait, which cannot be directly performed by the LLM. The LLM can provide information on pest control methods, safety precautions, types of traps, and bait selection, but it cannot physically execute the task. Therefore, this task does not fall under E1, E2, or E3 as it does not involve writing, transforming text, summarizing documents, or utilizing image capabilities.

2: E0

3: High
