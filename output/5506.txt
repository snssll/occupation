1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of directing or coordinating bakery deliveries for bakers, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be impacted by the use of the LLM. 

- Direct exposure (E1): The task of coordinating bakery deliveries involves organizing and managing the logistics of delivering baked goods to various locations. With direct access to the LLM, a worker could potentially use the model to draft delivery schedules, communicate with delivery personnel, or even generate reports on delivery performance. The LLM could assist in creating detailed instructions or messages related to the deliveries, optimizing routes, or providing reminders for upcoming deliveries. Overall, the LLM could significantly reduce the time it takes to organize and manage bakery deliveries efficiently.

- Exposure by LLM-powered applications (E2): While the LLM alone can streamline some aspects of coordinating bakery deliveries, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to further enhance this process. For example, an application could be created that integrates real-time traffic data to suggest the most efficient delivery routes, or a system that automatically updates delivery schedules based on changing factors. These enhancements could further improve the efficiency and accuracy of coordinating bakery deliveries.

- Exposure given image capabilities (E3): The task of coordinating bakery deliveries does not directly involve image processing or analysis, so the image capabilities of the LLM would not significantly impact this specific task.

Based on the above analysis, the task of directing or coordinating bakery deliveries would likely fall under E2 - Exposure by LLM-powered applications.
