1: In this task, a Mechanical Engineering Technologist or Technician is required to record test procedures, results, numerical and graphical data, and recommendations for changes in product or test methods. To complete this task, the individual needs to document information accurately and clearly. With the help of the LLM, the technician could potentially streamline the process of recording this information by generating detailed reports based on the input data. The LLM could assist in summarizing the test procedures, results, and recommendations, as well as organizing the numerical and graphical data in a coherent manner. Additionally, the LLM could help in generating standardized templates for recording this information, making the process more efficient.
