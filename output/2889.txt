1: In this task for Urban and Regional Planners, the main activities involve conducting field investigations, surveys, impact studies, and research to compile and analyze data on various factors affecting land use. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- Conducting field investigations and surveys: The LLM could potentially assist in generating survey questions or analyzing survey data, but the actual fieldwork would still require human involvement.
- Compiling and analyzing data: The LLM could help in data analysis by providing insights or generating reports based on the compiled data.
- Research on economic, social, regulatory, or physical factors: The LLM could assist in gathering information, summarizing research findings, or even generating reports based on the research conducted.

Considering the task involves a mix of data collection, analysis, and research, the LLM could significantly reduce the time required for tasks like data analysis, report generation, and possibly even research assistance. However, the fieldwork aspect would still require human involvement, limiting the extent of time saved.
