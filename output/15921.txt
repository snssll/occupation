1: In this task, a Grinding and Polishing Worker, Hand is required to sharpen abrasive grinding tools using machines and hand tools. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves a physical action of sharpening tools using machines and hand tools, which cannot be directly performed by an LLM. The LLM does not have the capability to physically manipulate tools or machinery. Therefore, this task falls under the category of manual labor that requires hands-on work and cannot be automated by the LLM. As a result, the task does not benefit from the capabilities of the LLM, and no exposure label applies.
