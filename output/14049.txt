1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of recording details of calls, dispatches, and messages for Public Safety Telecommunicators, we need to consider the nature of the task and how LLM could assist in completing it.

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** The task involves writing and transforming text based on specific information provided during emergency calls. The LLM could assist in transcribing and organizing these details accurately and efficiently, reducing the time needed to document the information. The model can help in summarizing the information, ensuring accuracy, and maintaining records of the data.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the LLM alone can aid in transcribing and organizing information, additional software could be developed to integrate with the LLM for specific features like real-time transcription, automated data entry, or voice recognition to further streamline the process. Such software could enhance the capabilities of the LLM for this task.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Image capabilities are not directly relevant to the task of recording details of calls, dispatches, and messages for Public Safety Telecommunicators. This task primarily involves text-based information and does not require image processing.
