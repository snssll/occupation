1: In this task, an Advertising and Promotions Manager needs to contact organizations to explain the services and facilities offered. To complete this task, the manager would typically need to draft emails or make phone calls to convey this information effectively. With access to the LLM, the manager could potentially use the model to draft email templates, refine communication strategies, or even generate scripts for phone calls. The LLM could assist in crafting persuasive and informative messages tailored to different organizations. However, the task also involves human interaction and negotiation, which may not be fully automated by the LLM. While the LLM can help with the initial communication, the actual negotiation and discussion may still require human intervention. Therefore, this task falls under E1 as the LLM can significantly reduce the time needed to draft initial communication but may not fully automate the entire process.
