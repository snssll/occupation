1: In this task, the Biomass Plant Technicians are required to operate equipment to start, stop, or regulate biomass-fueled generators, generator units, boilers, engines, or auxiliary systems. This task involves hands-on technical skills and knowledge of biomass plant operations. The task does not involve text input or output, and the context is more focused on practical operations rather than information processing. As such, the task does not align with the capabilities of the LLM, which is more suited for text-based tasks such as writing, summarizing, or providing information. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not benefit from the capabilities of the LLM.
