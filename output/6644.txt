1: In this task, a Title Examiner needs to examine individual titles to determine if there are any restrictions, such as delinquent taxes, that could affect the titles and limit property use. To complete this task, the Title Examiner would typically need to review legal documents, property records, and potentially communicate with relevant parties to gather information. The task involves analyzing complex legal information and making judgments based on the findings.

Given the nature of the task, an LLM could potentially assist by providing information on common restrictions related to property titles, legal terminology explanations, or even sample templates for title examination reports. The LLM could also help in generating initial drafts of reports based on the data provided. However, the task also requires a deep understanding of legal concepts and the ability to interpret nuanced information, which may go beyond the capabilities of the LLM.

Considering these factors, I would classify this task as E2 - Exposure by LLM-powered applications. While the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task, additional software built on top of the LLM could potentially streamline the process by providing relevant legal information and aiding in report generation.
