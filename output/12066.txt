1: In this task, a career counselor is responsible for planning, directing, and participating in recruitment and enrollment activities. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality. The task involves strategic planning, coordination, and communication skills, which may not be directly aided by the LLM's text generation capabilities. While the LLM could potentially assist in drafting communication materials or providing information on recruitment strategies, the core aspects of recruitment and enrollment activities involve human interaction, decision-making, and coordination that may not be significantly expedited by the LLM alone.
