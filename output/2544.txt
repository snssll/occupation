1: In this task, a Speech-Language Pathologist is required to communicate with students who use alternative methods of communication, such as sign language or computer technology. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- Direct exposure (E1): The task involves communication with students using alternative methods, which may require understanding and generating text-based communication. The LLM could assist in providing guidance on effective communication strategies, generating sample messages, or even translating text into sign language. This could significantly reduce the time needed to prepare for and engage in these communications.

- Exposure by LLM-powered applications (E2): While the LLM alone may not reduce the time it takes to complete the task by half, additional software built on top of the LLM could enhance the process. For example, a specialized tool could be developed to analyze the effectiveness of communication methods, provide recommendations based on student responses, or even offer real-time translation services for sign language.

- Exposure given image capabilities (E3): Image capabilities are not directly relevant to this task as it primarily involves text-based communication through sign language or computer technology. Therefore, this task does not fall under E3.

Considering the above points, the task of communicating with students who use alternative methods of communication is best categorized as E1 - Direct exposure.

2: E1
