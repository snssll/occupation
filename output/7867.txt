1: In this task, an Occupational Health and Safety Technician is required to inspect fire suppression systems or portable fire systems to ensure they are in proper working order. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be significantly aided by the use of the language model. The task involves physical inspection and testing of equipment, which cannot be directly assisted by an LLM. While the technician may need to refer to manuals or guidelines for specific procedures, the actual inspection and testing require hands-on work and technical knowledge that the LLM cannot provide. Therefore, the task does not fall under E1, E2, or E3 exposure levels as the LLM cannot directly assist in completing the task.

2: E0
