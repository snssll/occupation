1: In this task, the Stationary Engineers and Boiler Operators are responsible for firing coal furnaces and operating gas- or oil-fed boilers. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone or with additional software could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality.

- E0: This task involves physical labor and manual operation of machinery, which cannot be replaced by text-based tools like the LLM. The task requires hands-on work and direct interaction with equipment, making it unsuitable for automation through the LLM.
- E1: The task of firing coal furnaces and operating boilers involves practical skills and real-time adjustments that cannot be effectively replicated by text-based tools alone. The physical nature of the task and the need for hands-on operation make it unlikely that the LLM can reduce the time to complete the task by at least half.
- E2: While it is conceivable that software could be developed to provide guidance or instructions related to boiler operation, the complexity and real-time adjustments required in this task make it challenging to automate significantly with the current capabilities of the LLM alone.
- E3: The task does not involve image processing or detailed visual analysis that would benefit from additional image capabilities. The nature of the task is more focused on physical operation rather than visual or image-related tasks.

Based on the considerations above, the most appropriate label for this task is E0.

2: E0

3: High
