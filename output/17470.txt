1: In this task, a hairdresser, hairstylist, or cosmetologist is required to update and maintain customer information records related to beauty services provided. With the help of the LLM, the task can be completed more efficiently by generating text for updating customer records, organizing the information, and ensuring accuracy in maintaining the records. The LLM can assist in summarizing customer details, suggesting relevant information to include, and even providing templates for record-keeping. However, since this task primarily involves data entry and organization of customer information, it does not significantly benefit from the advanced capabilities of the LLM such as complex decision-making or specialized domain knowledge retrieval. Therefore, this task falls under E1 as the LLM can streamline the process of updating and maintaining customer information records, but additional software development beyond the LLM may not provide substantial further efficiency gains.
