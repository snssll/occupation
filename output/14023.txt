1: For the task of recording and reporting demonstration-related information, such as the number of questions asked by the audience or the number of coupons distributed, the use of an LLM could potentially reduce the time it takes to complete the task. The LLM could assist in generating templates for recording information, summarizing data, or even providing suggestions on how to effectively report the information gathered. However, since this task primarily involves manual data collection and reporting, the LLM's direct impact may not be significant in reducing the time needed to complete the task by at least half. It is possible to imagine additional software that could be developed on top of the LLM to automate data collection and reporting processes, but such a tool would need to be specifically tailored to this task to achieve a significant time reduction.
