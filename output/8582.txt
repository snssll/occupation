1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of investigating work-related complaints as a First-Line Supervisor of Landscaping, Lawn Service, and Groundskeeping Workers, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be supported by the capabilities of the LLM. 

- The task involves investigating work-related complaints, which primarily requires understanding the nature of the complaints, verifying the problems, and determining appropriate responses. This task is heavily reliant on human judgment, empathy, and interpersonal skills, which are not directly supported by the LLM.
- While the LLM can assist in generating written responses or providing information on general procedures for handling complaints, the core aspect of investigating complaints involves interacting with employees, assessing the validity of claims, and making nuanced decisions based on the specific context of the complaint.
- The LLM does not have the ability to directly observe workplace dynamics, assess non-verbal cues, or engage in real-time dialogue to gather additional information. These limitations make it challenging for the LLM to significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with high quality.

Based on these considerations, the task of investigating work-related complaints as a First-Line Supervisor of Landscaping, Lawn Service, and Groundskeeping Workers is best classified as E0 - No exposure.
