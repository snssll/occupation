1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of preparing, administering, and grading tests and assignments to evaluate students' progress for the occupation of teachers, we need to consider the nature of the task. This task involves a significant amount of writing and transforming text, as teachers need to create test questions, assignments, and grading rubrics. The task also involves providing feedback on students' work, which can be done through written comments. Additionally, the task may involve generating questions for assessments. Since the task primarily revolves around written communication and assessment, it is likely that direct access to the LLM could reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality by at least half. Therefore, this task falls under the label E1.
