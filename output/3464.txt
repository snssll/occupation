1: In this task, a Merchandise Displayer and Window Trimmer is required to consult with advertising or sales staff to determine the type of merchandise to be featured and the time and place for each display. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. This task involves communication, decision-making, and coordination with other staff members to plan merchandise displays effectively. While the LLM can provide information and generate text, it cannot physically set up displays or interact with staff in person. The task does not involve complex data analysis, specialized domain knowledge, or image processing that would significantly benefit from the LLM's capabilities. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not clearly decrease the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete the task with high quality by at least half.
