1: In this task, a Probation Officer or Correctional Treatment Specialist is responsible for preparing and maintaining a case folder for each assigned inmate or offender. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we can break down the task as follows:

- **Preparing a case folder**: This involves organizing information about the inmate or offender, including personal details, criminal history, progress reports, and any other relevant information.
- **Maintaining the case folder**: This includes updating the folder with new information, documenting interactions, tracking progress, and ensuring all necessary information is up to date.

Given that this task involves primarily writing and organizing text-based information, it can be effectively completed using the capabilities of the LLM. The LLM can assist in drafting reports, summarizing information, organizing data, and maintaining records efficiently.
