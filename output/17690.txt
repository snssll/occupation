1: In this task, a Roustabout in the Oil and Gas industry is required to walk flow lines to locate leaks, using electronic detectors and visual inspections, and then repair the leaks. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves physical movement (walking), visual inspections, and manual repair work. While the task description does not explicitly mention the need for extensive written or text-based activities, it is clear that the primary actions involve physical tasks that cannot be directly replaced by an LLM. The LLM cannot physically walk flow lines, use electronic detectors, or physically repair leaks. Therefore, the task does not fall under E1, E2, or E3 exposure categories as the LLM alone cannot significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with high quality.

2: E0

3: High
