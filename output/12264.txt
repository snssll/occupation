1: In this task, a welder is required to prepare material surfaces to be welded by ensuring they are free of any contaminants like loose scale, slag, rust, moisture, grease, or other foreign matter. To determine the exposure level, we need to consider if the task can be significantly aided by the use of an LLM. Since this task involves physical preparation of materials and does not primarily rely on text-based information or decision-making, it is unlikely that an LLM would provide a substantial benefit in completing this task more efficiently.
