1: In this task of sending out notices and accepting fine payments for lost or overdue books, the main activities involve communication with library patrons regarding their overdue books and handling financial transactions for fine payments. These activities primarily require written communication skills and basic financial transaction processing. 

Considering the exposure rubric:
- E1: Direct access to the LLM could potentially reduce the time it takes to draft notices to patrons and responses to their inquiries. The model could also assist in drafting templates for fine payment receipts. However, the financial transaction processing aspect may not be significantly impacted by the LLM.
- E2: While additional software could potentially be developed to automate the process of sending out notices based on predefined templates and handling fine payments through an integrated system, the current capabilities of the LLM alone may not provide a substantial advantage in completing this task.
- E3: Image capabilities are not relevant for this task as it primarily involves written communication and financial transactions.

2: E2

3: Moderate
