1: In this task, a Meter Reader in Utilities is required to perform preventative maintenance or minor repairs on meters. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

Performing preventative maintenance or minor repairs on meters involves practical, hands-on work that requires physical interaction with the meters. This task is not solely based on text input and output but involves manual dexterity, technical skills, and potentially specialized knowledge about meters and utilities. The task does not primarily involve writing, summarizing, analyzing text, or making decisions based on information processed by an LLM. Therefore, the task does not align with the capabilities of an LLM or any software built on top of it. As a result, this task falls under E0 as it does not benefit from exposure to an LLM.
