1: For the task of directing theatre productions and projects as a Communications Teacher in a postsecondary setting, the most relevant exposure label from the rubric would be E0. This task involves hands-on work that requires physical presence, interaction with actors and crew, and the ability to make real-time decisions during rehearsals and performances. While an LLM could potentially assist with providing theoretical knowledge, guidance on communication strategies, or script analysis, it cannot replace the practical skills and experience needed to direct a live theatre production effectively.

2: E0
