1: In this task, an Amusement and Recreation Attendant is responsible for verifying, collecting, or punching tickets before admitting patrons to venues like amusement parks and rides. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. This task involves a straightforward and repetitive action of checking tickets, which does not require complex decision-making or specialized knowledge beyond the scope of the task itself. The task primarily involves following a set procedure and does not involve in-depth analysis, creativity, or complex interactions. Given that the task is routine and does not require advanced cognitive abilities, it is unlikely that access to an LLM would significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as the use of an LLM would not provide a substantial time-saving benefit for an experienced worker performing this task.
