1: In this task, a teaching assistant in a postsecondary setting is required to meet with supervisors to discuss students' grades or complete grade-related paperwork. With access to the most powerful OpenAI large language model (LLM), the assistant could potentially use the model to draft reports, summaries, or emails related to student grades. The LLM could assist in generating meeting agendas, drafting emails to supervisors, or even providing suggestions on how to approach grade-related discussions. However, since the task involves direct interaction with supervisors and potentially sensitive student information, the LLM's role would be limited to providing support in preparing written materials rather than directly engaging in the discussion or decision-making process. Therefore, the task could be classified as E1, as the LLM could significantly reduce the time needed to prepare written materials for grade-related discussions.
