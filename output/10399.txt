1: In this task, the worker is required to notify other workers of defects in the extruding and forming machines and direct them to make adjustments. To complete this task, the worker needs to have a good understanding of the machines, the production process, and the adjustments needed to rectify defects. The task involves communication, problem-solving, and technical knowledge related to machine operations. While the LLM can provide information on machine operations and potential adjustments, it may not have real-time data on the specific defects occurring in the machines unless that information is provided in the input. The LLM can assist in generating instructions for adjusting the machines based on general knowledge. However, the task also requires real-time observation and interaction with the machines and other workers, which the LLM cannot directly facilitate. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it involves real-time decision-making and physical interaction that cannot be significantly aided by the LLM.
