1: Telemarketers are responsible for making sales calls to potential customers. One of their tasks is to adjust sales scripts to better target the needs and interests of specific individuals. To determine the appropriate label for this task's exposure to LLM, we can break it down:

- Writing and transforming text: The task involves adjusting sales scripts, which requires writing and transforming text to tailor it to specific individuals.
- Providing edits to existing text: Telemarketers may need to edit existing sales scripts to better target specific needs and interests.
- Providing feedback on documents: Telemarketers may benefit from receiving feedback on the effectiveness of their adjusted sales scripts.
- Writing and responding to emails: While the task does not explicitly involve emails, the communication aspect is similar, as telemarketers need to communicate effectively through their adjusted sales scripts.

Considering these points, the task of adjusting sales scripts for telemarketers aligns closely with the capabilities of an LLM, as it involves text transformation, editing, feedback provision, and communication. Therefore, this task falls under label E1.
