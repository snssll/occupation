1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of applying principles of specialized fields of science to achieve conservation objectives as a Conservation Scientist, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be supported by the capabilities of the LLM.

- The task involves applying principles from specialized fields of science like agronomy, soil science, forestry, or agriculture to achieve conservation objectives. This task requires a deep understanding of scientific principles and their practical application in the context of conservation.

- The LLM can provide general information on these specialized fields of science, but it may not have access to the most up-to-date or specific information required for conservation work, especially if it involves recent developments or field-specific knowledge.

- While the LLM can assist in summarizing existing information or providing general insights, the task of applying these principles to achieve conservation objectives likely requires hands-on experience, fieldwork, and specialized knowledge that may not be effectively supported by the LLM alone.
