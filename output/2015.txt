1: In this task, a Food and Tobacco Roasting, Baking, and Drying Machine Operator and Tender is responsible for cleaning equipment using steam, hot water, and hoses. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if the task can be significantly expedited or improved by using the LLM. Since this task involves physical actions such as operating machinery and using cleaning equipment, it does not directly involve text-based or information processing that the LLM excels at. The task does not involve complex decision-making, analysis, or information retrieval that would benefit from the LLM's capabilities. Therefore, this task does not align with any of the exposure labels provided.

2: E0
