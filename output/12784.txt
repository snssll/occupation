1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of preparing sketches, floor plans, or models of proposed displays for Merchandise Displayers and Window Trimmers, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves creating visual representations based on specific requirements, which may not be directly achievable through text input and output alone. While the LLM can assist in generating text-based descriptions or providing creative ideas, it may not have the ability to directly create sketches, floor plans, or models without additional image capabilities. Therefore, this task falls under E3 exposure given image capabilities, as having access to both the LLM and a system that can create images would significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task.
