1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of evaluating business operations to identify risk areas for fraud as a Fraud Examiner, Investigator, or Analyst, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The task involves analyzing text-based information related to business operations and fraud risk. The LLM can assist in providing insights, generating reports, and identifying potential areas of concern based on the input data. The LLM can help in summarizing relevant documents, providing feedback on potential risk factors, and generating questions to further investigate fraud possibilities within the business operations.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM can assist in analyzing text-based information, it may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task by half on its own. However, with additional software developed on top of the LLM, such as tools for searching and retrieving up-to-date information on fraud trends, industry best practices, and case studies, the efficiency of identifying risk areas for fraud could be improved.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not directly relevant to the task of evaluating business operations for fraud risk. This task primarily involves analyzing text-based information and does not require image processing capabilities.
