1: In this task, a surveyor is required to locate and mark sites selected for geophysical prospecting activities. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes for a surveyor to complete this task with high quality. The task involves physical work in the field, such as locating and marking sites, which cannot be directly assisted by the LLM. The expertise required for this task includes knowledge of geophysical prospecting techniques, understanding of surveying equipment, and physical ability to work outdoors. Since the task involves physical actions and specialized field knowledge, it is unlikely that the LLM can provide a significant time-saving benefit in completing this task.
