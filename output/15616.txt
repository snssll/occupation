1: In this task, a retail salesperson is responsible for selling merchandise and arranging additional services such as delivery, insurance, financing, or service contracts. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task and how an LLM could potentially assist in completing it more efficiently. 

- E0: This task involves direct human interaction and decision-making, such as negotiating with customers and arranging services, which cannot be fully automated by an LLM. The task also requires physical actions like arranging delivery, which are outside the capabilities of the LLM.
- E1: While an LLM could potentially assist in providing information about merchandise, insurance options, or financing terms to the salesperson, the core aspects of selling, negotiating, and arranging services require human judgment and interaction. The LLM may help in generating written materials or responses, but it cannot replace the essential human elements of the task.
- E2: It is conceivable that additional software built on top of an LLM could assist in summarizing customer preferences, analyzing financing options, or generating sales scripts based on customer data. However, the complexity of human interaction and decision-making involved in selling and arranging services may still require significant human input.
- E3: The task does not involve image processing or detailed visual information that would benefit from additional image capabilities alongside the LLM.
