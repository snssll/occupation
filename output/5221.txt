1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of developing training materials and procedures or training users in the proper use of hardware or software as a Computer User Support Specialist, we need to consider the capabilities of the OpenAI large language model (LLM).

- Developing training materials and procedures involves writing and organizing information in a structured and understandable way. The LLM can assist in generating written content, providing explanations, and creating instructional materials.
- Training users in the proper use of hardware or software may involve creating step-by-step guides, FAQs, or interactive tutorials. The LLM can help in generating these materials, answering common user queries, and providing detailed explanations.

Given that the task involves writing and transforming text to create training materials and procedures, the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality. Therefore, this task falls under the category of E1 - Direct exposure.
