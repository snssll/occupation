1: In this task, an art therapist is required to observe and document client reactions, progress, or other outcomes related to art therapy. With the help of a large language model (LLM), the therapist could potentially use the LLM to assist in documenting these observations and outcomes. The LLM could help in summarizing the observations, organizing the data, and potentially even providing insights or suggestions based on the documented information. This task involves writing and transforming text according to specific instructions, which is a capability that the LLM can provide. Therefore, this task falls under the E1 category as the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality.
