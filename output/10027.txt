1: In this task, a Chemical Equipment Operator and Tender is required to monitor gauges, recording instruments, flowmeters, or products to ensure specified conditions are maintained. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves monitoring equipment and recording data, which can be done through text input and output. The task does not involve complex decision-making, precise measurements, or detailed visuals. Therefore, it is possible that an LLM could assist in providing guidance on how to monitor the equipment or record data effectively. The LLM could potentially generate checklists, reminders, or troubleshooting tips based on general knowledge in the field of chemical equipment operation. However, since the task does not involve specialized domain knowledge or complex databases, the assistance provided by the LLM may not significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete the task. Therefore, this task falls under E2 - Exposure by LLM-powered applications, as additional software could potentially be developed to enhance the efficiency of completing the task.
