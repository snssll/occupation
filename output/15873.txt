1: In this task, the occupation involves setting up, operating, or tending saws or machines to cut or trim wood to specified dimensions. This task is very hands-on and requires physical interaction with machinery and wood materials. The task does not involve writing, transforming text, providing edits, summarizing documents, or any other text-based activities that an LLM could directly assist with. Additionally, this task requires precise measurements and physical manipulation of materials, which cannot be done by an LLM. Therefore, the task does not align with any of the exposure levels in the rubric.
