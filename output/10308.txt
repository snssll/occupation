1: In this task, the main activity involves physically moving materials, supplies, components, and finished products between storage and work areas. This task is hands-on and requires physical interaction with the items being moved. Since the task involves manual labor and does not primarily rely on text-based information processing, it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM. The LLM cannot physically move objects or interact with the physical environment. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not benefit from the use of the LLM or any tools built on top of it.

2: E0
