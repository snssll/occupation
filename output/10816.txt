1: In this task, the Paving, Surfacing, and Tamping Equipment Operators operate machines to clean or cut expansion joints in concrete or asphalt and rout out cracks in pavement. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if the task can be significantly expedited or improved by using the LLM. Since this task involves physical operation of machinery and requires hands-on work with concrete and asphalt surfaces, it does not seem like the LLM or any LLM-powered tool could directly assist in completing the task. The task is practical and manual in nature, focusing on operating heavy equipment and performing physical tasks that cannot be replaced by text-based or image-based processing. Therefore, the task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM.
