1: In this task, a Court Reporter or Simultaneous Captioner transcribes recorded proceedings according to specific formats. With the help of a powerful OpenAI large language model (LLM), the transcription process can be significantly expedited. The LLM can accurately transcribe spoken words into text, ensuring that the content is captured with high accuracy. The model can also assist in formatting the transcribed text as per the required guidelines, saving time that would otherwise be spent on manual formatting. Additionally, the LLM can help in identifying and correcting errors in the transcription, further streamlining the process. Overall, the LLM can enhance the efficiency and accuracy of transcribing recorded proceedings, making it a suitable candidate for exposure to LLM.
