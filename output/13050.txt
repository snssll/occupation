1: In this task of procuring parts and maintaining inventory and related documentation as an Electrical and Electronic Engineering Technologist or Technician, the exposure to LLM can be evaluated as follows:

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** The task involves a significant amount of written documentation and record-keeping, which can be efficiently handled by the LLM. The model can assist in generating inventory reports, tracking parts procurement, and maintaining related documentation. It can also help in writing emails for ordering parts or updating inventory records. Therefore, direct access to the LLM can reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality by at least half.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the LLM alone can handle the text-based aspects of this task effectively, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to automate inventory tracking, generate procurement recommendations based on historical data, or integrate with existing inventory management systems. Such software could further streamline the process and reduce the time required to complete the task.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Image capabilities are not directly relevant to the task of procuring parts and maintaining inventory and related documentation in this context. The task primarily involves text-based activities, and image capabilities would not significantly impact the completion time or quality of the task.
