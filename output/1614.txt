1: In this task, a Loan Officer is required to calculate the amount of debt and funds available to plan methods of payoff and estimate the time for debt liquidation. This task involves numerical calculations and financial analysis. While the LLM can assist with providing general information on financial concepts and calculations, it may not have the specific domain knowledge required to accurately calculate the amount of debt, funds available, and estimate the time for debt liquidation in a real-world scenario. The task also involves making financial decisions based on the calculated information, which may require human judgment and expertise. Therefore, the task does not seem to fit into any of the exposure categories (E1, E2, E3) as the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced Loan Officer to complete the task with high quality.
