1: In this task, a nurse midwife is required to educate patients and family members on various aspects of care related to pregnancy, childbirth, and postpartum care. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves providing information and education to patients and family members, which can be effectively done through written or spoken communication.
- The task does not involve complex data analysis, specialized domain knowledge retrieval, or detailed image processing.
- The information provided to patients and family members is based on established medical guidelines and practices, which may not require real-time up-to-date information retrieval.
- The task primarily involves communication and education, which can be facilitated by the LLM in generating educational materials, answering questions, or providing explanations.

Based on these considerations, the task of educating patients and family members as a nurse midwife could benefit from the capabilities of the LLM in generating educational content, answering questions, and providing explanations, which would significantly reduce the time required to prepare educational materials and communicate effectively.
