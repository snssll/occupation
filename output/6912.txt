1: In this task, the Furnace, Kiln, Oven, Drier, and Kettle Operator and Tender is responsible for feeding fuel into fireboxes or conveyors and removing ashes from furnaces using shovels and buckets. This task involves manual labor and physical interaction with machinery, making it unsuitable for automation using an LLM. The task requires hands-on work, precise movements, and potentially dangerous conditions, which cannot be replicated by an LLM. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM or any tools built on top of it.
