1: In this task, a Loan Officer is required to confer with underwriters to resolve mortgage application problems. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could assist in completing it. 

- E0: This task involves direct communication and collaboration between the Loan Officer and underwriters. The task requires human interaction, understanding of complex financial information, and decision-making based on specific circumstances. The LLM, even with its capabilities, cannot replace the need for direct communication and collaboration in this context.

- E1: While the LLM could potentially assist in providing general information about mortgage application processes, terms, or common issues, it cannot directly confer with underwriters or resolve specific application problems. The task involves real-time communication, negotiation, and decision-making that are beyond the capabilities of the LLM to handle independently.

- E2: It is conceivable that additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to assist Loan Officers in analyzing mortgage application data, providing recommendations based on historical data, or even generating reports. However, the core task of conferring with underwriters to resolve specific problems still heavily relies on human judgment, experience, and communication skills.

- E3: The task does not involve image processing or detailed visual information that would require additional capabilities beyond text-based processing. Therefore, exposure to image capabilities would not significantly impact the completion of this task.
