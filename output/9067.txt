1: In this task, a cashier is responsible for maintaining clean and orderly checkout areas, as well as completing general cleaning duties like mopping floors and emptying trash cans. To determine the exposure level, we need to consider if the task can be significantly reduced in time with the help of an LLM. 

- The task involves physical actions such as mopping floors and emptying trash cans, which cannot be directly assisted by an LLM.
- While the task involves written instructions (maintaining clean and orderly checkout areas), the actual execution requires physical presence and actions.
- The task does not involve complex decision-making, analysis, or specialized knowledge that would benefit significantly from an LLM's capabilities.

Based on these considerations, it is clear that the task of maintaining clean and orderly checkout areas and completing general cleaning duties is not something that can be significantly expedited or improved by an LLM. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not meet the criteria for exposure to LLM capabilities.
