1: In this task, a Regulatory Affairs Manager is responsible for reviewing all regulatory agency submission materials to ensure they are timely, accurate, comprehensive, and compliant with regulatory standards. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves reviewing text-based documents, which can be effectively handled by the LLM in terms of understanding and analyzing the content.
- The LLM can assist in identifying any discrepancies, errors, or areas of improvement in the regulatory agency submission materials.
- The LLM can provide suggestions, feedback, and even generate reports based on the analysis of the regulatory documents.
- While the task may require some domain-specific knowledge related to regulatory standards, the LLM can still aid in the review process by highlighting potential issues or areas that need attention.

Based on these considerations, the task can be significantly expedited and enhanced in quality by utilizing the LLM for document review and analysis, making it suitable for an E1 label.
