1: In this task, a Bookkeeping, Accounting, and Auditing Clerk is required to perform general office duties such as filing, answering telephones, and handling routine correspondence. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- E0: This task involves physical actions like filing and answering telephones, which cannot be directly assisted by an LLM or any software tool. The task also requires human interaction, making it unsuitable for automation using LLM technology.
- E1: While an LLM could potentially assist in drafting routine correspondence or providing suggestions for responses to common queries, the physical aspects of the task, such as filing and answering telephones, cannot be directly automated by the LLM alone.
- E2: With additional software development, it is conceivable that an application could be created to automate some aspects of routine correspondence handling or provide templates for responses. However, the physical office duties like filing and answering telephones would still require human intervention.
- E3: The task does not involve image processing or detailed visual instructions, so exposure to image capabilities would not significantly impact the completion of the task.

Based on the analysis, the most appropriate label for this task is E2.

2: E2

3: Moderate
