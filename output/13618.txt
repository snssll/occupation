1: In this task, the operating engineer is required to push other equipment when extra traction or assistance is needed. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. This task involves physical interaction with equipment, requiring manual labor and physical strength to push the equipment. Since the task involves physical actions and does not primarily rely on written or spoken communication, it is unlikely that the LLM or any tools built on top of it could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task. The task also does not involve complex decision-making, analysis of data, or specialized knowledge that the LLM could assist with. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM or any tools built on top of it.
