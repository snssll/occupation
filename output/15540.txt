1: In this task, a Fitness and Wellness Coordinator is responsible for selecting or supervising contractors such as event hosts or health, fitness, and wellness practitioners. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if the task can be significantly expedited or enhanced by using the LLM. 

- The task involves decision-making based on specific criteria and qualifications of contractors. The LLM could potentially assist in providing information on best practices for selecting contractors or guidelines for supervising them.
- The LLM could help in generating interview questions for potential contractors or drafting emails to communicate with them.
- It could also aid in summarizing information about different contractors or providing insights into industry trends that could impact contractor selection.

Considering these points, the task could benefit from the LLM's capabilities in providing information, generating text, and assisting in decision-making related to contractor selection and supervision. Therefore, this task falls under label E1 as the LLM can reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality by at least half.
