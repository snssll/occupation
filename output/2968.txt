1: In this task, an Ophthalmic Medical Technologist or Technician conducts ocular motility tests to measure the function of eye muscles. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- Ocular motility tests involve assessing the movement and coordination of the eye muscles, which is a hands-on and practical procedure.
- The task requires physical interaction with the patient to conduct the tests accurately.
- The assessment involves observing the patient's eye movements and responses in real-time, which cannot be fully captured through text input alone.
- The task does not involve extensive written or spoken communication that could be easily automated by an LLM.

Based on these considerations, it is evident that the task of conducting ocular motility tests is highly reliant on physical interaction and real-time observation, making it unsuitable for automation or assistance by an LLM.
