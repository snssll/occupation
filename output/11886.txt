1: For the task of planning and developing audio-visual devices for public programs as a Park Naturalist, the exposure to LLM can be evaluated as follows:

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** The task involves creating audio-visual devices, which may require writing scripts, designing visuals, and planning the overall content. An LLM could assist in generating scripts, providing ideas for visuals, and helping with the overall planning process. The LLM can be used to brainstorm ideas, draft content, and refine the messaging for the audio-visual devices.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the LLM can assist in generating content and ideas, there may be additional software that could be developed on top of the LLM to streamline the process further. This software could potentially automate the creation of visuals based on the content provided, suggest interactive elements for the devices, or even help in testing the effectiveness of the audio-visual devices with target audiences.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Image capabilities may not significantly impact the task of planning and developing audio-visual devices, as the focus is more on the content and messaging rather than detailed visual elements. The LLM's text capabilities are more relevant in this context.
