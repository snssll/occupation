1: In this task of verifying proper packaging and labeling of exported goods, the main activities involve checking the packaging to ensure it meets export regulations, confirming that the goods are labeled correctly with necessary information such as destination, weight, and handling instructions, and ensuring that the packaging is secure for transportation. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if the task can be significantly expedited or improved by using the LLM. 

- E0: This task does not involve complex decision-making that requires human judgment or interaction. It primarily involves visual inspection and verification of packaging and labeling, which may not benefit significantly from the use of an LLM or LLM-powered tools. The task does not involve detailed measurements or specialized domain knowledge that the LLM could provide.

- E1: While the LLM could potentially assist in providing general guidelines on proper packaging and labeling practices, the task itself is more practical and hands-on, requiring physical inspection and verification. The LLM may not be able to directly verify the physical aspects of packaging and labeling.

- E2: It is conceivable that an application could be developed on top of the LLM that could assist in summarizing export regulations related to packaging and labeling, providing quick access to relevant information. However, the core task of physically verifying the packaging and labeling would still require manual inspection.

- E3: The task does not involve image processing or detailed visual analysis that would benefit significantly from image capabilities. The verification of packaging and labeling is more text-based and practical in nature.
