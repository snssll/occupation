1: In this task, a Low Vision Therapist, Orientation and Mobility Specialist, or Vision Rehabilitation Therapist is required to provide consultation, support, or education to groups such as parents and teachers. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- Direct exposure (E1): The task involves providing consultation, support, or education through written or spoken communication. An LLM could assist in generating educational materials, drafting consultation reports, or even providing responses to common questions from parents and teachers. The LLM could help in summarizing information, generating FAQs, or drafting emails for communication purposes.

- Exposure by LLM-powered applications (E2): While an LLM could potentially assist in generating written materials or responses, it may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task by half. However, with additional software developed on top of the LLM, such as a tool that can summarize educational content or provide tailored recommendations for consultation, the task could be completed more efficiently.

- Exposure given image capabilities (E3): Image capabilities are not directly relevant to the task of providing consultation, support, or education to groups through written or spoken communication. Therefore, this task does not fall under E3.

Considering the above analysis, the task of providing consultation, support, or education to groups such as parents and teachers aligns best with Exposure by LLM-powered applications (E2).
