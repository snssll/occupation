1: In this task, the occupation involves marking weld points and positions of components on workpieces. This task primarily requires physical interaction with the workpieces and tools such as rules, squares, templates, or scribes. The task does not involve text input or output that can be effectively processed by an LLM. The LLM does not have the capability to physically interact with workpieces or tools to mark weld points. Therefore, the task does not align with the capabilities of the LLM or any tools built on top of it. As a result, this task falls under E0 as it does not benefit from exposure to the LLM.

2: E0
