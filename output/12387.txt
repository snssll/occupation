1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of preparing and submitting detailed and summary reports of post office activities to designated supervisors as a Postmaster or Mail Superintendent, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it. 

- The task involves writing detailed and summary reports based on post office activities, which can be effectively completed by an LLM through text generation capabilities.
- The LLM can assist in summarizing the data and information collected from post office activities, helping to streamline the report preparation process.
- The LLM can also help in organizing the information in a coherent and structured manner, ensuring that the reports are well-composed and informative.

Based on these considerations, the task can be significantly expedited and improved in quality by utilizing the LLM's text generation capabilities, making it suitable for an E1 label.
