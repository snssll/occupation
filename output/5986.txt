1: In this task, the Highway Maintenance Workers are required to drive trucks to transport crews and equipment to work sites. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. Driving trucks involves physical actions and real-time decision-making, which cannot be directly assisted by an LLM. The task does not involve text input or output, and the complexity lies in the practical application of driving skills rather than in information processing or generation. Therefore, the task does not align with the capabilities of the LLM, and no exposure label can be applied.
