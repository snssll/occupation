1: In this task, a welder is required to monitor the fitting, burning, and welding processes to prevent overheating or other issues with the materials being worked on. This task involves a hands-on approach where the welder needs to physically observe and adjust the welding processes. The task does not involve text input or output that can be easily processed by an LLM. The LLM does not have the capability to physically monitor or control the welding processes. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not involve any text-based work that can be significantly aided by the LLM.
