1: In this task, the occupation of "Cooks, Private Household" involves planning and preparing food for various events. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to plan and prepare food for parties and events. 

- E0: This task involves hands-on cooking and food preparation, which requires physical skills and sensory perception that cannot be replaced by text-based AI models like the LLM. The LLM cannot physically cook or taste food, so it cannot directly assist in the cooking process.

- E1: While the LLM can provide recipes, suggestions, and general guidance on cooking, it cannot replace the practical skills and experience needed to execute cooking tasks efficiently. The task of planning and preparing food for events involves a hands-on approach that goes beyond text-based instructions.

- E2: It is conceivable that additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to assist with meal planning, recipe organization, and ingredient sourcing for events. This software could potentially streamline the process by providing tailored suggestions and automating certain aspects of event food preparation.

- E3: The task does not involve image processing or detailed visual instructions that would require image capabilities in addition to text-based AI. Therefore, the task does not fall under E3 exposure.
