1: For the task of cleaning food preparation areas, cooking surfaces, and utensils as a Fast Food Cook, the exposure to LLM can be evaluated as follows:

- E1: Direct exposure - The task of cleaning food preparation areas, cooking surfaces, and utensils involves following specific instructions and procedures. An LLM could potentially assist in providing detailed step-by-step instructions on how to clean different surfaces effectively, recommend cleaning products, or suggest time-saving techniques. The LLM could also help in generating checklists or reminders for cleaning schedules. Overall, the task can be significantly streamlined with the direct assistance of an LLM, reducing the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While there may not be specific software applications developed on top of the LLM solely for cleaning tasks, it is conceivable that such tools could be created to provide tailored cleaning instructions, safety guidelines, or even automated checklists based on the specific requirements of fast-food kitchen cleaning. These applications could integrate with the LLM to offer more efficient and customized solutions for cleaning tasks.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities would not significantly impact the task of cleaning food preparation areas, cooking surfaces, and utensils, as it primarily involves text-based instructions and physical cleaning actions. The task does not require reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images, making image capabilities less relevant in this context.
