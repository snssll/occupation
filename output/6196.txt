- Writing and transforming text: The task involves creating clear objectives in written form, which can be done using the LLM.
- Providing edits to existing text: The LLM can assist in refining the language and clarity of the objectives.
- Providing feedback on documents: The LLM can provide feedback on the clarity and effectiveness of the objectives.
- Informing anyone of any information via any written or spoken medium: The LLM can help in communicating the objectives to students, parents, or guardians.
