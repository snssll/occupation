1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of "Observe, interview, and assess patients to identify care needs" for Clinical Nurse Specialists, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. In this task, the LLM could potentially assist by providing guidance on interview questions, suggesting assessment tools, or offering general advice on patient care needs based on common practices in the field. However, the task itself involves direct interaction with patients, which cannot be replaced by the LLM. The LLM can provide information and suggestions, but the core aspect of observing, interviewing, and assessing patients requires human interaction and judgment.

Considering these factors, the task does not fall under E1 as the direct access to the LLM alone cannot reduce the time it takes to complete the task by at least half. Additionally, while it is possible to imagine software that could assist in organizing patient data or providing background information, the fundamental aspects of patient observation and assessment are human-centric and cannot be fully automated. Therefore, the task does not align with E2 either. Since the task involves direct patient interaction and relies heavily on human judgment, it does not require image capabilities for completion, ruling out E3 as well.
