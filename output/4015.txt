1: In this task, a Sales Engineer is responsible for creating sales or service contracts for products or services. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM can assist in completing it. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM can assist in writing and transforming text according to complex instructions, which includes drafting contracts. The model can generate contract templates, fill in specific details based on input, and ensure the language is clear and legally sound. This can significantly reduce the time it takes to create contracts with equivalent quality.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone can draft contracts, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to streamline the process further. This software could include features like retrieving up-to-date legal information, analyzing contract clauses for potential issues, or integrating with existing CRM systems for seamless contract management.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not relevant for this task as it primarily involves text-based work, such as drafting contracts.

Based on the above analysis, the task of creating sales or service contracts for products or services would likely fall under E1: Direct exposure, as the LLM can directly assist in generating and customizing contract documents.
