1: In this task, a Fundraising Manager or Fundraiser is required to conduct research to identify information about potential donors, investors, or general donor markets. With access to the powerful OpenAI large language model (LLM), the Fundraising Manager or Fundraiser can efficiently gather information by inputting specific queries related to the goals, net worth, charitable donation history, or other relevant data of the individuals or markets they are targeting. The LLM can assist in summarizing information from various sources, providing insights, and even generating reports based on the collected data. This process can significantly reduce the time and effort required to manually search for and compile this information.
