1: In this task, the occupation of riggers involves testing rigging to ensure safety and reliability. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality. 

- The task of testing rigging involves practical, hands-on work that requires physical inspection and testing of equipment to ensure safety and reliability.
- While the LLM can provide information on rigging techniques, safety protocols, and general knowledge related to rigging, it cannot physically test the rigging itself.
- The task does not involve writing, summarizing documents, or any other text-based activities that the LLM could directly assist with.
- The nature of the task is more practical and hands-on, which does not align with the capabilities of the LLM.

Based on these considerations, the task of testing rigging to ensure safety and reliability would be classified as E0 - No exposure.

2: E0
