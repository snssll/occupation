1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of training system users in system operation or maintenance for Computer Systems Engineers/Architects, we need to consider the nature of the task and how LLM exposure could impact it:

- Computer Systems Engineers/Architects typically need to provide training to users on how to operate or maintain complex computer systems. This task involves explaining technical concepts, demonstrating procedures, and answering questions from users.
- With direct access to the LLM, a Computer Systems Engineer/Architect could potentially use the model to generate training materials, create documentation, or even simulate user interactions for training purposes. The LLM could assist in preparing training materials based on general knowledge or answering questions about the system operation.
- While the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time it takes to train system users compared to traditional methods, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to create interactive training modules, provide real-time troubleshooting guidance, or offer personalized training based on user feedback. Such software could potentially cut the training time in half by enhancing the training experience and efficiency.

Based on these considerations, the task of training system users in system operation or maintenance for Computer Systems Engineers/Architects falls under the label E2 - Exposure by LLM-powered applications.
