1: In this task, an Insurance Claims and Policy Processing Clerk is required to obtain a computer printout of policy cancellations or retrieve cancellation cards from a file. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves retrieving specific information from a database or file system, which can be easily accomplished by an LLM through text input and output. The LLM can understand the request for policy cancellations and retrieve the necessary information.
- The task does not involve complex decision-making, precise measurements, human interaction, or detailed visuals. It is primarily a data retrieval task that can be streamlined through text-based interactions with the LLM.
- While the task does not involve image capabilities, it falls under the category of maintaining records of written data, which aligns with the capabilities of the LLM.

Based on these considerations, the task of obtaining computer printouts of policy cancellations or retrieving cancellation cards from a file would likely fall under the E1 label. The LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality by providing the necessary information through text-based interactions.
