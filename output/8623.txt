1: In this task, an Animal Control Worker is responsible for issuing warnings or citations in connection with animal-related offenses, or contacting the police to report violations and request arrests. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves primarily written communication, such as issuing warnings or citations, and contacting the police via written reports.
- The task does not require specialized domain knowledge beyond general understanding of animal-related offenses and procedures.
- The task does not involve complex data analysis or decision-making that would require advanced capabilities beyond text processing.
- The task does not involve creating or editing images, reading text from PDFs, or any other image-related activities.

Based on these considerations, the task falls under E1 as it involves writing and transforming text according to specific instructions, which can be efficiently handled by the LLM. The LLM can assist in drafting warnings, citations, and reports, thereby reducing the time needed to complete the task.
