1: In this task, a Light Truck Driver is required to report any mechanical problems encountered with vehicles. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be completed with the help of an LLM.

- The task involves reporting mechanical problems, which is primarily a hands-on task that requires physical inspection and assessment of the vehicle.
- While an LLM could potentially assist in documenting the issues in a written format, it cannot physically inspect the vehicle or diagnose mechanical problems.
- The task does not involve complex data analysis, decision-making, or specialized knowledge that would significantly benefit from LLM capabilities.
- The task does not involve text generation, translation, summarization, or any other text-based activities where an LLM could provide substantial assistance.

Based on these considerations, the task of reporting mechanical problems encountered with vehicles is best classified as E0 - No exposure to LLM.
