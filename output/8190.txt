1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of installing skylights on roofs as part of the occupation of roofers, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be impacted by the capabilities of the LLM.

- The task of installing skylights on roofs involves physical labor, precise measurements, and technical skills that cannot be directly replaced by text-based instructions or information provided by the LLM.
- The task requires hands-on work, climbing roofs, handling materials, and ensuring proper installation, which are not tasks that can be completed by the LLM.
- While the LLM could potentially provide information on best practices for skylight installation or answer theoretical questions about the process, it cannot physically perform the installation itself.
- The task does not involve written or spoken communication that could be significantly enhanced by the LLM.

Based on these considerations, the task of installing skylights on roofs as part of the occupation of roofers would be classified as E0 - No exposure.
