1: In this task, a neurologist examines patients to gather information about various aspects of their functional status. This involves assessing vision, physical strength, coordination, reflexes, sensations, language skills, cognitive abilities, and mental status. To complete this task, the neurologist needs to interact directly with the patient, perform physical examinations, and conduct cognitive assessments. The task does not involve text-based information processing or analysis that could be significantly aided by an LLM. As such, this task falls under E0 as it requires a high degree of human interaction and physical examination, which cannot be replaced or significantly expedited by the use of an LLM.

2: E0

3: High
