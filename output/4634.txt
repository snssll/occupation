1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of determining proper storage methods, identification, and stock location for Stockers and Order Fillers, we need to consider the level of exposure to LLM. This task involves analyzing various factors such as turnover, environmental conditions, and physical capabilities of facilities to make decisions on storage methods. The LLM can assist in providing information on best practices for storage, identifying trends in turnover rates, and suggesting suitable stock locations based on environmental factors. The model can also generate recommendations for optimizing storage space and efficiency.

Given that the task involves analyzing data and making decisions based on various factors, the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task by providing relevant information and recommendations. The model can process and analyze large amounts of data quickly, which would be time-consuming for a human to do manually. Therefore, this task falls under the category of E1 - Direct exposure to LLM.
