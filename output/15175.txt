1: In this task, an Information Security Analyst is required to review violations of computer security procedures and discuss procedures with violators to ensure violations are not repeated. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could assist in completing it. 

- The task involves reviewing violations of computer security procedures, which may require understanding complex security protocols, policies, and technical details. The LLM can assist in providing information on best practices, guidelines, and potential security vulnerabilities based on the input provided.
- Discussing procedures with violators involves communication skills, understanding the context of the violation, and potentially providing recommendations for improvement. The LLM can help in generating responses, drafting communication scripts, and providing insights on how to address security breaches effectively.

Considering the task involves a mix of technical knowledge, communication skills, and problem-solving, the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to draft responses, generate communication scripts, and provide insights on security procedures. Therefore, this task falls under the E1 label as direct access to the LLM can reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality by at least half.
