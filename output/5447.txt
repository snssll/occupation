1: In this task, a Transportation Inspector is responsible for directing crews to reload freight or add bracing or packing as needed. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we can break down the task:
- The task involves providing instructions based on specific criteria and conditions, which can be effectively communicated through text.
- The task does not require specialized domain knowledge beyond what the LLM can provide.
- The task does not involve complex databases, up-to-date facts retrieval, or highly specialized knowledge.
- The task does not require image capabilities for reading text from PDFs or creating/editing digital images.

Based on these considerations, the task can be completed efficiently with the help of the LLM by providing clear instructions and guidance in text form.
