1: In this task, the helper-electrician is responsible for bolting component parts together to form tower assemblies using hand tools. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality. Since this task involves physical work with hand tools and does not require any text input or output, the LLM would not be able to directly assist in completing the task. The LLM cannot physically bolt component parts together, so it cannot reduce the time it takes to complete this task.
