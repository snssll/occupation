1: In this task, an astronomer is required to measure various types of emissions from extraterrestrial sources such as radio, infrared, gamma, and x-ray emissions. To complete this task, the astronomer would need specialized equipment, knowledge of astronomical phenomena, and data analysis skills. The task involves physical measurements and data interpretation that cannot be directly performed by an LLM. While an LLM could potentially provide information on the theoretical aspects of these emissions or assist in analyzing data, it cannot physically measure the emissions from extraterrestrial sources. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not involve text-based inputs or outputs that can be directly handled by an LLM.

2: E0
