1: In this task, the New Accounts Clerk needs to refer customers to the appropriate bank personnel to meet their financial needs. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone or with additional software could significantly reduce the time it takes for a New Accounts Clerk to complete this task with high quality.

- E0: This task involves human interaction and decision-making based on customer needs, which cannot be fully automated by the LLM or any software built on top of it. The task requires understanding the specific financial needs of customers and directing them to the right personnel, which involves a level of judgment and interpersonal skills that cannot be replicated by the LLM.

- E1: While the LLM could potentially provide general information on financial services or common customer needs, it cannot fully replace the role of a New Accounts Clerk in assessing individual customer requirements and making personalized recommendations. The task involves a level of nuance and context that may not be effectively captured by the LLM alone.

- E2: It is conceivable that additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to assist New Accounts Clerks by providing recommendations based on customer data analysis or suggesting common financial services based on trends. However, the core aspect of understanding and addressing individual customer needs would still require human judgment and interaction.

- E3: The task does not involve image processing capabilities, so exposure to image capabilities would not significantly impact the completion of this task.
