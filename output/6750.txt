1: In this task, the occupation involves helpers who assist in laying and joining pipes for water and sewer service. The task specifically mentions excavating and grading ditches, which are physical activities that require manual labor and on-site presence. The task does not involve complex decision-making, analysis, or specialized knowledge that would benefit significantly from the use of an LLM. The LLM cannot physically excavate or grade ditches, and the task does not involve written or spoken communication that would be significantly enhanced by the LLM. Therefore, the task does not align with any of the exposure levels in the rubric.
