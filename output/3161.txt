1: In this task, an Ophthalmic Medical Technologist or Technician conducts visual field tests to measure a patient's field of vision. This task involves administering specific tests, analyzing the results, and documenting the findings accurately. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes to conduct visual field tests and analyze the results.

- E0: This task involves hands-on interaction with patients, precise measurements, and specialized medical knowledge that cannot be effectively replaced by the LLM alone. The LLM does not have the capability to physically administer tests or interact with patients, making it unsuitable for this task.

- E1: While the LLM could potentially provide general information on visual field tests and their interpretation, it cannot directly conduct the tests or analyze the results. The specialized nature of this task requires hands-on skills and medical expertise that the LLM lacks.

- E2: It is conceivable that additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to assist in summarizing research articles related to visual field tests or providing recommendations based on the test results. However, the core task of conducting the tests and interpreting the results still heavily relies on practical skills and medical knowledge beyond the capabilities of the LLM alone.

- E3: The task of conducting visual field tests involves practical skills and interactions with physical equipment that cannot be replaced by the LLM, even with image capabilities. While the LLM could potentially assist in generating reports or analyzing data related to visual field tests, the core aspects of this task require hands-on work that goes beyond the capabilities of the LLM.
