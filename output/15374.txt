1: In this task, a Recreational Vehicle Service Technician or Manufactured Building and Mobile Home Installer seals the open sides of modular units to prepare them for shipment. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. This task involves manual labor, such as using polyethylene sheets, nails, and hammers, which cannot be directly automated by an LLM. The task requires physical dexterity and the ability to work with materials in a hands-on manner, which is beyond the capabilities of text-based AI models like the LLM. As such, this task does not involve text input or output that can be processed by the LLM to significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not meet the criteria for exposure to LLM capabilities.

2: E0
