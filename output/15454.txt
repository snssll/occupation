1: In this task, the occupation involves preparing coating substances by selecting and mixing ingredients according to specifications. To determine the exposure level, we need to consider if the task can be completed more efficiently with the help of an LLM. The task itself is very hands-on and requires physical manipulation of ingredients and machinery, which cannot be directly assisted by an LLM. While the LLM could potentially provide information on coating substances or mixing techniques, the core task of physically selecting and mixing ingredients is not something the LLM can directly assist with. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not significantly benefit from LLM assistance.
