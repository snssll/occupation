1: In this task, a tutor is required to administer, proctor, or score academic or diagnostic assessments. With the help of the LLM, the tutor could potentially generate assessment questions, provide feedback on assessments, or even assist in scoring assessments by providing detailed explanations or examples. The LLM could also help in creating personalized assessments based on the student's needs and abilities. However, the task of physically administering or proctoring assessments, especially in a controlled environment, cannot be directly assisted by the LLM. Therefore, while the LLM can aid in certain aspects of the task, it cannot fully replace the human role in administering or proctoring assessments.
