1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of designing or developing automated testing tools as a Software Quality Assurance Analysts and Testers, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The task involves writing code to create automated testing tools, which can be done using the LLM. The LLM can assist in generating code snippets, providing guidance on best practices, and helping with debugging. Therefore, this task can be significantly expedited with the direct use of the LLM.
  
- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone can assist in writing code for automated testing tools, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to streamline the process further. This software could provide more specialized recommendations, offer advanced debugging techniques, or even automate the testing tool development process to a greater extent.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not relevant for this task as it primarily involves coding and software development, which can be handled by the LLM without the need for image processing.

Considering the task involves writing code and developing automated testing tools, the most suitable label would be E1: Direct exposure.

2: E1

3: High
