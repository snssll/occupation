1: In this task, an Occupational Therapist is helping clients improve various cognitive skills using computer programs. With the help of a large language model (LLM), the therapist could potentially gather information on the latest research, techniques, and best practices in cognitive rehabilitation. The LLM could assist in generating personalized exercises or programs tailored to each client's needs based on the input provided by the therapist. Additionally, the LLM could help in creating detailed reports or progress notes for each client, documenting their improvements and areas of focus. Overall, the LLM could significantly streamline the process of designing and implementing cognitive rehabilitation programs for clients.

Considering the above points, this task falls under E2 - Exposure by LLM-powered applications. While direct access to the LLM alone may not reduce the time it takes to complete the task by at least half, additional software developed on top of the LLM could enhance the therapist's ability to create personalized cognitive rehabilitation programs efficiently.
