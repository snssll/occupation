1: In this task, the main responsibility is to produce films and other video products, regulate their distribution, and operate a film library. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone or with additional software could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task. 

- E0: This task involves producing films and video products, which require visual and audio elements that the LLM alone cannot create. Additionally, operating a film library involves physical tasks like organizing and managing physical media, which the LLM cannot assist with. Therefore, this task is unlikely to be significantly impacted by LLM capabilities.

- E1: While the LLM could potentially assist in writing scripts or providing information related to film production, the core tasks of producing films, regulating distribution, and operating a film library involve practical, hands-on work that the LLM cannot perform. The LLM may help with some aspects of research or planning, but it cannot directly replace the physical and technical aspects of video production and library management.

- E2: It is conceivable that additional software built on top of the LLM could assist in tasks like summarizing scripts, providing recommendations based on data analysis, or retrieving information related to film production. However, the fundamental tasks of producing films, regulating distribution, and operating a film library still require specialized skills and physical work that go beyond the capabilities of the LLM alone.

- E3: The task involves producing films and video products, which may benefit from image capabilities for visual content creation. However, the LLM's image capabilities are limited, and the task also involves physical aspects like operating a film library, which cannot be directly addressed by image capabilities alone.
