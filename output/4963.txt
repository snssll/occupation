1: For the task of developing new analytical techniques or sensor systems as a Remote Sensing Scientist or Technologist, the exposure to LLM can be evaluated as follows:

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** The task involves a high level of technical expertise and specialized knowledge in remote sensing technology. While the LLM can assist in providing general information or explanations related to remote sensing, it may not have the specific domain knowledge required to develop new analytical techniques or sensor systems. The task is highly specialized and requires hands-on experience and expertise in the field, which the LLM may not possess.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** It is conceivable that additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to assist Remote Sensing Scientists and Technologists in developing new analytical techniques or sensor systems. This software could potentially help in generating ideas, providing literature reviews, or even assisting in the initial stages of research and development. However, the actual implementation and detailed technical work would still require human expertise.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** The task of developing new analytical techniques or sensor systems may involve working with images and data from remote sensing technologies. Having access to image capabilities alongside the LLM could potentially aid in visualizing concepts, creating diagrams, or interpreting image data. However, the task itself is more focused on the technical aspects of sensor systems and analytical techniques rather than image processing.

Based on the above analysis, the task of developing new analytical techniques or sensor systems as a Remote Sensing Scientist or Technologist is best classified as **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications)**.
