1: In this task, a stonemason is required to lay out wall patterns or foundations using tools like a straight edge, rule, or staked lines. This task involves physical work and precise measurements, which cannot be directly assisted by an LLM. The LLM cannot perform tasks that require physical labor or precise measurements, so it cannot significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not benefit from the capabilities of the LLM.

2: E0
