1: In this task, the Social and Human Service Assistants are required to assist in locating housing for displaced individuals. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves providing a service by locating housing for displaced individuals, which primarily involves communication, coordination, and possibly research.
- The task does not require precise measurements, detailed visuals, or physical interactions.
- The task can be broken down into steps that involve written communication, data gathering, and potentially decision-making based on the information gathered.
- The task does not involve highly specialized domain knowledge or complex databases.

Based on these considerations, the task of assisting in locating housing for displaced individuals could benefit from the capabilities of an LLM to help with written communication, research, and potentially decision-making based on the information gathered. Therefore, this task falls under the E1 label as direct access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality.
