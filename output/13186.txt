1: In this task, a Parking Enforcement Worker is required to provide assistance to motorists facing issues like flat tires, keys locked in cars, or dead batteries. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if the task can be significantly expedited or improved by using the LLM. Since the task involves physical assistance and direct interaction with individuals in distress, it does not seem feasible for the LLM to directly assist in this scenario. The LLM cannot physically help with changing tires, unlocking cars, or jump-starting batteries. Additionally, the task does not involve complex data analysis, decision-making, or information retrieval that would benefit from the LLM's capabilities. Therefore, the task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM or systems built on top of it.
