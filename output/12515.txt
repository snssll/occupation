1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of preparing estimates as a Cost Estimator, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it. 

- Cost estimators typically rely on historical data, industry knowledge, and project details to create accurate estimates.
- The task involves analyzing various factors to provide estimates for management decision-making.
- The LLM could assist in providing relevant industry data, historical trends, and potentially help in organizing and presenting the estimates in a clear manner.

Given these considerations, the LLM could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task by providing access to relevant data, assisting in organizing information, and potentially automating parts of the estimation process. This task falls under E1 as the LLM can directly assist in writing and transforming text (estimates) according to complex instructions, providing edits to existing text (estimates), and maintaining records of written data (estimates used by management).
