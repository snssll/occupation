1: Commercial Pilots are responsible for ensuring the safety of the aircraft, passengers, and cargo during flights. One of the tasks they perform is checking baggage or cargo to ensure that it has been loaded correctly. This task involves physically inspecting the baggage or cargo to verify that it has been loaded according to safety regulations and weight distribution requirements. Since this task requires physical inspection and verification, it does not involve text-based or data-driven analysis that could benefit significantly from the capabilities of an LLM. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not align with the criteria for exposure to LLM capabilities.
