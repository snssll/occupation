To complete this task, the therapist would need to provide instruction, guidance, and feedback to students, as well as potentially create educational materials. With the help of the LLM, the therapist could easily generate lesson plans, create educational materials, provide feedback on assignments, and even answer questions from students. The LLM could assist in summarizing complex information, generating questions for assessments, and providing explanations on various topics related to physical therapy.
