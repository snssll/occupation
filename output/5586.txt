1: In this task, a Regulatory Affairs Manager is responsible for directing the preparation and submission of regulatory agency applications, reports, or correspondence. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves a significant amount of writing and coordination of regulatory documents. An LLM could assist in drafting these documents, providing guidance on regulatory requirements, and even suggesting language for reports or correspondence. The LLM could also help in summarizing regulations or previous submissions for reference. However, the task may involve specialized knowledge of regulatory processes and requirements that the LLM alone may not possess. Therefore, while the LLM can aid in the writing and organization aspects of the task, it may not fully replace the expertise needed to navigate the regulatory landscape.
