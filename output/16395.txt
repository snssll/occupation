1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of studying product characteristics or customer requirements as a Validation Engineer, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be supported by the capabilities of the LLM.

- The task involves studying product characteristics and customer requirements, which primarily requires reading and understanding text-based information.
- The LLM can assist in summarizing and analyzing text, providing insights, and generating relevant questions based on the input data.
- The LLM can also help in researching related standards or best practices in validation processes.
- While the LLM can provide valuable information and insights, it may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task by half, as the task involves a high level of domain-specific knowledge and analysis.

Based on these considerations, the task of studying product characteristics or customer requirements as a Validation Engineer would likely fall under label E2 - Exposure by LLM-powered applications. While the LLM can provide valuable support and information, additional software tailored to the specific needs of validation engineering could further enhance the efficiency of completing this task.
