1: In this task, a welder, cutter, solderer, or brazer is required to clean or degrease parts using wire brushes, portable grinders, or chemical baths. This task involves physical actions such as using tools and chemicals to clean the parts, which cannot be directly performed by an LLM. The task does not involve complex decision-making, specialized knowledge retrieval, or information synthesis that would significantly benefit from LLM capabilities. Therefore, this task does not align with any of the exposure levels (E1, E2, E3) as it does not involve text input or output, and the use of an LLM would not reduce the time it takes to complete the task.

2: E0
