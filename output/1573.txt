The LLM could also generate reports or summaries based on the input data provided for budgeting and scheduling purposes. However, since this task involves specific domain knowledge related to security management and design work, the LLM alone may not have the expertise to fully understand the intricacies of security requirements and constraints. Therefore, while the LLM can provide some support in terms of generating text and basic recommendations, it may not significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete the task with high quality.
