1: In this task, a Social Science Research Assistant is required to prepare tables, graphs, fact sheets, and written reports summarizing research results. With the help of the most powerful OpenAI large language model (LLM), the assistant can efficiently generate written reports summarizing research results. The LLM can assist in summarizing the data, findings, and conclusions in a coherent and structured manner. It can also help in organizing the information into tables and graphs to present the results visually. However, the LLM alone may not be able to create complex tables and graphs from raw data without specific instructions or templates. Additionally, the LLM may not be able to generate fact sheets with up-to-date information unless provided in the input. Therefore, while the LLM can significantly aid in the writing aspect of the task, additional software with more specialized capabilities would be needed to fully automate the creation of tables, graphs, and fact sheets.
