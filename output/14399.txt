1: In this task, a Motion Picture Projectionist is responsible for removing full take-up reels and running film through rewinding machines to prepare the films for future showings. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves physical manipulation of film reels and rewinding machines, which cannot be directly assisted by an LLM. The task does not involve complex decision-making, analysis, or information retrieval that would benefit significantly from LLM capabilities. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM or any tools built on top of it.

2: E0
