1: In this task, an Occupational Therapy Assistant is required to select therapy activities tailored to each patient's specific needs and capabilities. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes for an Occupational Therapy Assistant to complete this task with high quality. 

- E0: This task involves a high degree of human interaction and requires the expertise of an Occupational Therapy Assistant to assess patients' needs and capabilities accurately. The task also involves physical activities and observations that cannot be replaced by text-based tools like the LLM.

- E1: While the LLM could potentially provide general information on therapy activities, it cannot replace the hands-on assessment and personalized approach that an Occupational Therapy Assistant provides. The task requires a deep understanding of each patient's condition, which goes beyond what the LLM can offer.

- E2: It is conceivable that specialized software could be developed on top of the LLM to assist Occupational Therapy Assistants in selecting therapy activities. This software could potentially provide recommendations based on general guidelines and best practices in occupational therapy. However, the complex nature of patient assessments and the need for personalized care may limit the effectiveness of such software.

- E3: The task does not involve image processing or detailed visual analysis that would benefit from additional image capabilities. Therefore, access to image capabilities would not significantly impact the completion of this task.
