1: In this task, a Radiation Therapist administers prescribed doses of radiation to specific body parts using radiation therapy equipment. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes for a Radiation Therapist to complete this task with high quality. 

- E0: This task involves hands-on work with radiation therapy equipment, precise measurements, and direct interaction with patients. The LLM cannot physically administer radiation or interact with patients, so it cannot reduce the time it takes to complete this task.
- E1: The LLM cannot physically administer radiation or operate equipment, so it cannot directly assist in completing this task by at least half.
- E2: While the LLM could potentially provide information on radiation therapy practices and standards, it cannot replace the practical skills and hands-on work required to administer radiation doses accurately. Developing software on top of the LLM to assist with this task would be highly complex and may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task.
- E3: The LLM does not have image capabilities that would be relevant to administering radiation therapy, so it cannot assist in completing this task.

Based on the above reasoning, the most appropriate label for this task is E0.

2: E0

3: High
