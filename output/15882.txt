1: In this task, an Aircraft Structure, Surfaces, Rigging, and Systems Assembler is required to set, align, adjust, or synchronize aircraft armament or rigging or control system components to established tolerances or requirements using sighting devices and hand tools. This task involves a high level of precision and manual dexterity. The task does not involve text-based inputs or outputs that can be easily processed by an LLM. The task also requires physical manipulation of components and tools, which cannot be directly assisted by an LLM. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not benefit from the capabilities of an LLM.

2: E0

3: High
