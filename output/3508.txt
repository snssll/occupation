1: In this task, a Video Game Designer is required to consult with multiple stakeholders to define requirements and implement online features for a video game. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it. 

- E0: This task involves direct human interaction and decision-making with stakeholders, which cannot be fully automated by the LLM. The consultation process requires nuanced communication, understanding of stakeholder needs, and collaborative decision-making, which are not easily replaced by AI.

- E1: While the LLM could potentially assist in drafting initial communication or documentation related to the requirements, the core aspect of consulting with stakeholders and implementing online features involves human judgment, creativity, and collaboration, which the LLM cannot fully replicate.

- E2: It is conceivable that additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to streamline the documentation process, provide templates for stakeholder communication, or even suggest online feature implementations based on data analysis. However, the core aspects of stakeholder consultation and decision-making would still require human intervention.

- E3: The task does not involve image processing or detailed visual information that would significantly benefit from image capabilities in conjunction with the LLM.

2: E0

3: Certainty level: High
