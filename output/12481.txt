1: In this task, an Art Director is required to prepare detailed storyboards for television production, showing the sequence and timing of story development. To complete this task, the Art Director needs to have a strong understanding of visual storytelling, composition, and pacing. While an LLM could potentially assist in generating text descriptions of scenes or providing general advice on story development, it lacks the visual capabilities necessary to create detailed storyboards. The task involves a high degree of visual creativity and precision, which the LLM alone cannot provide. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not clearly decrease the time it takes for an experienced Art Director to complete the task with high quality by at least half.

2: E0
