1: In this task of washing and sorting pelts according to species, color, and quality, the most relevant exposure label from the rubric would be E0. This task involves physical work that cannot be directly performed by an LLM or any software tool. It requires hands-on interaction with the pelts, which cannot be replicated by text-based models or image capabilities. The task also does not involve complex decision-making that could be automated by an LLM.
