1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of verifying income eligibility of participants in publicly financed weatherization programs as an Energy Auditor, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be aided by the LLM.

- Energy Auditors typically need to review documents, guidelines, and regulations to ensure that participants meet income eligibility criteria for weatherization programs.
- The task involves analyzing and interpreting information provided by participants to determine their eligibility.
- The LLM can assist in summarizing guidelines and regulations related to income eligibility criteria for weatherization programs.
- The LLM can help in generating questions to ask participants to verify their income eligibility.
- The LLM can provide feedback on documents submitted by participants to assess their income eligibility.

Considering the above points, the task can be significantly aided by the LLM in terms of summarizing information, generating questions, and providing feedback, which would reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality.
