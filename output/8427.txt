1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of interviewing employers and employees to obtain information about work environments and workplace incidents as a Health and Safety Engineer, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be supported by the capabilities of the LLM.

- E1: Direct exposure - The task involves gathering information through interviews, which can be formulated as text input and output. The LLM can assist in generating questions for interviews, summarizing responses, and potentially providing guidance on follow-up questions based on the input. The LLM can help in structuring the interview process and analyzing the gathered information.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM can aid in text-based tasks related to interviews, additional software could be developed to streamline the process further. This software could include features like summarizing interview responses, analyzing trends in workplace incidents, and providing recommendations based on the gathered data. Such tools could enhance the efficiency of the interview process and data analysis.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Since the task primarily involves text-based interactions (interviews), the image capabilities of the LLM are not directly relevant in this context. Reading text from documents or scanning images is not a significant aspect of this task.
