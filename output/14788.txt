1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of researching or evaluating new technologies for use in fraud detection systems as a Fraud Examiner, Investigator, or Analyst, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can benefit from the capabilities of the LLM.

- E0: This task involves researching and evaluating new technologies, which may require a high level of expertise, critical thinking, and domain-specific knowledge. While the LLM can provide information and insights, the task likely involves assessing complex technical details, performance metrics, and practical applications of technologies, which may not be effectively addressed solely by the LLM.

- E1: The LLM can assist in gathering information about new technologies, providing insights on fraud detection systems, and potentially summarizing existing research. However, the task of evaluating and making decisions on the suitability of technologies for fraud detection systems may require specialized knowledge, technical expertise, and hands-on testing that go beyond the capabilities of the LLM.

- E2: While the LLM can help in researching and summarizing information on new technologies, additional software that integrates with the LLM could be developed to analyze technical specifications, compare performance metrics, and provide recommendations based on domain-specific knowledge. Such software could enhance the efficiency of evaluating technologies for fraud detection systems.

- E3: The task does not involve image processing or detailed visual analysis, so the image capabilities of the LLM are not directly relevant in this context.

Based on the considerations above, the task of researching or evaluating new technologies for use in fraud detection systems is best classified as E2.
