1: In this task, a cleaner of vehicles and equipment is required to pre-soak or rinse machine parts, equipment, or vehicles by immersing objects in cleaning solutions or water, manually or using hoists. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The task involves a straightforward and repetitive action of pre-soaking or rinsing machine parts, equipment, or vehicles. The LLM could potentially provide guidance on the best cleaning solutions or techniques to use, but the actual physical act of immersing objects in solutions or water cannot be automated by the LLM. Therefore, direct access to the LLM would not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM itself may not directly reduce the time to complete the task, it is conceivable that additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to provide guidance on specific cleaning solutions, safety protocols, or equipment maintenance. This software could potentially streamline the process and improve efficiency, but it would not automate the physical aspect of pre-soaking or rinsing objects.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - The task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images, so access to image capabilities would not significantly impact the completion of this task.
