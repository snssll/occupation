1: In this task, a taper works on high ceilings using tools like scaffolding or stilts. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM or LLM-powered tools can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality. Since this task involves physical work at heights using specialized tools, it does not seem like the LLM or LLM-powered tools can assist in completing the task. The task requires physical presence, manual dexterity, and safety considerations that cannot be addressed by text-based AI models.
