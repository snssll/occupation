1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of assessing the marketing potential of new and existing store locations as a Sales Manager, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be impacted by the use of the LLM.

- The task involves analyzing statistics and expenditures to evaluate the marketing potential of store locations. This task requires understanding data, making informed decisions, and potentially generating insights based on the analysis.
- The LLM can assist in providing information on marketing strategies, industry trends, and best practices related to store location assessment.
- The LLM can help in summarizing data, generating reports, and even providing recommendations based on the analysis of statistics and expenditures.
