1: In this task, the occupation involves providing assistance to extraction craft workers like earth drillers and derrick operators. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be significantly expedited or improved by using the language model. In this case, the task involves assisting workers in the extraction industry, which may require physical tasks, hands-on assistance, and real-time coordination. The task description does not explicitly involve extensive text-based activities that could be directly enhanced by the LLM. While the LLM could potentially provide information or guidance related to extraction processes, it is unlikely to significantly reduce the time it takes to physically assist extraction workers.
