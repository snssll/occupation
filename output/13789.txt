1: In this task, a Food and Tobacco Roasting, Baking, and Drying Machine Operator and Tender needs to read work orders to determine quantities and types of products to be baked, dried, or roasted. This task involves reading and interpreting text, understanding instructions, and applying them to the operation of the machines. 

To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we can consider the following:
- The task involves reading and interpreting text, which is a core capability of the LLM.
- The LLM can assist in understanding work orders, clarifying any ambiguities, and potentially even suggesting optimal settings for baking, drying, or roasting based on the input.
- While the LLM can help with understanding the text-based instructions, it may not significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task, as the actual operation of the machines and the physical aspects of the job are not within the LLM's capabilities.

Based on these considerations, the task falls under E2 - Exposure by LLM-powered applications. While the LLM can assist in understanding and interpreting the work orders, additional software that integrates with the LLM could potentially be developed to further streamline the process.
