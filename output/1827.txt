1: In this task, the Operating Engineers and Other Construction Equipment Operators are required to check fuel supplies at sites to ensure adequate availability. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. Checking fuel supplies involves a straightforward and routine inspection process that does not require complex decision-making or specialized knowledge beyond basic operational procedures. The task does not involve text input or output, complex data analysis, or specialized domain knowledge that would benefit significantly from the capabilities of a large language model (LLM). Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not clearly decrease the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete the task with high quality by at least half.

2: E0
