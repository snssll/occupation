1: In this task, a general dentist is required to eliminate irritating margins of fillings and correct occlusions using dental instruments. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves manual dexterity, precision, and real-time decision-making based on the patient's specific oral condition. It requires physical interaction with the patient, as well as the ability to feel the textures and make adjustments based on tactile feedback. Since this task involves hands-on work that cannot be replicated by an LLM or any software tool, it falls under the E0 category. The task requires a high degree of human interaction, precise measurements, and physical manipulation, making it unsuitable for automation through LLM or LLM-powered tools.
