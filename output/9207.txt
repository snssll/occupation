1: In this task, an Animal Breeder is responsible for maintaining logs of semen specimens used and animals bred. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves recording and maintaining data, which can be easily done using text input and output. 
- The task does not require specialized domain knowledge beyond basic understanding of animal breeding practices.
- The task does not involve complex decision-making or analysis beyond recording information accurately.

Given these considerations, the task can be effectively completed using the LLM to input and maintain the logs of semen specimens and animals bred. The LLM can easily handle text-based data entry and management, making the task more efficient.
