1: In this task, a Structural Metal Fabricator and Fitter is required to hammer, chip, and grind workpieces to cut, bend, and straighten metal. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality. Given that this task involves physical actions such as hammering, chipping, and grinding metal workpieces, it does not involve text input or output that can be processed by the LLM. The LLM does not have the capability to perform physical tasks or interact with physical objects, so it cannot directly assist in completing this task. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not meet the criteria for exposure to LLM.

2: E0

3: High
