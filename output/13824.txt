1: For the task of receiving and placing telephone calls as a Legal Secretary or Administrative Assistant, the exposure to LLM can be evaluated as follows:

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM could potentially assist in drafting scripts for phone calls, providing templates for common inquiries, or even generating responses to frequently asked questions. It could also help in summarizing call details or logging call information efficiently. Overall, the LLM could significantly reduce the time needed to handle phone calls effectively in a legal setting.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While there may not be specific applications developed solely for handling phone calls in a legal context, it is conceivable that with additional software development, the LLM could be integrated into a system that automates call management, schedules appointments based on call content, or even provides legal information during calls. This could streamline the process further but might not be readily available without additional development.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities would not significantly impact the task of receiving and placing telephone calls, as it is primarily text-based and does not involve image processing.

Considering the above points, the task of receiving and placing telephone calls as a Legal Secretary or Administrative Assistant would likely fall under **E1: Direct exposure** to the LLM.
