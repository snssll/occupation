1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of participating in continuing education to stay abreast of industry trends and developments as a First-Line Supervisor, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be supported by the capabilities of the LLM.

- E0: This task involves staying updated on industry trends and developments, which may require attending specific training sessions, workshops, or courses. The task does not involve direct text-based information processing or generation that could be significantly enhanced by the LLM.

- E1: While the LLM could potentially provide information on industry trends and developments through text-based resources, the task of participating in continuing education likely involves practical, hands-on learning experiences that cannot be fully replaced by the LLM. The LLM may assist in summarizing relevant information or providing insights, but it cannot directly substitute for the interactive and experiential nature of continuing education.

- E2: Although the LLM could be used to gather information on industry trends and developments, the task of participating in continuing education involves more than just accessing and processing information. It requires active engagement, discussion, and application of knowledge in real-world scenarios. While additional software could be developed to streamline the process of accessing relevant educational resources, the core task of participating in continuing education would still require human involvement beyond what the LLM can provide.

- E3: The task of participating in continuing education does not involve image processing or creation, so the image capabilities of the LLM are not directly relevant to this task.
