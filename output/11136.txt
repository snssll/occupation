1: In this task, an Electrical and Electronic Equipment Assembler is required to pack finished assemblies for shipment and transport them to storage areas using hoists or handtrucks. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality. Since this task involves physical actions such as packing and transporting items, it does not seem feasible for the LLM to directly assist in completing the task. The LLM cannot perform physical actions or interact with physical objects, so it cannot directly pack or transport items. Therefore, the task does not fall under E1, E2, or E3 as the LLM cannot assist in completing the physical aspects of the task.

2: E0

3: High
