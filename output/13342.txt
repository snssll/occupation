1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of providing information about community health and social resources as a midwife, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be completed with the help of an LLM.

- The task involves providing information about community health and social resources, which requires knowledge of various resources available in the community.
- An LLM can assist in generating text-based information about community health resources based on existing knowledge and data.
- The LLM can help in summarizing information, generating lists of resources, and providing details about specific services available in the community.
- The task does not involve any visual elements or detailed image processing, so image capabilities are not necessary.
- While the task may benefit from additional software that could potentially be developed to enhance the process of gathering and presenting information, the core task of providing information about community health and social resources can be effectively completed with the direct use of an LLM.

Based on these considerations, the task of providing information about community health and social resources as a midwife would fall under label E1 - Direct exposure.
