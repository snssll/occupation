1: In this task, a Fast Food and Counter Worker is responsible for accepting payment from customers and making change as necessary. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves basic arithmetic calculations to determine the change due to customers. An LLM could potentially assist in providing guidance on how to calculate change accurately or even provide sample responses for common payment scenarios. However, this task does not involve complex instructions, specialized domain knowledge, or the need for image capabilities. The task is straightforward and does not require extensive text transformation, data analysis, or decision-making beyond basic arithmetic. Therefore, the exposure to LLM for this task would not significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete it with high quality.
