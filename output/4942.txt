1: In this task, an Insurance Sales Agent is required to develop marketing strategies to compete with other individuals or companies selling insurance. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could assist in completing it. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM could help in generating ideas for marketing strategies, providing insights on current trends in the insurance industry, and drafting compelling marketing content. It can assist in brainstorming different approaches and refining the strategies based on the input provided. The LLM's ability to generate text and provide information could significantly reduce the time it takes to develop marketing strategies.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone can be helpful in generating content and ideas, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to analyze market data, competitor strategies, and consumer behavior to provide more targeted recommendations for marketing strategies. This additional software could enhance the capabilities of the LLM in developing competitive marketing strategies.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not directly relevant to developing marketing strategies in this context, so this label is not applicable.

Based on the above analysis, the task of developing marketing strategies for Insurance Sales Agents aligns best with the E1 label as the LLM can directly assist in generating ideas and content for marketing strategies.
