1: In this task, a Structural Iron and Steel Worker is required to connect columns, beams, and girders with bolts according to blueprints and instructions from supervisors. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves physical work that requires manual dexterity and the ability to interpret and follow blueprints accurately. It does not involve extensive written or spoken communication, complex decision-making, or specialized knowledge that an LLM could significantly assist with. The task is primarily hands-on and relies on practical skills rather than information processing or analysis that an LLM could enhance. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM to reduce the time it takes to complete the task significantly.
