1: In this task, a Claims Adjuster, Examiner, or Investigator is required to examine titles to property to determine their validity and act as a company agent in transactions with property owners. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves analyzing legal documents, verifying information, and potentially engaging in negotiations with property owners. While an LLM could assist in providing general information on property titles and legal procedures, it may not have access to up-to-date property records or specific legal details required for accurate title examination. Additionally, the negotiation aspect of the task involves human interaction and judgment, which may not be effectively handled by the LLM alone. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it involves a high degree of human interaction, legal expertise, and decision-making that cannot be fully automated by the LLM.
