1: In this task, a Cardiovascular Technologist or Technician is required to monitor patients' blood pressure and heart rate using electrocardiogram (EKG) equipment during procedures. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves real-time monitoring of physiological parameters and notifying the physician of any abnormalities. While the LLM can provide information on cardiovascular procedures, it cannot physically monitor patients or operate EKG equipment. Therefore, the task cannot be significantly expedited or improved by the LLM alone. As a result, this task falls under E0 as it does not meet the criteria for exposure to LLM capabilities.

2: E0

3: High
