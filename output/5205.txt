1: In this task, the tutor is required to develop teaching or training materials, such as handouts, study materials, or quizzes. With access to the powerful OpenAI large language model (LLM), the tutor can easily generate a wide range of educational materials by leveraging the model's capabilities to write and transform text according to complex instructions. The LLM can assist in creating engaging and informative handouts, study materials, and quizzes tailored to the specific needs of the students. The model can also help in summarizing key concepts, generating questions for quizzes, and providing explanations for study materials. Overall, the LLM can significantly reduce the time and effort required to develop these teaching materials with high quality.
