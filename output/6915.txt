1: In this task, an animal trainer is required to feed, exercise, and provide general care for animals. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes for an animal trainer to complete this task with high quality. 

- E0: This task involves physical interaction with animals, such as feeding and exercising them, which cannot be replaced by text-based tools like the LLM. The LLM cannot physically care for animals or clean their holding areas.
- E1: While the LLM could potentially provide information on best practices for animal care or suggest exercise routines, the actual feeding, exercising, and cleaning tasks require physical presence and interaction, which the LLM cannot perform.
- E2: It is conceivable that software could be developed on top of the LLM to provide reminders for feeding schedules, generate care plans based on specific animal needs, or offer training tips. However, the core tasks of feeding, exercising, and cleaning would still require physical effort from the animal trainer.
- E3: The task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images, so the image capabilities of the LLM are not relevant here.
