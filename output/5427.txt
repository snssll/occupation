1: In this task, a Survey Researcher is responsible for overseeing the work of staff members involved in conducting surveys. This involves tasks such as managing survey support staff and interviewers, ensuring data collection is done accurately, and reviewing the collected survey data. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be significantly aided by the LLM in terms of providing guidance on managing staff, improving data collection methods, or analyzing survey data efficiently.

- E1: If the LLM can provide detailed instructions on how to effectively manage survey support staff, give guidance on improving survey data collection techniques, or offer insights on analyzing survey data, then the task could be completed more efficiently with equivalent quality by using the LLM. This would involve writing and transforming text to provide instructions or feedback to staff members, which aligns with the capabilities of the LLM.
- E2: While the LLM alone may not reduce the time it takes to complete the task by half, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to create tools for managing survey staff, optimizing data collection processes, or analyzing survey data more effectively. These tools could leverage the LLM's capabilities to provide recommendations, analyze information, or prepare training materials based on specialized knowledge.
- E3: Since the task does not involve image processing or detailed visual analysis, and the primary focus is on managing staff and survey data, the image capabilities of the LLM are not directly relevant to this task.
