1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of cleaning semiconductor wafers as a Semiconductor Processing Technician, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be impacted by the use of a large language model (LLM).

- The task of cleaning semiconductor wafers involves following specific procedures and protocols to ensure the wafers are free from contaminants. This task is primarily hands-on and requires physical interaction with equipment.
- While an LLM could potentially provide information on semiconductor cleaning processes or guidelines, the actual cleaning process itself cannot be automated or significantly assisted by text-based instructions.
- The task does not involve complex decision-making, analysis of large amounts of data, or specialized domain knowledge that would greatly benefit from an LLM's capabilities.
- The task is practical and technical, focusing on manual labor rather than information processing or decision-making.

Based on these considerations, the task of cleaning semiconductor wafers as a Semiconductor Processing Technician would be classified as E0 - No exposure to LLM.

2: E0
