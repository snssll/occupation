1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of holding regular meetings with each assigned unit as a Residential Advisor, we need to consider how the task can be completed with the help of an LLM. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The task involves communication and coordination with residents, which can benefit from the LLM's ability to generate written content, provide feedback on documents, and maintain records of written data. The LLM can assist in drafting meeting agendas, summarizing discussions, and documenting action items from the meetings, ultimately reducing the time and effort required to organize and conduct these meetings effectively.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time it takes to hold regular meetings, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to streamline the process. For example, an application could be created to schedule meetings, generate meeting summaries automatically, and provide recommendations based on past meeting data. This additional software could enhance the efficiency of the task.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not relevant for the task of holding regular meetings with assigned units as it primarily involves written communication and interaction with residents. Therefore, this task does not benefit from image capabilities provided by the LLM.

Based on the above analysis, the task of holding regular meetings with each assigned unit as a Residential Advisor is best classified as E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications.
