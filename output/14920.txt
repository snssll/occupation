1: In this task, a Costume Attendant is responsible for returning borrowed or rented items when productions are complete and returning other items to storage. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone or with additional software could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality.

- Direct exposure (E1): The task involves straightforward instructions that can be easily understood and completed by a human without the need for complex language processing or generation. The task does not require extensive research, analysis, or decision-making that would benefit significantly from the LLM's capabilities. Therefore, direct access to the LLM is unlikely to reduce the time it takes to complete this task by at least half.

- Exposure by LLM-powered applications (E2): While it is conceivable that software could be developed to track borrowed or rented items, manage inventory, and automate the process of returning items, the task itself is relatively simple and does not inherently require advanced language processing or generation. The potential software that could be developed on top of the LLM may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task by half.

- Exposure given image capabilities (E3): The task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images. Therefore, the image capabilities provided by the LLM are not relevant to this task.

Based on the analysis above, the task of returning borrowed or rented items and storing other items as a Costume Attendant is best classified as E0 - No exposure.

2: E0
