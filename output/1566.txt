1: In this task, the occupation involves setting up and operating machine tools for grinding, lapping, polishing, and buffing metal and plastic workpieces. The specific task mentioned is related to applying lubricating compounds on workpieces or directing coolant flow against tools and workpieces. To determine the exposure level, we need to consider if the task can be significantly enhanced by using the LLM. The task itself is straightforward and manual, requiring physical interaction with the workpieces and machinery. While the LLM can provide information on lubricants or coolants, it cannot physically apply them. Therefore, the task does not involve complex instructions, writing, summarizing, or data analysis that would benefit significantly from LLM assistance. As a result, this task falls under E0 as it does not clearly decrease the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete it with high quality by at least half.
