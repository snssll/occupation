1: In this task, the Gambling and Sports Book Writers and Runners are required to supervise staff and games, as well as mediate disputes. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if the task can be significantly aided by the use of the LLM. 

- The task involves supervising staff, which may require human interaction, observation, and decision-making based on real-time situations. This aspect of the task may not be easily automated or assisted by the LLM.
- Mediating disputes also involves understanding complex human interactions, emotions, and context, which may be challenging for the LLM to handle effectively without real-time input and nuanced understanding of the situation.

Considering the nature of the task and the limitations of the LLM in handling real-time human interactions and complex emotional situations, it is unlikely that the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with high quality. Therefore, this task is best classified as E0.

2: E0
