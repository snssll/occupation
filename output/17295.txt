1: In this task, the Orderlies Nursing Assistants are responsible for transporting patients to various areas within a healthcare facility. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task. Since the task involves physical movement of patients using equipment like wheelchairs, stretchers, or moveable beds, it is not something that can be directly assisted by the LLM. The LLM cannot physically move patients or operate equipment. Therefore, the task does not fall under E1, E2, or E3 categories as the LLM cannot perform the core function of patient transportation.
