1: Healthcare social workers play a crucial role in developing social policies and assisting in community development within the healthcare sector. To determine the appropriate exposure label for this task, we need to consider the nature of the task and how an LLM could assist in completing it. 

- E1: Direct exposure - An LLM could assist in researching and providing information on existing social policies, community development strategies, and best practices in healthcare settings. It could help in drafting policy recommendations, summarizing research findings, and generating reports to advise on social policy. The LLM could also assist in crafting communication materials to engage with community stakeholders.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While an LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time to complete this task, additional software built on top of the LLM could enhance its capabilities. For example, a specialized tool could be developed to analyze large datasets related to social policies and community development, providing insights and recommendations based on the data. This tool could integrate with the LLM to generate policy briefs or community development plans more efficiently.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities would not significantly impact the completion of this task as it primarily involves policy development and community engagement, which are text-based activities. The task does not require image analysis or creation.

Based on the above analysis, the task of developing or advising on social policy and assisting in community development aligns most closely with E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications.
