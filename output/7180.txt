1: In this task, a Patternmaker, Wood is required to glue fillets along interior angles of patterns. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task and the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves physical manipulation of materials (gluing fillets) along with understanding and working with wood patterns. The task does not involve text input or output, complex instructions, data analysis, or any form of communication that can be directly assisted by the LLM. As the task is hands-on and requires physical dexterity, it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM, which is primarily text-based and lacks physical interaction abilities. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not benefit from LLM assistance.

2: E0
