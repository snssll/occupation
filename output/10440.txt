1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of observing and interviewing workers as an Industrial-Organizational Psychologist, we need to consider how the LLM can assist in completing this task. 

- The task involves gathering information through observations and interviews, which are primarily human interaction-based activities. The LLM can potentially assist in generating interview questions or providing guidance on conducting interviews effectively.
- The LLM can help in summarizing information obtained from interviews or observations, which can save time in analyzing and synthesizing data.
- The LLM can aid in preparing reports based on the gathered information, helping in documenting findings and recommendations.

Considering these points, the task can benefit from the LLM's capabilities in generating questions, summarizing information, and preparing reports, which can streamline the data collection and analysis process.
