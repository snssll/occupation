1: In this task of performing autopsies to determine causes of deaths, the primary responsibility involves conducting post-mortem examinations to identify the cause of death. This task requires hands-on work, precise measurements, and detailed visual analysis, which are not tasks that can be effectively performed by an LLM. The LLM does not have the capability to physically examine a body, take samples, or analyze them in a laboratory setting. Additionally, the task involves a high degree of human interaction and expertise in pathology, which cannot be replaced by an LLM. Therefore, this task falls under the E0 category as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM or any tools built on top of it.
