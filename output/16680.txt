1: In this task, a Stationary Engineer or Boiler Operator is required to switch from automatic to manual controls and isolate equipment mechanically and electrically to allow for safe inspection and repair work. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves technical knowledge and expertise in operating and maintaining equipment.
- The task requires understanding safety protocols and procedures to ensure safe inspection and repair work.
- The task involves following specific steps to switch controls and isolate equipment, which can be guided by written instructions or standard operating procedures.

Given these considerations, the task does not involve complex text transformation, summarization, or specialized domain knowledge retrieval that would significantly benefit from direct access to an LLM. While an LLM could potentially provide general information on safety procedures or equipment operation, the task itself does not heavily rely on text-based information processing that would be significantly expedited by LLM access.
