1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of serving on policy-making committees, assisting in community development, and lobbying for solutions to problems as a Child, Family, and School Social Worker, we need to consider the nature of the task and how LLM exposure could impact it:

- Writing and transforming text: The task involves engaging in written communication, which could potentially benefit from LLM assistance in drafting policy proposals, community development plans, and lobbying materials.
- Providing feedback on documents: LLM could assist in reviewing and providing feedback on policy documents, community development plans, and lobbying materials.
- Analyzing written information to inform decisions: LLM could help in analyzing data and information related to policy issues, community needs, and effective lobbying strategies.

Considering these points, the task could benefit from LLM assistance in generating written content, providing feedback, and analyzing information, which aligns with E1 exposure.
