1: In this task, a Wind Turbine Service Technician is required to test structures, controls, or mechanical, hydraulic, or electrical systems according to test plans or in coordination with engineers. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone or with additional software could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task.

- E0: This task involves hands-on testing of physical structures and systems, which cannot be directly replaced by the LLM or any software tool. The task also requires coordination with engineers, which involves human interaction and practical skills that cannot be replicated by the LLM.

- E1: The LLM could potentially assist in generating test plans, documenting test results, or providing theoretical knowledge related to wind turbine systems. However, the core aspect of physically testing structures and systems cannot be automated by the LLM alone.

- E2: While the LLM could potentially assist in providing information on wind turbine systems, it is unlikely that additional software built on top of the LLM could significantly reduce the time it takes to physically test structures and systems in coordination with engineers.

- E3: The task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images, so the image capabilities of the LLM are not relevant to this task.

2: E0

3: High
