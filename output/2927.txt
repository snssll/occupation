1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of conducting initial meetings with disputants as an Arbitrator, Mediator, or Conciliator, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be impacted by the use of the LLM.

- The task involves conducting initial meetings with disputants to outline the arbitration process, settle procedural matters, and determine details such as witness numbers or time requirements. This task primarily involves communication, negotiation, and procedural understanding.
- The LLM can assist in providing guidance on standard arbitration processes, suggesting common procedural matters that need to be settled, and offering potential questions to ask disputants. It can also help in drafting communication materials or scripts for initial meetings.
- However, the task of conducting initial meetings with disputants requires a high level of human interaction, empathy, and adaptability, which are not easily replaceable by the LLM. The nuances of negotiation, understanding non-verbal cues, and building rapport are crucial aspects of this task that the LLM may not be able to fully replicate.
