1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of performing emergency roadside repairs as a Heavy and Tractor-Trailer Truck Driver, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be impacted by the use of the LLM.

- This task involves practical, hands-on skills such as changing tires, installing light bulbs, tire chains, or spark plugs. These activities require physical dexterity and knowledge of automotive mechanics.
- The LLM, being a text-based model, cannot directly assist in performing physical tasks like changing tires or installing parts on a vehicle.
- While the LLM could potentially provide information on how to perform these repairs through text instructions, it cannot physically execute the repairs itself.
- The task does not involve complex decision-making or specialized domain knowledge that would significantly benefit from the LLM's capabilities.

Based on these considerations, the task of performing emergency roadside repairs as a Heavy and Tractor-Trailer Truck Driver would be classified as E0 - No exposure.
