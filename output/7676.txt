1: In this task, a physical therapist is required to inform patients and refer them to appropriate practitioners when the diagnosis reveals findings outside the scope of physical therapy. To complete this task, the physical therapist needs to have a good understanding of medical conditions, treatment options, and healthcare providers in various specialties. The task involves communication skills, medical knowledge, and the ability to make appropriate referrals based on the patient's condition.

To determine the exposure level, we need to consider if access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes for a physical therapist to inform patients and refer them to appropriate practitioners. While the LLM can provide general information on medical conditions and treatment options, it may not have access to up-to-date medical knowledge or specific details about healthcare providers in different specialties. The task also involves human interaction and decision-making based on individual patient cases, which may not be suitable for automation by the LLM.
