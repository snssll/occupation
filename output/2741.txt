1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of computing and comparing costs of services for Sales Representatives of Services, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be aided by the LLM. 

- E0: This task involves computation and comparison of costs, which may not significantly benefit from the use of an LLM. The task is straightforward and does not involve complex decision-making or specialized knowledge that would require LLM assistance.

- E1: While the LLM could potentially assist in providing information on general pricing trends or industry insights related to services, the task of computing and comparing costs itself does not inherently require the use of an LLM to complete efficiently. The task can likely be accomplished effectively without the need for LLM assistance.

- E2: It is conceivable that specialized software could be developed on top of the LLM to provide recommendations based on data analysis or market trends, which could aid Sales Representatives in making more informed cost comparisons. However, the task itself does not inherently require LLM capabilities to be completed in a timely manner.

- E3: The task of computing and comparing costs of services does not involve image processing or detailed visual analysis, so the additional image capabilities provided by the LLM would not significantly impact the completion of this task.

Based on the analysis above, the most fitting label for this task is E0.

2: E0

3: High
