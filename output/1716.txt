1: In this task, a First-Line Supervisor of Security Workers is required to call police or fire departments in cases of emergency, such as fire, bomb threats, and the presence of unauthorized persons. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it. 

- E0: This task involves direct human interaction and quick decision-making in emergency situations. It requires immediate action and cannot be fully automated or delegated to a machine due to the critical nature of the task. The LLM cannot physically make the call to emergency services or assess the situation on-site.

- E1: While the LLM could potentially draft a script or provide guidance on what information to convey when calling emergency services, the actual act of making the call and assessing the emergency situation requires human judgment and intervention. The LLM can assist in preparing for such situations but cannot directly replace the supervisor's role in handling emergencies.

- E2: It is conceivable that software could be developed to assist supervisors by providing real-time updates on emergency protocols, contact information for emergency services, or even analyzing the situation based on input data. However, the critical nature of emergency response and the need for immediate human intervention make it challenging to fully automate this task using the LLM alone.

- E3: The task does not involve image processing or detailed visual analysis, so the image capabilities of the LLM would not significantly impact the completion of this task.
