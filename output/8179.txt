1: In this task, the Automotive Glass Installer and Repairer installs replacement glass in vehicles. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality. 

- The task of installing replacement glass in vehicles involves physical work that cannot be directly performed by the LLM.
- The task requires hands-on skills, precision, and knowledge of automotive mechanics, which are beyond the capabilities of the LLM.
- The LLM cannot interact with physical objects or perform tasks that require physical manipulation.

Based on these considerations, it is clear that the task of installing replacement glass in vehicles falls under E0 as it involves physical work and cannot be significantly aided by the LLM alone.
