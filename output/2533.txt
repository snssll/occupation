1: In this task, a Residential Advisor is required to communicate with other staff to resolve problems with individual students. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves written communication to address issues related to student behavior or concerns. An LLM could assist in drafting emails, messages, or reports to communicate effectively with other staff members. The LLM could help in formulating responses, suggesting solutions, or providing language that is clear and professional. However, the task does not involve complex data analysis, specialized domain knowledge, or image processing. Therefore, while the LLM can aid in generating written content, it does not significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete the task, as the core aspect of the task involves human interaction and problem-solving skills beyond text generation.
