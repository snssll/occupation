1: For the task of reviewing work orders and specifications to determine materials needed and types of parts to be processed as a Coil Winder, Taper, or Finisher, we can consider the following:

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** The task involves reading and interpreting text (work orders and specifications) to extract specific information (materials needed, types of parts). An LLM could assist in summarizing the information, providing insights, or even generating a list of materials and parts based on the input. The LLM can help in transforming text and providing relevant information, potentially reducing the time needed to analyze work orders.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the task may not require highly specialized domain knowledge, having access to additional software that can summarize longer documents, retrieve up-to-date information on materials, or provide recommendations based on the specifications could further enhance the efficiency of completing this task. Such software could be developed on top of the LLM to streamline the process.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Image capabilities would not significantly impact the task of reviewing work orders and specifications, as it primarily involves text-based information rather than detailed visual content.
