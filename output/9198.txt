1: For the task of maintaining library equipment and instructing patrons on their proper use, the exposure to LLM can be evaluated as follows:

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** The task involves providing instructions and information related to library equipment, which can be effectively communicated through written text. The LLM can assist in generating detailed instructions, troubleshooting guides, or FAQs for different equipment. It can also help in drafting manuals or handouts for patrons on how to use the equipment correctly. Additionally, the LLM can aid in creating training materials or scripts for instructing patrons on the proper use of photocopiers, scanners, and computers.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the LLM can provide valuable assistance in generating written content related to equipment maintenance and usage instructions, there might be additional software applications that could be developed on top of the LLM to streamline the process further. For instance, an application could be designed to automatically generate maintenance schedules for library equipment based on input data, or to create interactive tutorials for patrons on how to use the equipment effectively.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** This task does not involve a significant reliance on image capabilities. While there may be some visual aids or diagrams involved in explaining equipment usage, the primary focus is on written instructions and verbal communication. Therefore, the image capabilities of the LLM would not play a crucial role in enhancing the completion of this task.
