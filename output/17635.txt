1: In this task, the Appraisers of Personal and Business Property need to verify that property matches legal descriptions or certifications. To complete this task, they would typically need to review legal documents, property descriptions, and certifications to ensure accuracy. With access to the powerful OpenAI large language model (LLM), the appraisers could potentially use the model to assist in cross-referencing legal descriptions, certifications, and property details to verify their accuracy more efficiently. The LLM could help in quickly searching for relevant information, clarifying complex legal language, and providing additional context on specific terms or regulations related to the property. Overall, the LLM could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task by providing quick access to relevant information and aiding in the verification process.
