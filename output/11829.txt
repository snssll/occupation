1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of placing products on carts or conveyors as a Food Batchmaker, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be impacted by the use of the LLM. In this case, the task involves a physical action of transferring products to the next stage of processing, which cannot be directly influenced by the LLM. The LLM cannot physically interact with objects or perform manual tasks. Therefore, the task does not involve any text input or output that the LLM can assist with. As a result, the task falls under E0 as it does not meet the criteria for exposure to LLM capabilities.
