1: In this task, a paperhanger is required to trim excess material at ceilings or baseboards using knives. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. This task involves physical work that requires precision and manual dexterity to ensure a clean finish. It does not involve text input or output, complex instructions, data analysis, or decision-making based on information processed by an LLM. The task is purely manual and does not involve any written or spoken communication that could be facilitated by an LLM. Therefore, this task does not align with any of the exposure levels in the rubric.
