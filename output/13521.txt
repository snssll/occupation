1: In this task, an Information Security Engineer is required to provide technical support to computer users for the installation and use of security products. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves providing technical support, which may require writing detailed instructions or responses to users' queries. This can be done efficiently by an LLM through text generation capabilities.
- The task does not involve complex visual analysis or physical interactions, making it suitable for automation using text-based tools.
- While the task may involve some level of specialized knowledge related to security products, the LLM can still assist in generating responses based on general security principles and guidelines.

Considering these points, the task can be significantly expedited with the use of an LLM, as it can help in generating detailed instructions, responses, and recommendations related to security products and technical support.
