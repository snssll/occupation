1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of creating tailored playlists by aligning music with event functions for Disc Jockeys, Except Radio, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it.

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** The task involves selecting music based on the type of event, which requires understanding the mood, atmosphere, and preferences of the audience. The LLM could assist in generating music recommendations based on event descriptions, themes, or specific requirements provided. It can help in suggesting songs that align with different types of events, such as weddings, parties, or corporate functions. The LLM's ability to process text input and provide tailored outputs makes it suitable for this task.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the LLM can generate music recommendations based on input descriptions, it may not have direct access to up-to-date music trends or specific event details unless provided in the input. Additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to integrate real-time music databases, event planning tools, or crowd-sourced event feedback to enhance the playlist creation process. This additional software could significantly improve the efficiency and accuracy of aligning music with event functions.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Image capabilities are not relevant for the task of creating tailored playlists for events. This task primarily involves text-based inputs related to event descriptions and music preferences, which can be effectively handled by the LLM without the need for image processing.
