1: In this task, the Fast Food and Counter Worker is responsible for arranging reservations for patrons of dining establishments. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task and the capabilities of the LLM. 

- The task involves arranging reservations, which is a straightforward administrative task that primarily involves communication and organization.
- The LLM can assist in generating written responses, drafting emails, or providing templates for reservation confirmations.
- The LLM can also help in maintaining records of reservations and customer details.
- However, the task does not involve complex decision-making, specialized domain knowledge, or detailed data analysis that would require advanced LLM capabilities.

Based on these considerations, the task of arranging reservations for patrons of dining establishments would likely fall under **E1 - Direct exposure**. The LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task by providing assistance with written communication and record-keeping.
