1: In this task of replacing damaged glass on vehicles as an Automotive Body and Related Repairer, the exposure to LLM can be evaluated as follows:

- E0: This task involves physical work that cannot be automated by the LLM. The actual replacement of glass on vehicles requires manual labor and precision that cannot be replicated by the LLM or any software tools.
- E1: The task does not involve writing, transforming text, providing edits, translating, summarizing documents, answering questions, or any other text-based activities that the LLM can significantly assist with. Therefore, direct access to the LLM would not reduce the time it takes to complete this task.
- E2: While it is conceivable that software could be developed to assist in providing guidance or instructions for replacing damaged glass on vehicles, the core task of physically replacing the glass cannot be automated by the LLM alone. The LLM could potentially be used to access repair manuals or guidelines, but the actual repair work is hands-on and cannot be done by the LLM.
- E3: The task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images. The task is focused on physical repair work on vehicles, which does not benefit from image capabilities.

Based on the above analysis, the task of replacing damaged glass on vehicles as an Automotive Body and Related Repairer would be classified as E0.
