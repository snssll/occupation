1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of investigating employee complaints and resolving problems as a First-Line Supervisor of Personal Service Workers, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be supported by the capabilities of the LLM. 

- The task involves reading and understanding employee complaints, applying management rules and regulations to address the issues, and providing resolutions. The LLM can assist in generating responses to complaints, providing guidance on relevant rules and regulations, and suggesting potential solutions based on general knowledge and best practices in management.

- The LLM can help in drafting responses to complaints, summarizing relevant rules and regulations, and offering recommendations for resolving common workplace issues. It can also assist in preparing training materials on conflict resolution and management practices.

- While the task may benefit from additional software that could streamline the process by summarizing complex regulations or providing specific case studies for reference, the core aspects of investigating complaints and resolving problems can be effectively supported by the LLM alone.

Based on these considerations, the task of investigating employee complaints and resolving problems as a First-Line Supervisor of Personal Service Workers is best classified as E1 - Direct exposure.
