1: In this task, a Loss Prevention Manager is required to coordinate theft and fraud investigations involving career criminals or organized group activities. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM can assist in completing it. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM can help in writing reports, analyzing data related to theft and fraud, providing insights on criminal behavior, and suggesting strategies for investigations. It can also assist in drafting communication to stakeholders involved in the investigations. However, the LLM may not have real-time access to specific criminal activities or ongoing investigations, limiting its ability to provide up-to-date information on career criminals or organized group activities without recent data input.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM can aid in generating reports, analyzing data, and providing general insights, additional software could be developed to enhance its capabilities. This software could potentially retrieve up-to-date information from various sources, including criminal databases or law enforcement reports, to assist in investigations involving career criminals or organized groups. Such a tool could significantly reduce the time required to gather relevant information and insights for the investigations.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Since this task primarily involves coordinating investigations and analyzing data related to theft and fraud, image capabilities may not be directly relevant. The task does not require detailed image analysis or creation, making it less likely to benefit significantly from image-related tools.
