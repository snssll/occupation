1: For the task of helping customers find the location of products as a cashier, the exposure to LLM can be analyzed as follows:

- E1: Direct exposure - The task involves providing information to customers, which can be done through written or spoken communication. The LLM can assist in generating responses or instructions on where products are located in the store, potentially reducing the time it takes to assist customers effectively.
- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While there may not be a specific application developed on top of the LLM for this task, it is conceivable that a specialized tool could be created to streamline the process of locating products for customers, integrating real-time inventory data or store layouts to provide accurate information efficiently.
- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not relevant for this task as it primarily involves verbal or written communication to guide customers to product locations.

Considering the above points, the task of helping customers find the location of products as a cashier could be best classified as E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications.
