1: In this task, the laborer is required to stack cargo in specific locations using pallets or cargo boards as directed. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be significantly expedited or improved by using the language model. Since the task involves physical labor and manual handling of cargo, it does not directly involve text input or output that the LLM can assist with. The task does not involve complex instructions, writing, summarizing, analyzing text, or any other text-based activities that the LLM excels at. Therefore, the task does not align with any of the exposure levels E1, E2, or E3.

2: E0

3: High
