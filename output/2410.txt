1: In this task, a teaching assistant is responsible for collecting money from students for school-related projects. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if the task can be significantly expedited or improved by using the LLM. Collecting money involves interacting with students, handling physical currency, and ensuring accurate record-keeping. The task does not involve complex text processing, data analysis, or decision-making that could be enhanced by the LLM. The LLM cannot physically collect money or interact with students in person, so its utility in this task is limited to providing general advice or templates for collecting money, which may not significantly reduce the time or effort required to complete the task.
