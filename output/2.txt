1: In this task, the Gambling Change Persons and Booth Cashiers are responsible for accepting credit applications and verifying credit references to provide check-cashing authorization or establish house credit accounts. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task and how an LLM could assist in completing it. 

- E0: This task involves verifying credit references and making decisions based on credit applications, which may require human judgment, especially when dealing with sensitive financial information. The task also involves assessing the creditworthiness of individuals, which may involve legal considerations and potential risks. An LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task, as it requires a level of expertise and discretion that goes beyond text-based processing.

- E1: While an LLM could potentially assist in generating standard responses or templates for credit verification processes, the core of this task involves complex decision-making based on financial information and credit references. The task also involves interacting with customers and assessing their creditworthiness, which may require human judgment and discretion. Therefore, the direct access to an LLM may not reduce the time significantly for completing this task with equivalent quality.

- E2: It is conceivable that additional software could be developed on top of an LLM to streamline the credit verification process by automatically retrieving and analyzing credit references, cross-referencing data, and providing recommendations based on financial information. This software could potentially reduce the time it takes to complete the task by half by automating certain aspects of credit verification and decision-making.

- E3: The task does not involve image processing or visual data, so the image capabilities of an LLM would not significantly impact the completion of this task.
