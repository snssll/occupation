1: In this task, a Gambling Change Person and Booth Cashier is responsible for accepting credit applications and verifying credit references to provide check-cashing authorization or establish house credit accounts. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- E0: This task involves verifying credit references and making decisions based on credit applications, which requires human judgment and decision-making. The task also involves handling sensitive financial information and assessing creditworthiness, which may involve legal implications. As such, this task is unlikely to be significantly impacted by the use of an LLM or LLM-powered tools.

- E1: While an LLM could potentially assist in drafting responses to credit applications or providing information on credit verification processes, the core aspect of verifying credit references and making decisions based on credit applications involves complex judgment and legal considerations that go beyond the capabilities of an LLM. Therefore, the use of an LLM would not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality.

- E2: It is conceivable that additional software could be developed on top of an LLM to assist with summarizing credit applications, retrieving up-to-date financial information, or providing recommendations based on credit references. However, the task of verifying credit references and making decisions based on credit applications still heavily relies on human judgment and expertise, making it unlikely that an LLM-powered tool alone would reduce the time to complete the task by half.

- E3: The task does not involve image processing or analysis, so the use of image capabilities alongside an LLM would not significantly impact the completion of the task.
