1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of performing fluorescein angiography of the eye as an Ophthalmic Medical Technologist, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves a specialized medical procedure that requires hands-on skills and precise measurements, which are not within the capabilities of the LLM. The LLM cannot physically perform medical procedures or interact with patients. Additionally, the task involves using medical equipment and expertise that are beyond the scope of text-based interactions that the LLM can handle. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it cannot be significantly aided by the LLM.
