1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of informing farmers or farm managers of crop progress as a Farmworker or Laborer in Crop, Nursery, and Greenhouse, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. In this case, the task involves providing updates on crop progress, which can be done through written communication. The LLM can assist in generating written reports, summaries, or updates on crop status based on the information provided. The LLM can also help in crafting emails or messages to convey this information effectively. Since the task primarily involves written communication and reporting, the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality. Therefore, this task falls under label E1 - Direct exposure.
