1: In this task of analyzing gunshot residue and bullet paths to determine how shootings occurred, the Forensic Science Technicians would typically rely on their expertise in forensic science, ballistics, and crime scene investigation. The task involves examining physical evidence, conducting tests, and interpreting the results to reconstruct the events of a shooting. While an LLM could potentially assist in providing general information on forensic science principles or ballistics, the task itself requires hands-on analysis of physical evidence and specialized knowledge that goes beyond what a text-based model can provide. The LLM cannot physically examine the residue or bullet paths, which are crucial for this analysis. Therefore, the task does not significantly benefit from LLM exposure in terms of reducing the time it takes to complete the task with high quality.
