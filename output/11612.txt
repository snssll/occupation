1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of performing predesign services such as feasibility or environmental impact studies as an Architect, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be completed with the help of an LLM.

- Feasibility studies involve analyzing various factors to determine the practicality of a project. This can involve researching regulations, costs, and potential obstacles.
- Environmental impact studies assess the potential effects of a project on the environment, considering factors like air quality, water resources, and wildlife habitats.

Given that an LLM can assist in researching regulations, providing information on costs, and summarizing data related to feasibility studies, as well as offering insights on environmental impact assessments based on existing knowledge, the task could benefit from the LLM's capabilities. The LLM can help in summarizing information, providing recommendations, and analyzing data to inform decisions related to these studies.
