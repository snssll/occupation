- Direct exposure (E1): Direct access to the LLM could potentially help in generating ideas for setting goals and deadlines by providing insights, suggestions, and examples based on existing data and best practices. The LLM could assist in drafting specific and measurable goals, as well as realistic deadlines. It could also help in considering various factors that might impact goal achievement. Overall, the LLM could streamline the brainstorming and planning process, potentially reducing the time needed to set goals and deadlines.
