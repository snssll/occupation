1: In this task of issuing landing and take-off authorizations or instructions, the primary requirement is to communicate effectively and ensure the safe and efficient movement of aircraft. While an LLM could potentially assist in generating standardized authorization templates or providing guidance on common scenarios, the task itself involves real-time decision-making based on dynamic factors such as weather conditions, air traffic volume, and aircraft types. The task also requires immediate responses and coordination with multiple parties, which may not be suitable for automation by an LLM. Therefore, the task falls under E0 as it involves critical decision-making, real-time communication, and human judgment that cannot be fully replaced by an LLM.
