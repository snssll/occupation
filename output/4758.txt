1: Special Education Teachers, whether in secondary school or middle school, often need to develop and implement strategies to meet the diverse needs of students with various handicapping conditions. This task involves creating individualized education plans, adapting curriculum materials, providing accommodations, and collaborating with other professionals to support students with disabilities. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone or with additional software could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task.

- E0: This task involves a high degree of human interaction, specialized knowledge, and decision-making based on individual student needs. While the LLM could potentially provide general information on teaching strategies or special education practices, the nuanced and individualized nature of this task requires human expertise and judgment. Therefore, the use of the LLM or LLM-powered tools would not significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced special education teacher to complete this task.

- E1: While the LLM could provide general information on teaching strategies or special education practices, the task of developing and implementing strategies for students with handicapping conditions is highly specialized and requires expertise in special education. The LLM could assist in providing background information or generating ideas, but the core of the task involves personalized, hands-on intervention that cannot be fully automated by the LLM.

- E2: It is conceivable that additional software built on top of the LLM could assist special education teachers in summarizing research articles, generating lesson plan ideas, or providing data analysis to inform decision-making. However, the complex and individualized nature of developing strategies for students with handicapping conditions may still heavily rely on human judgment and expertise. While some aspects of the task could be supported by LLM-powered applications, the overall reduction in time may not be significant enough to warrant an E1 label.

- E3: The task of developing and implementing strategies for students with handicapping conditions does not involve image processing or detailed visual analysis. Therefore, the inclusion of image capabilities would not significantly impact the completion time of this task.
