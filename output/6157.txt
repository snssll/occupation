1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of entering information into computerized court calendar, filing, or case management systems as a Judicial Law Clerk, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The task involves inputting text-based information into computer systems, which can be easily done using the LLM's text input and output capabilities. The LLM can assist in accurately entering data into these systems based on the provided information.
- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the task may not be significantly enhanced by additional software beyond the LLM itself, it is conceivable that specialized software could be developed to streamline the process of entering information into court systems, potentially reducing the time required.
- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Since the task primarily involves text-based data entry into computer systems, image capabilities are not directly relevant in this context.

Based on the above analysis, the task of entering information into computerized court systems as a Judicial Law Clerk would likely fall under E1: Direct exposure.
