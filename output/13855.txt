1: For the task of receiving payment as a cashier, the exposure to LLM can be analyzed as follows:

- E1: Direct exposure - The task of receiving payment involves a straightforward process that does not require complex instructions or specialized knowledge beyond basic cashiering skills. The LLM could potentially assist in providing guidance on handling different payment methods or scenarios, but the task itself is simple and does not involve extensive text transformation or analysis.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While there could be software developed on top of the LLM that could potentially streamline cashiering processes or provide additional support, such as integrating with payment systems or offering real-time transaction analysis, the core task of receiving payments does not inherently require advanced LLM capabilities beyond basic text understanding.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities would not significantly impact the task of receiving payment as a cashier, as it primarily involves text-based interactions with customers and handling various payment methods. Image processing or creation is not relevant to this task.

Based on the analysis, the task of receiving payment as a cashier is best classified as E0, as it does not clearly benefit from LLM capabilities in a way that would significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete the task.
