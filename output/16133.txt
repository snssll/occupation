1: In this task, a Tile and Stone Setter is required to spread mastic or adhesive base on a roof deck using a serrated spreader to form a base for promenade tile. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves a physical action of spreading adhesive on a roof deck, which cannot be directly performed by an LLM or any software tool. This task requires manual labor, physical coordination, and an understanding of construction materials and techniques, which are beyond the capabilities of the LLM. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not involve text-based work that can be significantly aided by the LLM.
