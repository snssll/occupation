1: In this task, a Hydroelectric Plant Technician is required to erect scaffolds, platforms, or hoisting frames to access machinery or infrastructure for repair or replacement at a hydroelectric plant. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. This task involves physical work that cannot be directly assisted by an LLM. The task requires hands-on skills, knowledge of safety protocols, and physical labor to set up the necessary structures for maintenance work. Since the task involves physical actions and does not primarily rely on text-based information processing, it falls under E0 as it cannot be significantly aided by an LLM.
