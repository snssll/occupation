1: In this task, a farmworker is required to clean work areas, maintain grounds, and landscaping. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes for a worker to complete this task with high quality. 

- The task of cleaning work areas and maintaining grounds is physical in nature and requires manual labor. The LLM cannot physically clean or maintain the grounds.
- While the LLM could potentially provide information or guidance on effective cleaning techniques or landscaping ideas, the actual execution of the task still requires physical effort.
- The task does not involve complex text input or output that the LLM could significantly assist with.
- There are no specialized domain knowledge or up-to-date facts required for this task that the LLM could provide.

Based on these considerations, it is clear that the task of cleaning work areas and maintaining grounds in this occupation does not benefit from exposure to the LLM in a way that would significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task.
