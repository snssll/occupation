1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of analyzing log files or other digital information to identify perpetrators of network intrusions as a Digital Forensics Analyst, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. In this task, the LLM could potentially assist in analyzing the text-based log files, identifying patterns, suggesting potential leads, and even providing insights based on existing knowledge of cyber threats and intrusion techniques. The LLM could help in summarizing the information, generating hypotheses, and possibly even recommending next steps based on the analysis of the digital information. However, the task also requires specialized domain knowledge in digital forensics, understanding of cybersecurity principles, and familiarity with various tools and techniques used in the field. While the LLM can provide some support in the analysis process, it may not significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced Digital Forensics Analyst to complete the task with high quality. Therefore, this task falls under label E2, as additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to enhance the analysis process and potentially reduce the time needed to complete the task.
