1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of developing, maintaining, and teaching online courses as a History Teacher, Postsecondary, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM can assist in writing and transforming text, providing edits to existing text, summarizing documents, and generating questions. In this task, the LLM can help in creating course content, providing feedback on course materials, and potentially generating questions for assessments. However, the task also involves structuring the course, designing assessments, and interacting with students, which may not be fully covered by the LLM alone.
  
- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM can assist in content creation and feedback, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to automate tasks like course structuring, assessment design, and student interaction. This software could potentially reduce the time it takes to complete the task by half by providing more specialized functionalities tailored to online course development and teaching.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not directly relevant to the task of developing, maintaining, and teaching online courses as a History Teacher, Postsecondary. The task primarily involves text-based content creation and interaction with students, which do not heavily rely on image processing.

Based on the above analysis, the task of developing, maintaining, and teaching online courses as a History Teacher, Postsecondary, aligns best with the E2 label. While the LLM can assist in certain aspects of the task, additional software leveraging the LLM's capabilities could significantly enhance efficiency in completing the task.
