1: In this task of grading homework and tests for teaching assistants, the main activities involve evaluating student responses, assigning scores, and recording the results. With the help of a large language model (LLM), the process of grading can be significantly expedited. The LLM can assist in providing model answers, identifying common mistakes, and even automating the grading process to some extent. This would involve transforming text (student responses) and providing edits to existing text (grading criteria). The LLM can also help in maintaining records of the grades and feedback provided to students. Overall, the LLM can streamline the grading process and reduce the time required for this task.
