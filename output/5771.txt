1: In this task, the Fast Food and Counter Worker is responsible for distributing food to servers. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality. Distributing food to servers is a physical task that involves handling and moving physical objects, which cannot be directly performed by the LLM. The LLM cannot physically distribute food items. Therefore, there is no way for the LLM to directly assist in completing this task. As a result, this task falls under E0 as it does not meet the criteria for exposure to LLM capabilities.

2: E0

3: High
