1: In this task, a boilermaker is required to shape or fabricate parts using heavy-metalworking machines to adapt pressure vessels, heat exchangers, or piping to premises. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. This task involves physical work with heavy-metalworking machines, which cannot be directly replaced by the capabilities of an LLM. The task requires hands-on skills, precision, and knowledge of metalworking techniques, which are not within the scope of what an LLM can do. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM or any tools built on top of it.

2: E0

3: High
