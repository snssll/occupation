1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of arranging screen tests or auditions for prospective performers as a Talent Director, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be aided by the use of a large language model (LLM).

- E1: Direct exposure - In this case, the LLM could assist in drafting emails to invite performers for auditions, scheduling the screen tests, or providing templates for audition scripts. The LLM could also help in summarizing performer profiles or generating questions to ask during auditions. Overall, the LLM could significantly reduce the time needed to organize and plan auditions efficiently.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone can streamline certain aspects of the task, additional software could be developed to further enhance the process. For example, an application could be created to analyze performer profiles and suggest suitable candidates for auditions based on specific criteria. This additional software could provide more advanced recommendations and insights, ultimately improving the efficiency of the audition process.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities would not have a significant impact on the task of arranging screen tests or auditions for performers. This task primarily involves communication, organization, and coordination, which can be effectively supported by text-based interactions with the LLM.

Based on the above analysis, the task of arranging screen tests or auditions for prospective performers as a Talent Director would likely fall under E1: Direct exposure.
