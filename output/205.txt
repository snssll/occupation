1: In this task, a Physical Therapist Aide administers various therapeutic treatments to patients, such as manual exercises, massages, and modalities like ultrasound. The task involves hands-on physical interaction with patients, which cannot be performed by an LLM or any software tool. The task also requires the aide to assess the patient's response to the treatment and make adjustments accordingly, which involves real-time observation and decision-making based on physical cues. Since the task is highly reliant on physical interaction and real-time assessment, it falls under E0 as it cannot be significantly aided by the LLM or any software tool.
