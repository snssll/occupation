1: In this task, a Switchboard Operator is required to perform various cash handling tasks, such as collecting payments, making bank deposits, or managing petty cash. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task and how an LLM could potentially assist in completing it. 

- E0: This task involves physical cash handling, which cannot be automated by an LLM. The task also requires in-person interactions and precise financial transactions, making it unsuitable for automation by the LLM.
- E1: While the LLM could potentially provide information or guidance on cash handling procedures, it cannot directly handle physical cash or perform financial transactions. Therefore, the LLM's assistance would not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task.
- E2: Developing software on top of the LLM that could automate cash handling tasks would be complex and may not be feasible due to the physical nature of the task and the need for security measures. Therefore, the LLM alone would not be able to reduce the time significantly.
- E3: The task does not involve image processing or visual information that would benefit from additional capabilities beyond text-based processing. Therefore, exposure to image capabilities would not significantly impact the completion of this task.
