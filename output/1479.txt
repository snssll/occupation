1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of auditioning for dance roles or membership in dance companies in relation to exposure to LLM, we need to consider the nature of the task. This task involves a physical performance aspect where dancers showcase their skills, technique, and artistry in person. The audition process typically involves live demonstrations of dance routines, improvisation, and interaction with judges or directors. Since this task requires physical presence, real-time performance, and human judgment of artistic expression, it does not align with the capabilities of an LLM. The LLM cannot physically perform dance routines, interact in real-time, or make judgments based on physical performance. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not benefit from LLM capabilities in reducing time or improving quality.
