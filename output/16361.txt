1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of studying documentation for new scientific or technical products as a Sales Representative for Wholesale and Manufacturing, Technical and Scientific Products, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could assist in completing it.

- E1: Direct exposure - If the task involves reading and summarizing documentation, providing feedback, or generating questions about the products, the LLM could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete these tasks with equivalent quality. The LLM can help in processing and understanding technical information quickly, making it easier for the sales representative to grasp key details.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not reduce the time by half for this task, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to summarize lengthy technical documents, retrieve up-to-date information about products, or provide recommendations based on the data analyzed. Such software could enhance the efficiency of studying new products.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Since the task involves studying documentation, image capabilities may not be directly relevant unless the documentation includes diagrams or visual aids that could be processed by an image system. However, for text-based documents, image capabilities may not significantly impact the completion time of the task.
