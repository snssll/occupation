1: In this task, a Bus and Truck Mechanic and Diesel Engine Specialist is required to raise trucks, buses, and heavy parts or equipment using hydraulic jacks or hoists. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if access to the LLM or LLM-powered tools can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality. Since this task involves physical labor and hands-on work with heavy machinery, it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM or any tools built on top of it. The task requires manual dexterity, physical strength, and knowledge of mechanical systems, which cannot be replaced by text-based AI models. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not benefit from LLM exposure.
