1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of informing website users of problems, resolutions, changes, and updates as a Web Administrator, we need to consider the nature of the task and how an LLM could assist in completing it. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The task involves communicating with users through written text, which is a task well-suited for an LLM. The LLM can help in drafting informative messages, announcements, and updates to be shared on the website. The LLM can also assist in responding to user queries or feedback. Overall, the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to craft these communications with equivalent quality.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the task can benefit from the LLM's text generation capabilities, there may be additional software that could be developed on top of the LLM to streamline the process further. For example, an application that can analyze user feedback data and generate tailored responses automatically could enhance efficiency. However, the task itself can still be effectively completed with the current capabilities of the LLM.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not directly relevant to the task of informing website users of problems, resolutions, changes, and updates. The task primarily involves written communication and does not require image processing.

Based on the above analysis, the task of informing website users of problems, resolutions, changes, and updates as a Web Administrator aligns most closely with E1: Direct exposure.
