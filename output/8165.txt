1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of installing partially overlapping layers of material over roof insulation surfaces as a roofer, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. In this task, the roofer needs to follow specific instructions, use tools like chalk lines and shingling hatchets, and ensure precise installation of materials. The task involves manual work and requires physical interaction with the roof surface. The LLM, even with additional software, cannot physically install materials or interact with physical tools. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not involve writing, transforming text, or utilizing the LLM's capabilities to complete the task.

2: E0
