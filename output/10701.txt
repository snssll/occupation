1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of operating audio and video systems as a Flight Attendant, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves managing audio and video equipment on an aircraft, which typically requires physical interaction with the systems. The LLM does not have the ability to physically interact with equipment or perform tasks that require hands-on manipulation. While the LLM can provide information on how to operate audio and video systems through text instructions, it cannot directly operate the systems itself. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not involve written or spoken communication that the LLM can assist with.
