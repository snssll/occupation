1: In this task, a roofer is required to cut materials like felt, shingles, or strips of flashing to fit specific angles formed by walls, vents, or intersecting roof surfaces. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if the task can be significantly expedited or improved by using the LLM. 

- The task of cutting materials to fit specific angles is a physical task that requires manual labor and precision. It involves working with physical materials and tools, which cannot be directly replaced by text-based instructions or responses from the LLM.
- While the LLM could potentially provide theoretical information or guidance on cutting angles, it cannot physically perform the task of cutting materials.
- Additionally, the task involves practical skills and expertise in roofing, which are not solely based on text-based information that the LLM can provide.
