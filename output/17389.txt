1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of troubleshooting technical issues related to MRI scanners as a Magnetic Resonance Imaging Technologist, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. In this case, the task involves diagnosing and resolving technical problems with MRI equipment, which requires specialized knowledge and hands-on skills. While the LLM can provide general information about MRI technology and troubleshooting steps, it cannot physically interact with the equipment or perform diagnostic tests.

Given that the task involves practical troubleshooting of complex machinery, it falls under the category of tasks that require hands-on expertise and cannot be fully automated or significantly expedited by the LLM. The LLM may provide some general guidance or information, but the core of the task still relies heavily on the technician's specialized training and experience.
