1: For the task of demonstrating database technical functionality, such as performance, security, and reliability, the most relevant exposure label from the rubric would be E2 - Exposure by LLM-powered applications. While the LLM itself may not directly reduce the time it takes to demonstrate these technical functionalities, it is easy to imagine additional software that could be developed on top of the LLM to assist in this task. This software could potentially analyze data, provide recommendations based on the information provided, and help in preparing training materials based on specialized knowledge related to database functionality.

2: E2

3: Moderate
