1: In this task, a Loss Prevention Manager is responsible for performing cash audits and deposit investigations to ensure that store cash is fully accounted for. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it more efficiently.

- E0: This task involves physical actions such as handling cash, conducting audits, and investigating deposits. It also requires a high level of human judgment and interaction, as well as adherence to specific protocols and regulations. The task does not involve text-based activities that could be significantly expedited by the LLM.

- E1: While the LLM could potentially assist in generating reports, summarizing findings, or providing templates for audit documentation, the core activities of performing cash audits and deposit investigations involve physical verification and analysis that cannot be fully automated by the LLM. The LLM may help with some aspects of the task, but it would not reduce the time it takes to complete the task by at least half.

- E2: It is conceivable that specialized software could be developed on top of the LLM to streamline certain aspects of the task, such as automatically extracting relevant information from audit reports or analyzing trends in cash discrepancies. However, the complexity of the task and the need for hands-on verification suggest that the LLM alone would not significantly expedite the process.

- E3: The task does not involve image processing or visual analysis that would benefit from additional capabilities beyond text-based assistance. Therefore, exposure to image capabilities would not have a significant impact on completing this task.
