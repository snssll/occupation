1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of setting up and conducting chemical experiments as a Chemical Technician, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves practical laboratory work that requires hands-on skills and knowledge of scientific procedures. While the LLM can provide information on theoretical aspects of chemistry and possibly assist in designing experiments through text input, it cannot physically conduct experiments or perform the necessary techniques like chromatography, spectroscopy, or microscopy. The task also involves a high degree of human interaction and precise measurements, which are not within the capabilities of the LLM. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it cannot be significantly expedited or completed by the LLM alone.

2: E0

3: High
