1: In this task, the Funeral Attendants are responsible for carrying flowers to hearses or limousines for transportation to places of interment. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if access to the LLM or LLM-powered tools can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality.

- Funeral Attendants primarily involve physical tasks that require manual labor and interaction with physical objects (flowers, hearses, limousines). These tasks cannot be directly performed by the LLM or LLM-powered tools.
- The task does not involve complex decision-making, analysis of data, writing, summarizing, or any other text-based activities that the LLM excels at.
- There is no need for up-to-date facts, specialized domain knowledge, or image capabilities to complete this task.

Based on these considerations, it is clear that the task of carrying flowers to hearses or limousines for transportation does not align with any of the exposure levels in the rubric. The task is physical and manual in nature, requiring human interaction and cannot be significantly aided by the LLM or LLM-powered tools.
