1: In this task, a Structural Metal Fabricator and Fitter is required to align and fit parts according to specifications using various tools like jacks, turnbuckles, wedges, drift pins, pry bars, and hammers. This task involves physical manipulation of metal parts to ensure they fit together correctly. Since this task is hands-on and requires physical dexterity and spatial awareness, it cannot be effectively completed using an LLM or any software tool. The task involves precise measurements and adjustments that are best done by a skilled human worker. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not benefit from LLM exposure.
