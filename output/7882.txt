1: In this task, a lodging manager is required to inspect guest rooms, public areas, and grounds for cleanliness and appearance. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone or with additional software could significantly reduce the time it takes for a lodging manager to complete this task with high quality. 

- E0: This task involves physical inspection and assessment of cleanliness and appearance, which cannot be done solely through text-based interactions with the LLM. The task also requires on-site presence and human judgment, making it unsuitable for automation using the LLM or LLM-powered tools.
- E1: While the LLM could potentially provide some guidance on inspection criteria or checklists, the core task of physically inspecting and assessing cleanliness and appearance cannot be fully automated or significantly expedited by the LLM alone. 
- E2: It is conceivable that additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to assist lodging managers in creating inspection reports, maintaining records, or providing recommendations based on inspection data. However, the physical act of inspecting guest rooms, public areas, and grounds would still require human presence and judgment.
- E3: The task does not involve image processing or detailed visual analysis that would benefit from image capabilities in conjunction with the LLM. Therefore, this task does not fall under E3.

Based on the above analysis, the most appropriate label for this task is E1.

2: E1

3: Moderate
