1: In this task, the Appraisers and Assessors of Real Estate need to conduct regular reviews of properties to determine changes due to construction or demolition. To complete this task, they would typically need to gather information about the properties, analyze the changes, and make assessments based on their findings. With access to the powerful OpenAI large language model (LLM), the appraisers could potentially streamline the process of gathering information by quickly accessing data on property changes, regulations, and market trends. The LLM could assist in analyzing the data and providing insights to support the assessments. However, since the task involves physical inspections and assessments that may require on-site visits and detailed observations, the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task. Therefore, this task falls under E2 as additional software could be developed to enhance the capabilities of the LLM for this specific task.
