1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of "Determining sources of Web page or server problems, and taking action to correct such problems" for Web Administrators in terms of exposure to LLM, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM in assisting with this task. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM could potentially assist in providing troubleshooting steps, identifying common web page or server issues, suggesting solutions based on known problems, and generating documentation for issue resolution. This could significantly reduce the time it takes for a Web Administrator to troubleshoot and resolve problems.
- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - Additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to create automated diagnostic tools that can analyze server logs, detect anomalies, and recommend specific actions for problem resolution. This could further streamline the troubleshooting process.
- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities would not be relevant for this task as it primarily involves text-based troubleshooting of web page and server issues.

Based on the above considerations, the task of "Determining sources of Web page or server problems, and taking action to correct such problems" for Web Administrators would likely fall under E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications.
