1: In this task, the acupuncturist is required to apply heat or cold therapy to patients using various materials. To determine the exposure level, we need to consider if the task can be significantly aided by the use of the LLM. The task itself is hands-on and requires physical interaction with patients, which cannot be replaced by the LLM. The LLM cannot physically apply heat or cold therapy to patients. While the LLM could potentially provide information on the benefits or risks of using different therapy materials, it cannot directly assist in the application process. Therefore, the task does not align with any of the exposure levels in the rubric.
