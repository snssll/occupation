1: In this task, a Gambling Change Person and Booth Cashier listens for jackpot alarm bells and issues payoffs to winners. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if access to the LLM or LLM-powered tools can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality.

- The task involves auditory input (listening for jackpot alarm bells) and requires immediate action (issuing payoffs to winners).
- The task does not involve complex text processing, data analysis, or decision-making based on written information.
- The task is more operational and hands-on, involving physical actions in response to auditory cues.

Based on these considerations, it is clear that the task of listening for jackpot alarm bells and issuing payoffs to winners does not align with the capabilities of the LLM or LLM-powered tools. The nature of the task requires immediate physical action and interaction in a gambling environment, which cannot be effectively replaced or significantly enhanced by the LLM.
