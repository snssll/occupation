1: In this task, the Structural Iron and Steel Worker is required to fabricate metal parts based on blueprints or instructions. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality. 

- The task involves physical fabrication of metal parts, which cannot be directly assisted by the LLM as it requires hands-on work.
- The task does not involve text input or output that can be easily processed by the LLM.
- The LLM does not have the capability to provide real-time guidance or assistance in physical tasks like metal fabrication.
- The task does not involve written instructions or information that the LLM can process to provide assistance.

Based on these considerations, it is clear that the task of fabricating metal parts as a Structural Iron and Steel Worker falls under E0 as it does not benefit from exposure to the LLM.

2: E0
