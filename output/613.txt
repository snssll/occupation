1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of analyzing potential environmental impacts of production process changes and recommending steps to mitigate negative impacts as an Environmental Science and Protection Technician, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could assist in completing it.

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** The task involves analyzing information, identifying potential impacts, and recommending solutions, which are activities that can benefit from the LLM's ability to process and generate text based on complex instructions. The LLM can assist in researching environmental impacts, providing insights on mitigation strategies, and generating detailed reports based on the input data. Therefore, direct access to the LLM could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the LLM alone can be helpful in generating text and providing recommendations, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to enhance its capabilities further. For instance, specialized tools could be created to retrieve up-to-date environmental data, analyze complex environmental impacts, and make tailored recommendations based on specific production process changes. These additional features could streamline the process and improve the efficiency of completing the task.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Image capabilities are not directly relevant to the task of analyzing environmental impacts and recommending mitigation steps. The task primarily involves text-based analysis and recommendations related to environmental science, which can be effectively handled by the LLM without the need for image processing.
