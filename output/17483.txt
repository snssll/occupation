1: In this task, the Orthotists and Prosthetists are required to update their skills and knowledge by attending conferences and seminars. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider how the LLM can assist in this task. The LLM can help by providing information on upcoming conferences and seminars, summarizing key points from past events, generating questions to ask during these events, or even assisting in preparing presentations based on the knowledge gained. However, the LLM alone cannot physically attend these conferences or seminars on behalf of the Orthotists and Prosthetists. Therefore, while the LLM can provide valuable support in preparing for and following up on these events, it cannot fully replace the need for physical attendance.
