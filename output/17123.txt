1: In this task, the Low Vision Therapists, Orientation and Mobility Specialists, and Vision Rehabilitation Therapists are required to train clients with visual impairments to use various mobility devices. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be significantly aided by the use of the LLM. Since the task involves hands-on training, physical demonstrations, and personalized guidance, it is unlikely that the LLM can directly assist in this process. The task requires practical, real-world interactions and physical demonstrations that cannot be replaced by text-based instructions or virtual simulations. Therefore, the task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM.
