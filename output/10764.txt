1: In this task, the motorboat operator is required to operate engine throttles and steering mechanisms to guide boats on desired courses. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. Operating engine throttles and steering mechanisms involves physical actions and real-time decision-making based on environmental factors such as wind, currents, and obstacles in the water. This task requires hands-on skills, quick reflexes, and the ability to adapt to changing conditions on the water. Since this task involves physical actions and real-time decision-making that cannot be effectively replaced by text-based instructions or responses from an LLM, it falls under E0.

2: E0
