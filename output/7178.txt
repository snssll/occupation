1: In this task, a roofer is responsible for applying glaze to the top layers of a roof to create a smooth finish or embedding gravel in the bitumen for rough surfaces. To determine the appropriate exposure label for this task in relation to the LLM, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves manual labor and physical work that cannot be automated by text-based AI models like the LLM. The task requires hands-on skills, knowledge of roofing materials, and physical dexterity to apply the glaze or embed gravel effectively. Since the task does not involve text-based instructions, data analysis, or decision-making that can be significantly aided by the LLM, it falls under E0.
