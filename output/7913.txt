1: In this task, a Highway Maintenance Worker is required to inspect markers to verify accurate installation. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be aided by the LLM. 

- **E0**: This task involves physical inspection and verification of markers, which cannot be directly assisted by the LLM. The task does not involve text input or output, and the LLM does not have the capability to physically inspect markers.

- **E1**: While the LLM could potentially provide information on marker installation procedures or guidelines, it cannot directly assist in the physical inspection of markers. The task does not primarily involve text input or output that the LLM can significantly aid with.

- **E2**: It is conceivable that a specialized software application could be developed on top of the LLM that could provide guidance on marker inspection procedures or regulations. This software could potentially streamline the process by offering quick access to relevant information, but it would not directly assist in the physical inspection itself.

- **E3**: The task does not involve image processing or analysis that would benefit from the LLM's image capabilities. The inspection of markers does not require the LLM to view, caption, or create images.

Based on the analysis, the most appropriate exposure label for this task is **E0**.
