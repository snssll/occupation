1: In this task, a Meeting, Convention, and Event Planner is responsible for obtaining permits from fire and health departments to ensure compliance with safety regulations when setting up displays, exhibits, and serving food at events. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it. 

- E0: This task involves interacting with government agencies, understanding local regulations, and ensuring compliance with safety standards. It may require specific knowledge of local laws and regulations, as well as the ability to navigate the permit application process effectively. The LLM may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task, as it involves legal and regulatory nuances that require human judgment and expertise.

- E1: The LLM could potentially assist in providing general information on the permit application process, typical requirements, and best practices for obtaining permits from fire and health departments. It could help draft initial permit applications or provide templates for communication with the relevant authorities. However, the task still requires human judgment to navigate the specific requirements of each jurisdiction and ensure compliance with local regulations.

- E2: While the LLM alone may not reduce the time it takes to complete this task by half, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to streamline the permit application process. This software could potentially automate certain aspects of permit applications, provide real-time updates on regulatory changes, or offer personalized guidance based on the event details provided. Such tools could enhance efficiency and accuracy in obtaining permits for events.

- E3: The task does not involve image processing or visual content, so the image capabilities of the LLM are not directly relevant in this context.
