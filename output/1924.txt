1: In this task, the occupation of riggers involves cleaning and dressing machine surfaces and component parts. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality. 

- The task of cleaning and dressing machine surfaces and component parts is a physical task that requires manual labor and precision. It involves hands-on work that cannot be directly performed by the LLM.
- The LLM does not have the capability to physically interact with machines or components to clean or dress them.
- While the LLM can provide information on cleaning methods or materials, it cannot physically carry out the task itself.
- There are no text-based or written components to this task that the LLM can directly assist with.

Based on these considerations, it is clear that the task of cleaning and dressing machine surfaces and component parts falls under E0 as it does not involve text-based interactions that the LLM can assist with.
