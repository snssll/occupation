1: In this task, the Laundry and Dry-Cleaning Worker is responsible for loading articles into washers or dry-cleaning machines, or directing other workers to perform loading. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. This task involves physical actions such as loading articles into machines, which cannot be directly performed by an LLM. While the LLM could potentially provide information or guidance on best practices for loading articles, it cannot physically carry out the task itself. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not involve text-based activities that can be significantly expedited or enhanced by the LLM.

2: E0
