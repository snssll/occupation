1: In this task, a cost estimator is responsible for setting up cost monitoring and reporting systems and procedures. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. Setting up cost monitoring and reporting systems involves creating processes, templates, and guidelines for tracking and reporting costs related to a project or business operation. This task requires a good understanding of cost estimation principles, data analysis, and reporting.

Given that the task involves creating systems and procedures, an LLM could potentially assist in providing templates, guidelines, and best practices for setting up cost monitoring and reporting systems. The LLM could generate sample procedures, suggest key components to include in the systems, and offer insights on effective monitoring techniques. However, the task also requires domain-specific knowledge in cost estimation, which may not be readily available in the LLM.

Considering these factors, the task of setting up cost monitoring and reporting systems and procedures could benefit from the LLM's ability to provide general guidance and templates but may not significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced cost estimator to complete the task with high quality. Therefore, this task falls under E2 - Exposure by LLM-powered applications.
