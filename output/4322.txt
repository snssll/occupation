1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of designing cognitive aids as a Human Factors Engineer or Ergonomist, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be supported by the capabilities of the LLM. 

- Human Factors Engineers and Ergonomists typically work on designing tools and systems that optimize human performance and well-being in various environments.
- Designing cognitive aids like procedural storyboards or decision support systems involves a significant amount of creativity, understanding of human cognition, and tailoring solutions to specific user needs.
- While the LLM can assist in generating text, providing information, and even potentially offering some design suggestions based on input, the task of designing cognitive aids is highly specialized and requires domain-specific knowledge in human factors and ergonomics.
- The LLM may not have the specific expertise or domain knowledge required to fully understand the intricacies of human factors engineering and ergonomics to design effective cognitive aids.

Based on these considerations, the task of designing cognitive aids as a Human Factors Engineer or Ergonomist would likely fall under E0 as it involves highly specialized knowledge and creativity that may not be effectively supported by the LLM alone.
