1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of keeping abreast of game design technology and techniques, industry trends, and audience interests, reactions, and needs, we need to consider the nature of the task. This task involves staying updated on current literature, talking with colleagues, participating in educational programs, attending meetings or workshops, and engaging with professional organizations or conferences. While an LLM could potentially assist in summarizing current literature or providing insights on industry trends based on existing data, it may not significantly reduce the time it takes to actively engage with colleagues, attend events, or participate in professional organizations. The task also involves a level of human interaction and networking that may not be easily replaced by an LLM. Therefore, the task does not seem to fit into categories E1, E2, or E3.
