1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of leading or participating in fraud investigation teams as a Fraud Examiner, Investigator, or Analyst, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be supported by the capabilities of the LLM.

- E0: This task involves leading or participating in fraud investigation teams, which typically requires a high degree of human interaction, critical thinking, and decision-making based on complex information. While the LLM can provide information and insights, the core aspects of leading a team and conducting investigations involve human judgment and expertise that cannot be fully replaced by AI.

- E1: The LLM could potentially assist in providing background information, generating reports, or analyzing data related to fraud investigations. However, the core functions of leading a team, making strategic decisions, and interacting with stakeholders in a fraud investigation may not be significantly expedited by the LLM alone.

- E2: While the LLM could be used to analyze large volumes of text data related to fraud cases, it may not reduce the time it takes to lead or participate in fraud investigations by half. However, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to automate certain aspects of data analysis or report generation, which could enhance the efficiency of fraud examination tasks.

- E3: The task of leading or participating in fraud investigation teams does not directly involve image processing or creation, so the image capabilities of the LLM would not significantly impact the completion time of this task.
