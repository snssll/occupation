1: In this task, the Hotel, Motel, and Resort Desk Clerk is responsible for cleaning and maintaining the lobby and common areas, which includes restocking supplies and watering plants. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if the task can be significantly expedited or improved by using the LLM. 

- The task involves physical activities such as cleaning and watering plants, which cannot be directly performed by the LLM.
- While the LLM could potentially provide information on the best practices for cleaning and maintaining common areas, this information is likely already known to experienced workers in this field.
- The task does not involve complex decision-making, specialized domain knowledge, or detailed data analysis that would benefit significantly from LLM capabilities.

Based on these considerations, it is evident that the task of cleaning and maintaining the lobby and common areas for Hotel, Motel, and Resort Desk Clerks does not benefit from LLM exposure in a way that would significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task.
