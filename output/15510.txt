1: In this task, an Ophthalmic Laboratory Technician is required to select lens blanks, molds, tools, and polishing or grinding wheels according to production specifications. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. This task involves selecting specific items based on given specifications, which can be easily translated into text instructions for the LLM to understand. The LLM can assist in providing information on different types of lens blanks, molds, tools, and wheels based on production specifications. The LLM can also help in generating a list of suitable options based on the requirements provided. Since this task involves text input and output within the LLM's capabilities and does not require specialized domain knowledge or complex decision-making, it falls under the category of E1.
