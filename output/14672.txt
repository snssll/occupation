1: In this task, an Occupational Therapy Assistant is required to report to supervisors on patients' progress, attitudes, and behavior either verbally or in writing. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if the task can be significantly expedited or improved by using the LLM. The LLM can assist in generating written reports based on the information provided about patients' progress, attitudes, and behavior. It can help in structuring the report, providing insights, and ensuring clarity in communication. The LLM can also assist in summarizing data and generating key points to include in the report. However, since the task involves verbal reporting as well, the LLM may not directly aid in this aspect unless the assistant transcribes the generated text. Overall, the LLM can streamline the process of creating written reports but may not have a direct impact on verbal reporting.
