1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of transferring digital media to customers as an Online Merchant, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. In this task, the Online Merchant would likely need to communicate with customers, manage digital files, and potentially provide customer support related to the digital media being transferred. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM could assist in writing and responding to emails related to the transfer of digital media, providing information to customers, and potentially even drafting responses to common customer queries. It could also help in summarizing information or generating documentation related to the digital media being transferred.
- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time to complete the task, additional software built on top of the LLM could potentially streamline customer interactions, automate responses, or even manage digital media libraries more efficiently.
- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities would not significantly impact the task of transferring digital media via the Internet, as the task primarily involves text-based interactions and file management.

Considering the above points, the task of transferring digital media to customers as an Online Merchant would likely fall under E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications, as additional software leveraging the LLM's capabilities could enhance efficiency in customer interactions and digital media management.
