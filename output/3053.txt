1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of conducting research on economic issues and disseminating research findings as an economist, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it.

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** The task involves conducting research on economic issues and disseminating findings through technical reports or scientific articles. The LLM can assist in various aspects of this task, such as generating summaries of research papers, providing insights on economic trends, helping with data analysis, and even drafting sections of technical reports or articles. The LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to gather information, analyze data, and generate written content related to economic research.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the LLM alone can be highly beneficial for tasks like summarizing documents, providing insights, and generating content, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to further enhance its capabilities for economists. This software could include tools for retrieving up-to-date economic data, analyzing complex datasets, making recommendations based on research findings, and even assisting in the preparation of highly specialized economic reports.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Image capabilities are not directly relevant to the task of conducting research on economic issues and disseminating findings through reports or articles. Therefore, this label is not applicable to this task.
