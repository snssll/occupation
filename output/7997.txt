1: In this task of inspecting the cleanliness and practices of establishment employees as an Agricultural Inspector, the exposure to LLM can be evaluated as follows:

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** The task involves assessing and documenting the cleanliness and practices of establishment employees, which can be done by providing detailed written reports. The LLM can assist in generating these reports efficiently by transforming observations into structured text. The model can help in summarizing findings, providing feedback, and maintaining records of inspection reports. Therefore, direct access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the LLM can aid in generating reports and summaries, there may be additional software that could be developed on top of the LLM to further streamline the inspection process. For instance, specialized software could be created to analyze trends in inspection data, provide recommendations based on historical data, or even automate certain aspects of the inspection process. This additional software could potentially reduce the time taken to complete the task by half.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Image capabilities are not directly relevant to this task of inspecting the cleanliness and practices of establishment employees. The task primarily involves textual assessment and documentation, making image capabilities less impactful in this context.
