1: In this task, an embalmer is required to wash and dry bodies using specific tools and techniques. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone or with additional software could significantly reduce the time it takes for an embalmer to complete this task with equivalent quality. 

- E0: This task involves physical interaction with bodies and requires specialized skills and knowledge that cannot be replaced by text-based tools like the LLM. The task also does not involve decision-making that could be automated by the LLM.
- E1: While the LLM could potentially provide information on best practices for washing and drying bodies, it cannot physically perform these actions or provide hands-on assistance. Therefore, the LLM alone would not reduce the time it takes for an embalmer to complete this task by at least half.
- E2: It is conceivable that specialized software could be developed on top of the LLM to provide guidance on embalming procedures, safety protocols, or troubleshooting tips. This software could potentially reduce the time it takes for an embalmer to complete the task by half by offering real-time assistance or detailed instructions.
- E3: The task does not involve image processing or detailed visual analysis, so the image capabilities of the LLM would not significantly impact the completion time for an embalmer.
