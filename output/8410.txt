1: In this task of interviewing and hiring workers for gambling services, the LLM can assist by providing guidance on interview questions, suggesting best practices for hiring, drafting job descriptions, and even generating rejection or acceptance emails. The model can also help in creating training materials for new hires based on general knowledge of the industry. However, the actual interviewing process, decision-making on hiring, and human interaction aspects cannot be fully automated by the LLM.
