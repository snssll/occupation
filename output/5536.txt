1: In this task, the Transportation Security Screeners are responsible for directing passengers to areas where they can retrieve their baggage after it has been screened. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. This task involves providing clear and concise directions to passengers based on the completion of the screening process. The task does not involve complex data analysis, specialized domain knowledge, or the need for image capabilities. It primarily requires effective communication skills and knowledge of the airport layout.

Given that the task does not involve writing, summarizing documents, retrieving specialized domain knowledge, or utilizing image capabilities, it is unlikely that access to the LLM would significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task. The task is more focused on practical, on-the-ground interactions with passengers rather than text-based or analytical work that the LLM could assist with. Therefore, this task is best classified as E0 - No exposure.

2: E0

3: High
