1: In this task, the Appraisers and Assessors of Real Estate are required to prepare and maintain current data on each parcel assessed, including various details such as maps of boundaries, inventories of land and structures, property characteristics, and exemptions. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves a significant amount of data collection and organization, which can be time-consuming and require attention to detail.
- The task also involves maintaining up-to-date information, which may require accessing external sources for the latest data.
- While the task involves text input and output, the complexity lies in the accuracy and completeness of the data rather than in generating creative content.
- The task does not involve highly specialized domain knowledge beyond real estate assessment practices.

Considering these points, the task could benefit from the use of an LLM to assist in organizing and updating the data efficiently. The LLM could help in summarizing information, generating reports, and potentially even retrieving relevant data from external sources to keep the records current. Therefore, this task falls under label E1 as direct access to the LLM could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality.
