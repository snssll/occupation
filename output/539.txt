1: In this task, an Energy Auditor is required to analyze energy bills to gather historical energy usage data. With access to the powerful OpenAI large language model (LLM), the auditor can input the details from the energy bills and receive assistance in analyzing the data, understanding utility rates or tariffs, and extracting insights from the historical energy usage data. The LLM can help in summarizing the information, identifying patterns, and potentially even making recommendations based on the data provided. This task involves working with text-based information and does not require precise measurements or detailed visuals. Therefore, the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with high quality by providing valuable insights and analysis based on the input data.
