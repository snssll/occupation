1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of preparing reports that detail investigation findings as a Detective or Criminal Investigator, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves writing detailed reports based on investigation findings, which can be time-consuming and require a high level of detail and accuracy. The LLM can assist in generating written content, summarizing information, and providing feedback on documents. It can also help in organizing and structuring information effectively. However, the task may involve analyzing complex data, legal terminology, and specific investigative details that may require specialized domain knowledge beyond what the LLM can provide. While the LLM can aid in the writing process, it may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task due to the need for expertise in investigative work.
