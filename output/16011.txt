1: In this task, a helper in the painting, paperhanging, plastering, and stucco masonry field is required to smooth surfaces of articles to be painted using sanding and buffing tools and equipment. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if the task can be significantly aided by the use of the LLM. The task involves physical actions such as sanding and buffing, which cannot be directly assisted by the LLM. The LLM does not have the capability to perform physical tasks or interact with tools and equipment in the physical world. Therefore, the task does not fall under E1, E2, or E3 categories as it does not involve text input or output, and the LLM cannot directly assist in completing the task.

2: E0

3: High
