1: In this task, a millwright is responsible for laying out mounting holes using measuring instruments and drilling holes with a power drill. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves physical work that requires precise measurements and manual drilling, which cannot be directly performed by an LLM. While an LLM could potentially provide information on the process of laying out mounting holes or drilling techniques, it cannot physically carry out the task itself. Therefore, the task does not fall under E1, E2, or E3 as it does not involve text input or output, and it cannot be significantly aided by the capabilities of an LLM.

2: E0

3: High
