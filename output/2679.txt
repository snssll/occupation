1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of completing customs paperwork as a Freight Forwarder, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it.

- E1: Direct exposure - If the task involves writing and transforming text according to complex instructions, providing edits to existing text following specifications, or maintaining records of written data, the LLM could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality. In this case, the LLM could help generate accurate and detailed customs paperwork based on the provided information, potentially speeding up the process.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the task of completing customs paperwork may not be directly reducible to writing and transforming text, it is easy to imagine additional software built on top of the LLM that could streamline the process. For example, an application that retrieves up-to-date customs regulations and requirements from the internet and combines them with the LLM's capabilities to generate accurate paperwork could significantly reduce the time needed to complete the task.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Since the task of completing customs paperwork does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images, the use of image capabilities provided by the LLM would not significantly impact the completion time of the task.

Based on the above analysis, the task of completing customs paperwork as a Freight Forwarder is best classified as E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications.
