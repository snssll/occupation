1: In this task, a Clinical Research Coordinator is responsible for recording adverse event and side effect data and discussing the reporting of these events with investigators. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves primarily writing and transforming text, specifically recording data and communicating with investigators. This can be effectively done using the LLM, which excels at generating text based on input.
- The task does not require specialized domain knowledge beyond what the LLM can provide. The LLM can assist in summarizing information, providing feedback, and maintaining records, all of which are relevant to this task.
- While the task involves some level of decision-making regarding the reporting of events, the LLM can still provide recommendations and assist in drafting communication based on the input provided.
- The task does not involve detailed visuals or measurements, so image capabilities are not necessary.

Based on these considerations, the task of recording adverse event and side effect data and conferring with investigators can be significantly aided by the LLM, reducing the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality. Therefore, this task falls under label E1.
