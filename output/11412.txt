1: In this task, a mental health counselor is required to perform crisis interventions to ensure the safety of patients and others. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone or with additional software could significantly reduce the time it takes for a mental health counselor to complete this task with equivalent quality.

- E0: This task involves direct human interaction and requires immediate, real-time assessment and intervention to ensure the safety of individuals. The use of an LLM or LLM-powered tool would not be able to replace the human judgment, empathy, and real-time decision-making required in crisis interventions.

- E1: While the LLM could potentially provide general information or guidelines on crisis interventions, the critical aspect of immediate assessment, empathy, and tailored intervention based on the specific situation would still require human expertise. The time saved by using the LLM for this task would not be significant enough to warrant a label of E1.

- E2: Developing software on top of the LLM that could assist mental health counselors in crisis interventions would be challenging due to the real-time nature of the task and the need for human judgment and empathy. While the LLM could potentially provide general information or resources, the complex and dynamic nature of crisis interventions would likely not be effectively supported by software built on top of the LLM.

- E3: The task of performing crisis interventions in mental health counseling does not involve image processing or analysis, so the image capabilities of the LLM would not significantly impact the completion time of this task.
