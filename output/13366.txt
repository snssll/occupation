1: In this task, a physical therapist is required to provide information to the patient about a proposed intervention, its material risks and expected benefits, and any reasonable alternatives. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. Providing information to patients involves written or spoken communication, which can be effectively handled by the LLM. The LLM can assist in generating clear and informative explanations, outlining risks and benefits, and suggesting alternatives based on general knowledge and guidelines in the field of physical therapy. However, the task also involves a level of human interaction and empathy that the LLM may not fully capture. While the LLM can provide information, it may not be able to tailor the communication to the patient's specific needs, emotions, or reactions, which are crucial in a healthcare setting.
