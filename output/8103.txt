1: In this task, the Lighting Technicians are required to install electrical cables or wire fixtures. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. Since this task involves physical work that requires hands-on skills and precise measurements, it falls under the category of tasks that cannot be effectively completed by an LLM or LLM-powered tool. The task involves practical knowledge of electrical systems, safety regulations, and hands-on work that cannot be replicated by a language model alone. Therefore, this task would be classified as E0 as it does not benefit from the capabilities of an LLM.
