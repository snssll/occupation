1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of recording and editing audio material as an Audio and Video Technician, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves technical skills related to operating audio recording and editing equipment, which are not directly related to text-based tasks that the LLM excels at. The LLM does not have the ability to physically operate equipment or interact with audio signals directly. While the LLM could potentially provide information on audio recording techniques or software recommendations, it cannot directly perform the task of recording and editing audio material. Therefore, this task does not fall under E1, E2, or E3 as it does not align with the LLM's capabilities.

2: E0

3: High
