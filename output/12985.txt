1: In this task, the occupation of embalmers involves a specific action of pressing the diaphragm to evacuate air from the lungs of a deceased individual. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes for an embalmer to complete this task with high quality. 

- E0: This task involves a physical action that requires precision and direct interaction with a deceased body. The LLM cannot physically press the diaphragm or interact with the body, so it cannot directly assist in completing this task.
- E1: The LLM cannot physically perform the task of pressing the diaphragm, but it could potentially provide information or guidance on embalming techniques, safety protocols, or other related information that could indirectly assist an embalmer in performing their duties more effectively. However, the direct physical action required for this task cannot be replaced by the LLM.
- E2: While the LLM could potentially provide information on embalming techniques or safety procedures, it is unlikely that additional software developed on top of the LLM could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this specific task of pressing the diaphragm to evacuate air from the lungs.
- E3: The task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images, so the image capabilities of the LLM would not significantly impact the completion of this task.
