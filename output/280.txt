1: In this task, a Naturopathic Physician administers various treatments or therapies to patients using physical agents to help the body heal itself. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be significantly aided by the use of the language model. The task involves practical, hands-on skills and interactions with patients, which cannot be directly replaced by text-based interactions with an LLM. While the LLM could potentially provide information on different treatments or therapies, it cannot physically administer these treatments. Therefore, the task does not align with the capabilities of the LLM in a way that would significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task.
