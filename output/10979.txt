1: In this task, an allergist or immunologist is required to order or perform diagnostic tests such as skin pricks and intradermal, patch, or delayed hypersensitivity tests. To determine the appropriate exposure label for this task in relation to the LLM, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves medical procedures that require physical interaction with patients, precise measurements, and specialized medical knowledge. These tests also involve hands-on skills and expertise in interpreting the results accurately. While the LLM can provide general information about allergies and immunology, it cannot physically perform diagnostic tests or interact with patients. Therefore, the task does not align with the capabilities of the LLM or any tools built on top of it. As a result, this task falls under E0 as it does not significantly benefit from the use of the LLM.
