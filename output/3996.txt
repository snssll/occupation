1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of creating or maintaining plans related to sustainability projects as a Sustainability Specialist, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be impacted by the use of the OpenAI large language model (LLM).

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** The task involves writing and transforming text related to sustainability projects. The LLM can assist in generating detailed plans, reports, or documents based on the input provided by the specialist. The LLM can help in structuring the content, providing relevant information, and ensuring the documents are comprehensive and well-written. This direct access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the LLM can assist in generating text and providing information, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to streamline the process further. For example, specialized software could be created to analyze sustainability data, recommend specific actions based on the input, or even automate the generation of sustainability plans based on certain criteria. This additional software could enhance the efficiency of the specialist in completing the task.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Image capabilities are not directly relevant to the task of creating or maintaining plans related to sustainability projects. The task primarily involves text-based work, and image capabilities would not significantly impact the completion of this task.
