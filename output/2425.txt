1: In this task, a Petroleum Pump System Operator, Refinery Operator, or Gauger is required to collect product samples by turning bleeder valves or lowering containers into tanks to obtain oil samples. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. Collecting product samples involves physical actions such as turning valves and lowering containers, which cannot be directly performed by an LLM. Additionally, this task requires hands-on work and direct interaction with physical equipment, making it unsuitable for automation by an LLM. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM or any tools built on top of it.

2: E0
