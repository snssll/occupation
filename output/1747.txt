1: In this task, a Teaching Assistant in Special Education is required to carry out therapeutic regimens under the supervision of professionals like special education instructors, psychologists, or speech-language pathologists. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves implementing therapeutic programs, which may require understanding individual student needs, behavior modification techniques, and personal development strategies. While the LLM can provide general information on these topics, the task also involves hands-on interaction with students and the need for real-time assessment and adaptation of therapeutic interventions based on student responses. This level of human interaction and real-time decision-making is not something that the LLM can effectively replicate. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it requires a high degree of human interaction and real-time decision-making that cannot be effectively replaced by the LLM.
