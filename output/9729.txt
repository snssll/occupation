1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of mediating interpersonal problems between residents as a Residential Advisor, we need to consider the capabilities of the OpenAI large language model (LLM). 

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM can assist in providing guidance on conflict resolution strategies, suggesting communication techniques, and drafting written communication to facilitate mediation between residents. It can also help in preparing documentation of mediation sessions and follow-up actions. Overall, the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to handle mediation tasks with equivalent quality by at least half.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone can provide valuable insights and suggestions for mediation, additional software could be developed to enhance its capabilities further. This software could include real-time conflict analysis, personalized mediation strategies based on resident profiles, and automated follow-up procedures. Such applications could streamline the mediation process even more, but the current LLM itself is already quite effective in supporting mediation tasks.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not relevant for the task of mediating interpersonal problems between residents. This task primarily involves text-based communication and conflict resolution strategies, which can be effectively handled by the LLM without the need for image processing.

Based on the above analysis, the task of mediating interpersonal problems between residents as a Residential Advisor is best classified as E1: Direct exposure.
