1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of writing or contributing to instructions or manuals to guide end users for Computer Programmers, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM can assist in completing it.

- Writing instructions or manuals involves transforming text according to specific guidelines and requirements. The LLM can be used to generate clear and concise instructions, provide examples, and ensure the content is well-structured.
- The task does not involve highly specialized domain knowledge that the LLM may not possess. It primarily requires the ability to communicate technical information effectively.
- While the task may not be directly reducible to half the time with just the LLM, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to automate parts of the manual writing process, such as organizing information, generating templates, or providing suggestions for improvement.
- The LLM can assist in summarizing technical content, providing feedback on the clarity of instructions, and generating questions that end users might have about the manuals.

Based on these considerations, the task of writing or contributing to instructions or manuals for Computer Programmers would fall under label E2 - Exposure by LLM-powered applications.
