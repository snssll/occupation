1: In this task, the occupation involves Heating, Air Conditioning, and Refrigeration Mechanics and Installers, specifically focusing on installing expansion and control valves using acetylene torches and wrenches. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be impacted by the use of the LLM. 

- E0: This task involves hands-on work that requires physical skills such as using tools like acetylene torches and wrenches. The task is practical and involves manual labor, which cannot be directly substituted by the LLM or any software tool. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not benefit from LLM capabilities.
