1: In this task, the actor needs to attend auditions and casting calls to audition for roles. The task involves physical presence, interaction with casting directors, and showcasing acting skills in person. This task cannot be completed solely through text input and output. The LLM cannot replace the need for the actor to physically attend auditions and casting calls. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not benefit from the capabilities of the LLM.
