1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of identifying operational requirements for new systems to inform the selection of technological solutions for Radio Frequency Identification Device Specialists, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be aided by the use of a large language model (LLM).

- This task involves analyzing and understanding the operational needs of new systems, which may require reviewing technical specifications, understanding user requirements, and evaluating potential technological solutions.
- An LLM can assist in this task by providing information on best practices, industry standards, and potential technological solutions based on the input provided.
- The LLM can help generate ideas, suggest relevant criteria to consider, and provide insights into different technological solutions that align with operational requirements.
- While the LLM can offer valuable information and insights, the task also requires domain-specific knowledge and expertise in Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology, which the LLM may not possess.
- The task involves a level of complexity that may benefit from additional software tools tailored to the specific needs of RFID specialists, such as tools for analyzing technical specifications, comparing different solutions, and integrating domain-specific knowledge.

Based on these considerations, the task of identifying operational requirements for new systems to inform the selection of technological solutions for Radio Frequency Identification Device Specialists falls under label E2 - Exposure by LLM-powered applications.
