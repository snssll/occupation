1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of designing instructional aids for stand-alone or instructor-led classroom or online use as an Instructional Coordinator, we need to consider the level of exposure to LLM. 

- E1: Direct exposure - If the task involves writing and transforming text or code according to complex instructions, providing edits to existing text, or preparing training materials based on general knowledge, then direct access to the LLM could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality by at least half. In this case, designing instructional aids may involve writing text or creating visual aids, which could benefit from the LLM's capabilities in generating content.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the task of designing instructional aids may not directly benefit from LLM-powered applications that summarize documents or retrieve specialized domain knowledge, it is easy to imagine additional software that could be developed on top of the LLM to streamline the design process. For example, an application that can generate visual aids based on text input or provide recommendations for effective instructional materials could enhance the efficiency of the task.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - If the task involves creating or editing digital images according to instructions, then access to image capabilities alongside the LLM could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task. The ability to view, caption, and create images could assist in visualizing and designing instructional aids more efficiently.
