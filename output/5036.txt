1: In this task, a Web Administrator, Web and Digital Interface Designer, or Web Developer is responsible for developing or implementing procedures for ongoing website revision. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we can break down the task as follows:

- Writing and transforming text: The task involves creating procedures for website revision, which may require writing detailed instructions or guidelines.
- Providing edits to existing text: The individual may need to review and edit existing procedures to ensure they are up to date and effective.
- Writing code: Depending on the complexity of the procedures, the task may involve writing code snippets or scripts to automate certain aspects of website revision.
- Providing feedback on documents: The individual may need to provide feedback on existing procedures or documentation related to website revision.
- Prepare training materials: Developing procedures involves creating training materials for team members involved in website revision.

Considering these subtasks, the task can be significantly aided by the use of an LLM to draft detailed procedures, provide feedback, and generate training materials efficiently.
