1: In this task, an Automotive Service Technician or Mechanic is required to follow checklists to ensure all important parts of a vehicle are examined. This task involves a systematic process of checking various components of a vehicle for maintenance or repair purposes. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone or with additional software could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality.

- E0: This task involves physical inspection and hands-on work on vehicles, which cannot be replaced by text-based interactions with the LLM. The LLM does not have the capability to physically inspect or repair vehicles, so it cannot directly assist in this task.

- E1: While the LLM could potentially provide information on automotive parts, maintenance procedures, or troubleshooting tips, the task of physically inspecting and examining vehicle components based on checklists cannot be significantly expedited by text-based interactions with the LLM alone. The hands-on nature of this task requires practical experience and expertise that the LLM cannot provide.

- E2: It is conceivable that specialized software could be developed on top of the LLM to assist Automotive Service Technicians and Mechanics in organizing checklists, providing real-time diagnostic information, or generating maintenance reports. Such software could potentially streamline the process of following checklists and examining vehicle parts, thereby reducing the time needed to complete the task.

- E3: The task does not involve image processing or detailed visual analysis that would benefit from image capabilities in conjunction with the LLM. Therefore, this task does not fall under the E3 category.
