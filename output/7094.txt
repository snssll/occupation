1: Fundraising Managers are responsible for overseeing fundraising activities and developing strategies to raise funds for organizations. One of their tasks is to formulate policies and procedures related to fundraising programs. To determine the exposure level of this task to LLM, we can break it down as follows:

- Writing and transforming text: The task involves formulating policies and procedures, which requires writing and transforming text to clearly outline the guidelines for fundraising programs.
- Providing edits to existing text: The LLM can assist in providing edits to existing policies and procedures, ensuring they are comprehensive and well-written.
- Summarizing documents: The LLM can help summarize relevant documents on fundraising best practices, legal requirements, and organizational policies to inform the formulation of new policies.
- Analyzing written information: The LLM can analyze written information on successful fundraising strategies and industry trends to provide insights for policy formulation.

Considering the above points, the task of formulating policies and procedures related to fundraising programs can benefit significantly from the capabilities of the LLM, as it can assist in various aspects of the task, such as writing, editing, summarizing, and analyzing information.
