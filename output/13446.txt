1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of providing real-time data to emergency management and weather service personnel during flood events as a Hydrologic Technician, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be supported by the capabilities of the LLM.

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** The task involves relaying real-time data during flood events, which may require quick and accurate communication. The LLM could assist in generating reports, summarizing data, or drafting messages to convey the information effectively. The model can help in transforming text and providing updates promptly, potentially reducing the time needed to compile and communicate the data.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time to complete the task, additional software built on top of the LLM could enhance the process. For instance, an application that retrieves up-to-date flood data from various sources and integrates it with the technician's input could streamline the information-sharing process during emergencies.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** This task does not involve image processing or detailed visual analysis, so the image capabilities of the LLM are not directly relevant in this context.

Considering the task's reliance on real-time data communication during critical events, the most suitable label appears to be **E1 (Direct exposure)** as the LLM can assist in transforming text and providing updates efficiently.
