1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of developing and maintaining relationships with banking, insurance, and external accounting personnel as a Treasurer or Controller, we need to consider the level of exposure to LLM.

- This task involves communication and relationship management, which are primarily based on written and spoken interactions.
- The LLM can assist in drafting emails, preparing communication materials, providing feedback on documents, and potentially even generating questions or responses for interactions.
- While the LLM can help with written communication aspects of this task, it may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task, as the core of the task involves building and maintaining relationships, which require human interaction and nuanced understanding beyond text generation.

Based on these considerations, the task falls under E1 as the LLM can assist with written communication aspects but may not significantly reduce the time needed to complete the task due to the human-centric nature of relationship building.
