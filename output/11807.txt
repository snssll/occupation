1: In this task, a Food Preparation Worker is responsible for placing food trays over food warmers for immediate service or storing them in refrigerated storage cabinets. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it. 

- E0: This task involves physical actions of placing food trays over warmers or storing them in refrigerated cabinets. It does not involve complex decision-making or require specialized knowledge that an LLM could significantly assist with. Therefore, the task does not benefit from LLM exposure.

- E1: While the task involves simple actions, an LLM could potentially provide guidance on food safety regulations, optimal storage practices, or even suggest efficient ways to organize the trays. However, the direct impact of the LLM in reducing the time significantly for an experienced worker is limited in this case.

- E2: An application built on top of the LLM could potentially provide real-time updates on food safety guidelines, storage recommendations based on the latest research, or even suggest optimal tray placement based on efficiency algorithms. However, the task itself is relatively straightforward and may not require the additional capabilities that an E2 exposure would offer.

- E3: Image capabilities would not significantly impact this task as it does not involve detailed visual analysis or image creation/editing.

Considering the above analysis, the task of placing food trays over food warmers or storing them in refrigerated storage cabinets aligns best with the E1 label.

2: E1

3: Moderate
