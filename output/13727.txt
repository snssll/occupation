1: In this task, the helper-production worker is required to read gauges or charts and record the data obtained. This task involves basic data entry and does not require complex analysis or decision-making. The LLM could potentially assist in providing guidance on how to read certain types of gauges or charts, but the task itself is straightforward and does not involve specialized knowledge or complex reasoning. Therefore, the LLM's capabilities do not significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task.
