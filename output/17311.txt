1: In this task, a Computer, Automated Teller, and Office Machine Repairer is required to travel to customers' locations to service machines or provide emergency repair services. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone or with additional software could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task.

- E0: This task involves physical travel to customers' locations, which cannot be replaced by the LLM or any software. The repairer needs to physically inspect and repair the machines, which cannot be done through text-based interactions or tools.

- E1: While the repairer may use the LLM to look up technical information or troubleshooting guides, the core aspect of traveling to the location and physically repairing the machines cannot be replaced by the LLM alone. The LLM may provide some assistance in preparing for the repair, but it cannot perform the repair itself.

- E2: It is conceivable that additional software could be developed to assist repairers in diagnosing issues remotely or providing step-by-step repair instructions based on the information provided by the repairer. This software could potentially reduce the time it takes to complete the task by half by offering real-time troubleshooting guidance or remote diagnostics.

- E3: The task does not involve image processing or detailed visual analysis that would require image capabilities in addition to the LLM. Therefore, exposure to image capabilities would not significantly impact the completion of this task.
