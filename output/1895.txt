1: In this task, a Refractory Materials Repairer is required to chip slag from linings of ladles or remove linings when beyond repair using hammers and chisels. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. This task involves physical labor and manual work that cannot be directly assisted by an LLM. The task requires hands-on skills, strength, and precision in using tools like hammers and chisels. Since the task involves physical actions and does not primarily rely on text-based or cognitive functions that an LLM can assist with, it falls under the category of E0.
