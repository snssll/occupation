1: In this task, a Social Science Research Assistant is required to develop and implement research quality control procedures. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we can break down the task as follows:

- Developing research quality control procedures involves creating detailed guidelines and protocols to ensure the accuracy and reliability of research data.
- Implementing these procedures involves putting the developed guidelines into practice, monitoring adherence to them, and making adjustments as necessary.

Given that this task involves writing detailed procedures and guidelines, as well as potentially analyzing data to ensure quality control, it falls under the category of "Writing and transforming text and code according to complex instructions" from the E1 exposure rubric. The task can be significantly aided by the LLM in drafting comprehensive quality control procedures and guidelines.
