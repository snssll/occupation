1: In this task, the Cutting and Slicing Machine Setters, Operators, and Tenders are required to set up, operate, or tend machines that cut or slice various materials. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be significantly aided by the use of the language model. The task involves practical, hands-on work with machinery, which does not directly involve text-based instructions or information processing that the LLM excels at. The task is more physical and technical in nature, requiring manual dexterity and knowledge of machine operations. Therefore, it is unlikely that the LLM can provide substantial assistance in completing this task.
