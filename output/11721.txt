1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of performing tests such as blower-door tests to locate air leaks as Energy Auditors, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. In this task, the Energy Auditors are required to physically conduct tests using specialized equipment to identify air leaks in buildings. This task involves hands-on work and precise measurements, which cannot be directly performed by the LLM. The LLM does not have the ability to physically conduct tests or interact with the physical environment. Therefore, this task falls under the category of tasks that require physical presence and precise measurements, making it unsuitable for automation using the LLM.
