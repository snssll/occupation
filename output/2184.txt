1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of coaching senior executives and managers on leadership and performance as an Industrial-Organizational Psychologist, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be supported by the capabilities of the LLM.

- E0: This task involves a high degree of human interaction and personalized coaching, which cannot be effectively replaced by the LLM. The nuances of coaching senior executives and managers require emotional intelligence, empathy, and real-time feedback that an LLM cannot provide.

- E1: While the LLM can provide general information on leadership and performance, it lacks the ability to engage in real-time coaching sessions or provide personalized feedback tailored to individual executives and managers. The task of coaching involves dynamic interactions and practical exercises that go beyond the capabilities of the LLM.

- E2: It is conceivable that additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to provide recommendations or resources for coaching senior executives and managers. This software could potentially analyze leadership styles, provide case studies, or offer theoretical frameworks for coaching. However, the core aspect of personalized coaching and feedback would still require human expertise.

- E3: The task of coaching senior executives and managers on leadership and performance does not significantly benefit from image capabilities. The key aspects of coaching, such as communication, emotional intelligence, and interpersonal skills, are not enhanced by image processing capabilities.
