1: In this task, an Advertising and Promotions Manager is required to provide presentation and product demonstration support during the introduction of new products and services to field staff and customers. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves providing support during product introductions, which may require creating presentations, drafting scripts for demonstrations, and possibly generating promotional materials.
- The task involves communication and coordination with field staff and customers, which may involve writing emails, preparing training materials, and providing information.
- The task may involve summarizing key points about the new products and services, answering questions, and potentially making recommendations based on the information provided.

Given these considerations, the task involves writing and transforming text, providing edits, summarizing information, answering questions, and potentially making recommendations. These are tasks that can be effectively handled by an LLM, which can assist in generating content, summarizing information, and providing responses based on the input data. Therefore, this task falls under the E1 label as direct access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality.
