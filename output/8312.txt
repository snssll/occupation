1: Special Education Teachers, especially those working with elementary school and kindergarten students, have a task that involves instructing students with disabilities in academic subjects using various techniques tailored to meet individual needs. To determine the appropriate exposure label for this task in relation to the LLM, we can break it down as follows:

- Writing and transforming text: The task involves providing instruction and reinforcement techniques to students, which could potentially be aided by the LLM in generating lesson plans, instructional materials, or adapting teaching strategies based on individual student needs.
- Summarizing documents: While the task does not explicitly involve summarizing lengthy documents, the LLM could assist in summarizing educational research, student assessments, or individualized education plans to inform teaching strategies.
- Providing feedback on documents: The LLM could help in providing feedback on student progress reports, assessments, or educational plans.
- Analyzing written information to inform decisions: Special Education Teachers often need to analyze student data and educational research to make informed decisions about teaching strategies. The LLM could assist in analyzing this information and providing insights.

Considering these points, the task of instructing students with disabilities in academic subjects could benefit from the LLM's capabilities in generating instructional materials, summarizing educational content, providing feedback, and analyzing written information to inform teaching decisions. Therefore, this task aligns with exposure label E1.
