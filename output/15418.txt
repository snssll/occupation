1: In this task for Construction Managers, the main responsibility is to secure third-party verification from sources like LEED to ensure responsible design and building activities or to achieve favorable LEED ratings for building projects. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- This task involves a significant amount of communication and coordination with external parties to obtain third-party verification. The task requires understanding the requirements for LEED certification and ensuring that the building projects meet those standards.
- The task also involves writing and responding to emails, providing documentation, and potentially negotiating with the third-party verification sources to achieve favorable ratings.
- While the task involves some level of complexity and domain-specific knowledge related to construction and sustainability practices, it primarily revolves around written communication and coordination.

Based on these considerations, the task aligns closely with E1 - Direct exposure. The LLM can assist in drafting emails, summarizing information for verification purposes, and potentially providing guidance on LEED requirements, all of which can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality.
