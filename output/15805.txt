1: In this task, an Arbitrator, Mediator, or Conciliator is responsible for setting up appointments for parties to meet for mediation. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. Setting up appointments involves coordinating schedules, communicating with multiple parties, and ensuring logistical arrangements are in place. This task primarily involves written communication and organization skills.

- E1: Direct exposure to the LLM could potentially reduce the time it takes to complete this task by automating the process of scheduling appointments. The LLM could draft emails, reminders, and follow-ups, based on predefined templates or instructions provided by the user. This would streamline the communication process and save time for the Arbitrator, Mediator, or Conciliator.

- E2: While the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time to complete this task, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to create a scheduling tool specifically tailored for Arbitrators, Mediators, and Conciliators. This tool could integrate with calendars, suggest optimal meeting times based on availability, and automate reminders and confirmations.

- E3: Image capabilities are not relevant for this task as it primarily involves text-based communication and scheduling. Therefore, exposure to image capabilities would not significantly impact the completion of this task.

Based on the analysis above, the task of setting up appointments for parties to meet for mediation aligns best with the E2 exposure label.
