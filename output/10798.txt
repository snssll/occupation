1: In this task, a Heavy and Tractor-Trailer Truck Driver is required to operate idle reduction systems or auxiliary power systems to generate power from alternative sources. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task. The task involves practical, hands-on skills related to operating specific systems in a physical environment, which cannot be directly assisted by the LLM. The LLM does not have the capability to physically operate machinery or systems in the real world. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM or any tools built on top of it.

2: E0

3: High
