1: In this task, a Loading and Moving Machine Operator in Underground Mining is required to measure, weigh, or verify levels of rock, gravel, or other excavated material to prevent equipment overloads. This task involves physical actions such as measuring and weighing materials, which cannot be directly performed by an LLM. The task also requires on-site presence and interaction with the mining equipment, making it unsuitable for automation through text-based tools like an LLM. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not benefit from LLM exposure.
