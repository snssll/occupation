1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of training new employees as a Cook in an institution or cafeteria, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be impacted by the use of the LLM.

- E0: This task involves hands-on training, demonstration of cooking techniques, and practical skills that cannot be directly replaced by text-based instructions or responses from the LLM. The LLM cannot physically demonstrate tasks or provide real-time feedback on cooking techniques.

- E1: While the LLM can assist in creating training materials, providing written instructions, or answering questions related to cooking processes, it cannot fully replace the hands-on training required for new employees in a kitchen setting. The task of training new employees involves practical demonstrations, feedback on cooking techniques, and real-time interaction, which the LLM alone cannot provide.

- E2: It is conceivable that additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to assist in creating interactive training modules, virtual simulations of kitchen environments, or personalized learning experiences for new employees. This software could potentially enhance the training process by providing visual aids, interactive exercises, and real-time feedback based on the LLM's capabilities.

- E3: The task of training new employees as a Cook in an institution or cafeteria does not significantly benefit from image capabilities such as reading text from PDFs or creating/editing digital images. The core of this task lies in practical, hands-on training and demonstration of cooking skills, which cannot be effectively supported by image capabilities alone.
