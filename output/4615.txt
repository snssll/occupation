1: To determine the appropriate exposure label for the task of "Determine packaging requirements" for Logistics Analysts, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be aided by the capabilities of the LLM.

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** If the task involves analyzing data, specifications, and requirements to determine the most efficient packaging solutions, the LLM could assist in providing insights, generating recommendations, and even helping with calculations based on the input data. The LLM could potentially streamline the process of analyzing various factors that influence packaging requirements.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to create tools that can quickly process and analyze large amounts of data related to packaging requirements. This software could provide recommendations, optimize packaging solutions, and integrate real-time data to enhance decision-making.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Since the task of determining packaging requirements is primarily text-based and analytical, image capabilities would not significantly impact the completion of the task. Image capabilities are more relevant for tasks involving visual analysis or design, which are not central to determining packaging requirements.
