1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of quantifying energy consumption as an Energy Auditor, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM can assist in completing it. 

- Energy Auditors typically quantify energy consumption by analyzing data related to energy use in buildings or systems. This task involves processing numerical data, understanding energy consumption patterns, and establishing baselines for comparison.
- The LLM can assist in this task by providing guidance on energy consumption analysis techniques, suggesting best practices for establishing baselines, and potentially automating parts of the data analysis process.
- While the LLM can help with providing general information and insights on energy consumption, it may not have the specific domain knowledge or access to real-time data required to accurately quantify energy consumption in a particular building or system.
- The task does not involve detailed visual analysis or interactions that would require image capabilities.

Based on these considerations, the task of quantifying energy consumption as an Energy Auditor would likely fall under label E2 - Exposure by LLM-powered applications. While the LLM can provide valuable information and guidance for the task, additional software or tools specifically tailored for energy auditing may be needed to fully leverage the LLM's capabilities in this domain.
