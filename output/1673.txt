1: In this task, the Appraisers of Personal and Business Property need to calculate the value of property using various methods such as comparisons to recent sales, estimated cost to reproduce, and anticipated property income streams. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM could significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality.

- The task involves analyzing and synthesizing information from various sources to determine the value of property. The LLM could assist in providing information on recent sales data, cost estimates, and potential income streams based on historical data or general knowledge.
- The LLM could help in generating reports or summaries based on the input data provided by the appraiser, potentially saving time in organizing and presenting the information.
- However, the task also requires domain-specific knowledge and expertise in property appraisal, which the LLM may not possess to the same extent. The appraiser needs to interpret the data and make informed judgments based on their expertise.
- While the LLM can provide some assistance in data analysis and report generation, it may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task, as the appraisal process involves complex considerations beyond what the LLM can provide.
