1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of estimating or predicting the effects of global warming over time for specific geographic regions as an Atmospheric and Space Scientist, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The LLM can assist in tasks that involve analyzing data, generating predictions, and providing insights based on the information provided in the input text. In this case, the task involves utilizing scientific knowledge and data to make projections about the impacts of global warming on specific regions.

Given that the LLM can process text input and generate text output based on the context provided, it can be used to assist in analyzing historical climate data, understanding climate models, and making predictions about future climate scenarios. The LLM can help in summarizing research findings, generating hypotheses, and providing insights based on the information available within the 2000-word context limit.

However, the task of estimating the effects of global warming over time for specific geographic regions may require specialized domain knowledge in atmospheric science, climate modeling, and data analysis, which the LLM may not possess inherently. While the LLM can assist in processing and generating text related to climate data and projections, it may not have the specialized expertise to provide highly accurate or detailed predictions without significant human oversight and input.

Considering these factors, the task falls under E2 - Exposure by LLM-powered applications. While the LLM can aid in processing and analyzing text data related to climate science, additional software or tools specifically designed for climate modeling and analysis would be needed to fully leverage the LLM's capabilities for this task.
