1: In this task, a computer programmer is required to prepare detailed workflow charts and diagrams, describe input, output, and logical operations, and then convert them into a series of instructions coded in a computer language. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves a significant amount of technical knowledge and expertise in programming languages and logic.
- The task requires the ability to understand complex instructions and translate them into code.
- The task involves creating detailed diagrams and charts, which may require creativity and problem-solving skills.
- While the LLM can assist in generating text and code based on input, the task of creating detailed workflow charts and diagrams may not be directly reducible to text input and output within the 2000-word context limit.

Based on these considerations, the task falls under E2 - Exposure by LLM-powered applications. While the LLM alone may not reduce the time it takes to complete the task by half, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to assist in creating workflow charts and diagrams, thereby reducing the overall time required.

2: E2

3: Moderate
