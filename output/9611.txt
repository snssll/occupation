1: In this task, a Sawing Machine Setter, Operator, or Tender working with wood is required to measure and mark stock for cuts. This task involves physical actions such as measuring and marking, which cannot be directly performed by an LLM. While an LLM could potentially provide guidance on measurements or cutting instructions based on input text, it cannot physically measure or mark the stock. Therefore, this task does not fall under E1, E2, or E3 exposure categories as it does not involve text-based work that can be significantly aided by an LLM.
