1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of assessing existing facilities' needs for new or modified telecommunications systems as a Telecommunications Engineering Specialist, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it.

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** If the task involves analyzing existing data, reports, and specifications related to the facilities' telecommunications systems, the LLM could assist in summarizing this information, generating questions for further investigation, or even providing recommendations based on the data provided. The LLM could help in organizing and structuring the information needed for the assessment, potentially reducing the time it takes to gather insights and make informed decisions.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** If there are specialized tools or software developed on top of the LLM that can retrieve up-to-date information about telecommunications systems, industry standards, or best practices, and integrate this data with the existing knowledge base of the Telecommunications Engineering Specialist, it could significantly enhance the efficiency and accuracy of the assessment process. The LLM-powered applications could provide real-time updates, recommendations, and insights based on the latest trends and developments in the field.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Since the task does not involve detailed visuals or image processing, the image capabilities of the LLM would not have a significant impact on assessing the facilities' needs for new or modified telecommunications systems. Therefore, this task is unlikely to fall under E3.
