1: In this task, the Solar Thermal Installers and Technicians are required to apply operation or identification tags or labels to system components. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone through an interface like ChatGPT could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality. Since this task involves a physical action of applying tags or labels to system components, it does not directly involve text input or output that the LLM can assist with. The task does not involve complex instructions, writing, summarizing, or any other text-based activities that the LLM could directly aid in. Therefore, the task does not fall under E1 exposure. Additionally, developing software on top of the LLM to assist in physical labeling tasks is not feasible, as the LLM's capabilities are primarily text-based. Hence, it does not fit under E2 exposure either. The task also does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images, so it does not align with E3 exposure. Therefore, the most appropriate label for this task is E0, as the LLM and its capabilities do not significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete the physical task of applying tags or labels to system components.

2: E0

3: High
