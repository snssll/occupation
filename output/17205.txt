1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of training users in task techniques or ergonomic principles as a Human Factors Engineer or Ergonomist, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be impacted by the use of the LLM.

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** If the task involves creating training materials based on general knowledge, informing users of information via written or spoken medium, or providing feedback on documents related to task techniques or ergonomic principles, then direct access to the LLM could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete these tasks with equivalent quality. The LLM can assist in generating training materials, writing instructions, or even responding to user queries related to ergonomic principles.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the LLM alone may not reduce the time it takes to train users in task techniques or ergonomic principles by half, additional software built on top of the LLM could potentially streamline the process. For example, such software could summarize complex ergonomic principles, provide recommendations based on user input, or analyze written information to inform decisions related to training techniques.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Image capabilities would not significantly impact the task of training users in task techniques or ergonomic principles, as the primary focus is on conveying information through written or spoken mediums rather than visual content.
