1: In this task, a Lighting Technician is required to set up scaffolding or cranes to assist with the setting up of lighting equipment. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. Setting up scaffolding or cranes involves physical work that cannot be directly assisted by an LLM. The task requires hands-on skills, knowledge of safety regulations, and physical coordination to ensure the equipment is set up correctly and securely. Since this task involves physical actions and does not primarily rely on text-based instructions or information processing, it does not fall within the scope of tasks that can be significantly assisted by an LLM.
