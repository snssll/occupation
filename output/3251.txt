1: Private Detectives and Investigators often need to confer with various officials to gather information, provide updates, or receive instructions related to their investigations. This task involves communication, information exchange, and coordination with different parties. With the help of the LLM, a private detective or investigator could potentially draft emails, reports, or summaries of conversations to keep records of their interactions. The LLM could assist in generating questions to ask during these discussions or help in formulating responses based on the information received. However, since this task primarily involves verbal communication and coordination with multiple parties, the LLM's text-based capabilities may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task.
