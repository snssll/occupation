1: In this task, a Calibration Technologist or Technician is required to visually inspect equipment to detect surface defects. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality by at least half.

- E0: This task involves a high degree of human interaction and requires precise visual inspection skills that cannot be easily replicated by the LLM. The LLM does not have the capability to physically inspect equipment for surface defects.

- E1: The LLM could potentially assist by providing information on common surface defects, inspection techniques, or safety guidelines related to equipment inspection. However, the actual visual inspection process still heavily relies on human expertise and cannot be fully automated by the LLM.

- E2: While the LLM could potentially be used to access information on equipment inspection procedures or guidelines, it would not significantly reduce the time it takes to visually inspect equipment for surface defects. Developing software on top of the LLM that could automate this task would be challenging due to the physical nature of the inspection process.

- E3: The LLM, even with image capabilities, would not be able to accurately detect surface defects on equipment through visual inspection. This task requires detailed visual analysis and expertise that goes beyond the capabilities of the LLM.
