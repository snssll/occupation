1: In this task, a First-Line Supervisor of Security Workers is required to apprehend or evict trespassers, rule violators, or other security threats from the premises. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. This task involves physical action and real-time decision-making, which cannot be effectively performed by an LLM or any software tool alone. The task requires hands-on intervention, quick assessment of the situation, and physical presence, making it unsuitable for automation or assistance from an LLM. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM or any software tool based on it.
