1: In this task, a nurse anesthetist is required to insert peripheral or central intravenous catheters. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. Inserting intravenous catheters involves a high level of manual dexterity, precision, and knowledge of anatomy. This task is hands-on and requires physical interaction with patients. While the LLM can provide information on the procedure, it cannot physically perform the task itself. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not involve written or spoken communication that the LLM can assist with.
