1: In this task, a carpet installer is required to roll out, measure, mark, and cut carpeting to size based on floor sketches. The task involves following specific instructions, measurements, and sketches to ensure the carpet fits correctly. 

- E0: This task involves physical work that cannot be directly performed by an LLM. The LLM cannot physically roll out, measure, mark, and cut the carpet.
- E1: The LLM can potentially assist in generating floor sketches based on provided information, calculating measurements, or providing guidance on cutting techniques. However, the physical aspect of cutting the carpet cannot be directly performed by the LLM.
- E2: While the LLM can assist in generating floor sketches, providing measurements, and possibly offering tips on cutting techniques, the task still heavily relies on physical labor and manual skills. Additional software could potentially be developed to assist in generating more detailed floor plans or providing real-time guidance during the cutting process, but the core task of physically cutting the carpet remains a manual process.
- E3: The task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images, so the image capabilities of the LLM are not directly relevant to this task.
