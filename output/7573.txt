1: In this task, the General Internal Medicine Physicians are responsible for immunizing patients to protect them from preventable diseases. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. Immunizing patients involves hands-on medical procedures that require physical interaction with patients, such as administering vaccines through injections. This task also involves assessing the patient's medical history, determining the appropriate vaccines, and monitoring for any adverse reactions. Since this task is highly reliant on physical interaction, precise measurements, and real-time decision-making based on the patient's condition, it does not lend itself to automation or assistance from an LLM. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it cannot be significantly expedited or improved by the use of an LLM.
