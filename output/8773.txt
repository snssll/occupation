1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of leading field training sites and training individuals in excavation methods as an Anthropologist or Archeologist, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be impacted by the use of a large language model (LLM).

- E1: Direct exposure - If the task involves writing training materials, providing instructions, or documenting excavation methods, the LLM could significantly reduce the time needed to complete these tasks by generating text, instructions, or summaries based on the provided information. The LLM could assist in creating detailed guides or manuals for training purposes.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not reduce the time it takes to lead field training sites, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to summarize complex excavation methods, provide recommendations for training strategies, or analyze data related to fieldwork. This additional software could enhance the efficiency of preparing training materials and conducting fieldwork.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Since the task involves training individuals in excavation methods, having access to image capabilities could be beneficial for creating or editing digital images to illustrate specific techniques or procedures. The LLM could assist in generating captions or descriptions for these images, enhancing the training materials.
