1: For the task of designing, building, or maintaining websites as a Web Developer/Web and Digital Interface Designer, let's consider the exposure rubric:

- E1 (Direct exposure): The task involves creating, editing, and managing web content, which can be significantly aided by the use of an LLM. The LLM can assist in generating code snippets, providing design suggestions, and even helping with troubleshooting. The LLM can also be used to research the latest trends in web design and development, which can enhance the quality of the work produced.

- E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications): While the LLM alone can be beneficial for tasks like generating content and providing guidance, additional software built on top of the LLM could further streamline the process. For example, an application that can automatically generate website layouts based on user input or one that can analyze user behavior data to optimize website design could be developed.

- E3 (Exposure given image capabilities): Image capabilities are not directly relevant to the task of designing, building, or maintaining websites. This task primarily involves working with text, code, and digital media rather than detailed image processing.

Considering the above points, the task of designing, building, or maintaining websites as a Web Developer/Web and Digital Interface Designer would likely fall under E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications) as additional software could be developed to enhance the efficiency of the process beyond what the LLM alone can provide.
