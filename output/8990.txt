1: In this task, a Print Binding and Finishing Worker is required to lubricate, clean, or make minor repairs to machine parts to ensure the machines are in working condition. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if the task can be significantly expedited or improved by using the LLM. Since this task involves physical maintenance of machinery, it does not directly involve text input or output that the LLM can assist with. The LLM cannot physically lubricate, clean, or repair machine parts, and there are no text-based components that would benefit from the LLM's capabilities. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM.

2: E0
