1: In this task, the occupation of roofers involves covering roofs or exterior walls of structures with various materials using tools like brushes, knives, hammers, etc. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes for a roofer to complete this task with high quality. Since this task involves physical labor, precise measurements, and hands-on work with tools, it is unlikely that the LLM or any tool built on top of it can effectively assist in completing the task. The task requires practical skills, physical presence, and manual labor, which cannot be substituted by text-based AI models.
