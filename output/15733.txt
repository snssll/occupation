1: In this task, a Funeral Home Manager is responsible for setting marketing, sales, or financial goals for funeral service establishments and monitoring progress towards these goals. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves analyzing data, making decisions based on that data, and monitoring progress over time. While an LLM could potentially assist in providing information or generating reports related to marketing strategies or financial trends, the task also requires a level of human judgment and decision-making that may not be easily automated. The LLM could help with some aspects of the task, such as providing insights or generating reports, but the final decisions and goal-setting would likely still require human input. Therefore, this task falls under E2 - Exposure by LLM-powered applications, as additional software could be developed to assist with data analysis and reporting, but the core decision-making aspect would still rely on human expertise.
