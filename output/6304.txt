1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of estimating expected food consumption, requisitioning or purchasing supplies, or procuring food from storage as a Cook in a restaurant, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be aided by the use of an LLM.

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** The task involves a significant amount of text-based information processing, such as estimating food consumption, managing supplies, and making procurement decisions. An LLM could assist in generating estimates based on historical data, providing insights on optimal procurement strategies, or suggesting inventory management techniques. The LLM can help in writing reports, analyzing trends, and making informed decisions based on the input data.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the task can benefit from the text-based capabilities of an LLM, it may not be straightforward to reduce the time it takes to complete the task by half solely with the LLM. However, with additional software developed on top of the LLM, such as a specialized inventory management system that integrates with the LLM for data analysis and decision-making, the efficiency of completing the task could be significantly improved.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** The task does not involve image processing or detailed visual analysis, so the image capabilities of the LLM are not directly relevant in this context.
