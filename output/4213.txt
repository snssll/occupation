1: In this task, the Office Clerk is responsible for delivering messages and running errands. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality by at least half.

- E0: This task involves physical movement and human interaction, which cannot be replaced by the LLM. The LLM cannot perform tasks that require in-person demonstrations or physical actions like running errands.
- E1: The LLM can potentially assist in writing messages or providing instructions for the errands, but it cannot physically deliver messages or run errands. While it can help with written communication, the physical aspect of the task cannot be completed by the LLM alone.
- E2: While the LLM could potentially generate messages or instructions for the errands, it cannot physically carry out the task. However, additional software could potentially be developed to automate some aspects of message delivery or errand running, but this would require physical capabilities beyond text generation.
- E3: The task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images, so the image capabilities of the LLM are not relevant here.

Based on the analysis, the most appropriate label for this task is E0.

2: E0

3: High certainty
