1: In this task, a Plasterer or Stucco Mason is required to rough the undercoat surface with a scratcher to ensure proper adhesion of the finish coat. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality. Since this task involves physical work and manual labor, it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM, which is focused on text-based tasks and does not have the ability to perform physical actions. Therefore, the task falls under E0 as it does not benefit from LLM capabilities.

2: E0

3: High
