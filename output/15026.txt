1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of reviewing employment applications and job orders to match applicants with job requirements for Human Resources Specialists, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could assist in completing it.

- The task involves reviewing text-based information (employment applications and job orders) to make matches based on job requirements. This task primarily requires reading and understanding written content.
- The LLM can assist by quickly processing and analyzing the text provided in the applications and job orders to identify key qualifications and match them with the job requirements.
- The LLM can also potentially generate summaries of the applications and job orders, making it easier for the Human Resources Specialist to compare and match applicants efficiently.

Based on these considerations, the task falls under E1 as the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to review and match applicants with job requirements by providing quick analysis and summaries of the text-based information.
