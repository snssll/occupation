1: In this task, a Procurement Clerk is responsible for preparing invitation-of-bid forms and distributing them to supplier firms or for public posting. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if the task can be significantly expedited or improved by using the LLM. The task involves creating standardized forms and distributing them, which does not inherently require complex language generation or analysis beyond what a standard template might provide. The task is straightforward and does not involve specialized domain knowledge or complex decision-making. While the LLM could potentially assist in drafting the content of the forms, the time saved may not be substantial given the task's simplicity.
