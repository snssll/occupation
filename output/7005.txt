1: In this task, a machinist is required to fit and assemble parts to make or repair machine tools. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves physical manipulation of parts and tools, which cannot be directly assisted by an LLM. The task requires hands-on skills, precision, and knowledge of machinery. While an LLM could potentially provide information on machine tool repair techniques or troubleshooting tips, it cannot physically fit and assemble parts. Therefore, the task falls under E0 as it does not involve text-based work that can be significantly aided by an LLM.

2: E0
