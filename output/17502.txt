1: In this task, a massage therapist is using complementary aids to promote clients' recovery, relaxation, and well-being. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if the task can be completed more efficiently with the help of an LLM. Since the task involves physical actions like using infrared lamps, wet compresses, ice, and whirlpool baths, it does not directly involve text-based inputs or outputs that an LLM can assist with. The task also requires hands-on interaction with clients and physical aids, which cannot be replaced by text-based AI models. Therefore, this task does not fall under E1, E2, or E3 categories.

2: E0
