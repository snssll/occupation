1: In this task, the helper is required to mix mortar, plaster, and grout manually or using machines according to standard formulas. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone or with additional software could significantly reduce the time it takes for a worker to complete this task with high quality. 

- E0: This task involves physical labor and manual work that cannot be replaced by text-based tools like the LLM. The task requires hands-on mixing of materials, which cannot be done through text-based interfaces.

- E1: The task does not involve writing, transforming text, providing edits, translating languages, summarizing documents, or any other text-based activities that the LLM excels at. The task is more focused on manual labor and following standard formulas for mixing materials.

- E2: While it's possible to imagine software that could provide guidance on mixing materials based on standard formulas, the task itself is more practical and hands-on, requiring physical manipulation of materials. The LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task.

- E3: The task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images. The use of image capabilities would not significantly impact the completion of this task.
