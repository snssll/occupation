1: For the task of communicating with readers, viewers, advertisers, or the general public via mail, email, or telephone as a News Analyst, Reporter, or Journalist, we can consider the exposure rubric as follows:

- E1: Direct access to the LLM could potentially reduce the time it takes to draft emails, letters, or scripts for phone calls by providing suggestions, generating responses, or helping with language refinement. The LLM could assist in crafting effective communication tailored to different audiences, improving the efficiency of the communication process.

- E2: While having access to the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to streamline communication processes further. This software could include features like summarizing incoming information, providing real-time data for responses, or analyzing audience feedback to enhance communication strategies.

- E3: Image capabilities are not directly relevant to the task of communicating via mail, email, or telephone, so this exposure level does not apply in this context.

Considering the above points, the task of communicating with readers, viewers, advertisers, or the general public via mail, email, or telephone as a News Analyst, Reporter, or Journalist aligns best with **E1** as direct access to the LLM could significantly improve the efficiency and quality of communication.
