1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of developing or approving project plans, schedules, or budgets as a Computer Systems Engineer/Architect, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be impacted by the use of a large language model (LLM).

- E1: Direct exposure - Using an LLM directly could potentially reduce the time it takes to develop project plans, schedules, or budgets by assisting in generating detailed documentation, providing insights on best practices, or offering suggestions based on existing data. The LLM could help in drafting project plans, creating schedules, or estimating budgets based on historical data or industry standards.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While an LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time to complete this task, additional software built on top of the LLM could enhance the process. For example, an application that can analyze large datasets to provide recommendations for project timelines or budget allocations could streamline the decision-making process for Computer Systems Engineers/Architects.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities would not have a significant impact on developing or approving project plans, schedules, or budgets in this context. This task primarily involves text-based information and does not require image analysis or creation.
