1: In this task, a Cutting, Punching, and Press Machine Setter, Operator, or Tender in the Metal and Plastic industry is required to examine completed workpieces for defects and sort defective pieces according to types of flaws. This task involves visual inspection and categorization based on specific criteria. While an LLM could potentially provide information on common defects in metal and plastic workpieces, it cannot physically examine the workpieces or sort them based on flaws. The task also does not involve text input or output that the LLM could directly assist with. Therefore, this task does not align with any of the exposure levels in the rubric.
