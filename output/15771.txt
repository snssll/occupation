1: In this task, a Lighting Technician is responsible for setting up and focusing light fixtures to meet the specific requirements of various productions such as television, theater, concerts, etc. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it.

- E0: This task involves physical work that requires hands-on manipulation of equipment and fixtures to set up and focus lights. The task also involves understanding the specific requirements of different productions, which may involve on-site adjustments based on visual inspection and artistic judgment. The LLM does not have the capability to physically manipulate equipment or make on-site adjustments based on visual cues, so it cannot significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task.

- E1: While the LLM could potentially provide theoretical knowledge about lighting techniques, fixture types, or best practices for different types of productions, this information may not directly translate into practical assistance in setting up and focusing light fixtures on-site. The task requires physical presence, hands-on work, and real-time adjustments that cannot be effectively replaced by text-based information provided by the LLM.

- E2: It is conceivable that specialized software could be developed on top of the LLM that could assist Lighting Technicians in planning the setup of light fixtures based on specific production requirements. This software could potentially generate optimal lighting configurations based on input parameters, venue specifications, and production details. However, the actual physical setup and focusing of light fixtures would still require manual work and on-site adjustments that the LLM itself cannot perform.

- E3: The task of setting up and focusing light fixtures does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images. Therefore, the image capabilities provided by the LLM would not significantly impact the completion of this task.
