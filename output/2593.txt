1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of compiling and evaluating clinical practice statistics as a midwife, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. 

- E0: This task involves working with numerical data and statistics, which may not be directly related to text-based tasks that the LLM excels at. The task also requires domain-specific knowledge in healthcare and midwifery, which the LLM may not have access to without specific training or additional tools.
- E1: While the LLM can assist in writing reports or analyzing text-based information related to clinical practice statistics, the actual compilation and evaluation of numerical data may not be its primary strength. The LLM could potentially help in summarizing findings or generating insights based on the compiled statistics, but the core task of compiling and evaluating the data may not be significantly expedited by the LLM alone.
- E2: With the development of additional software that can integrate with the LLM to process and analyze numerical data, such as statistical analysis tools or data visualization software, the task of compiling and evaluating clinical practice statistics could be streamlined. This additional software could leverage the LLM's capabilities to interpret and generate insights from the data, enhancing the efficiency of the overall process.
- E3: The task of compiling and evaluating clinical practice statistics may not directly benefit from image capabilities, as it primarily involves working with numerical data rather than visual information. Therefore, the use of image capabilities in conjunction with the LLM may not significantly impact the completion time of this task.
