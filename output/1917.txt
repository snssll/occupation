1: In this task of cleaning aircraft interiors, an LLM could potentially be used to provide guidance on the most effective cleaning techniques, recommend specific cleaning products, or generate checklists for the cleaning process. The LLM could also assist in creating training materials for new aircraft service attendants on proper cleaning procedures. However, since the task primarily involves physical cleaning actions such as picking up waste, wiping down windows, and vacuuming, the LLM itself would not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task. While the LLM could provide some support in terms of information and guidance, the actual cleaning work would still need to be done manually.
