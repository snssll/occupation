1: In this task, a Computer Network Architect is required to communicate with system users to ensure accounts are set up properly or to diagnose and solve operational problems. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if direct access to the LLM could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality. 

- Direct access to the LLM could help in providing scripted responses for common account setup issues or operational problems, which could save time in communication.
- The LLM could assist in generating troubleshooting guides or documentation for system users, improving the efficiency of the communication process.
- The LLM could also aid in summarizing complex technical information for non-technical users, facilitating better understanding and communication.

Considering these points, direct access to the LLM through an interface like ChatGPT could reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality by at least half. Therefore, this task falls under label E1.

2: E1
