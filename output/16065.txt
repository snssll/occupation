1: In this task, a Fishing and Hunting Worker is responsible for sorting, packing, and storing the catch in holds with salt and ice. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves physical actions such as sorting, packing, and storing the catch, which cannot be directly performed by an LLM. While the LLM could potentially provide information on best practices for sorting, packing, and storing fish, it cannot physically carry out these actions. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not involve activities that can be significantly expedited or enhanced by the use of an LLM.

2: E0
