1: In this task, a Helper-Installation, Maintenance, and Repair Worker is required to install or replace machinery, equipment, and parts using hand or power tools. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality. Since this task involves physical work with machinery and tools, it is unlikely that the LLM can directly assist in the hands-on aspect of the installation or repair process. The LLM cannot physically manipulate tools or machinery, so it cannot directly replace the manual labor required for this task. Therefore, the task falls under E0 as it does not meet the criteria for exposure to LLM capabilities.

2: E0

3: High
