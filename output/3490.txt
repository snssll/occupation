1: In this task, a Credit Analyst is required to consult with customers to resolve complaints and verify financial and credit transactions. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves interacting with customers to address complaints and verify financial and credit transactions, which primarily requires human interaction, communication skills, and decision-making abilities. While an LLM could potentially assist in drafting written responses to complaints or providing information on financial transactions, the core aspect of consulting with customers and making decisions based on those interactions is not something that can be effectively automated by the LLM. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not significantly benefit from LLM capabilities.

2: E0
