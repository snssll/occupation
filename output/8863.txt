1: In this task, the Aircraft Service Attendants are responsible for loading baggage or cargo for crew or passengers. This task involves physical labor and coordination to ensure that the luggage is properly loaded onto the aircraft. Since this task is primarily physical and does not involve text input or output, it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM. The LLM cannot assist in physically loading baggage or cargo onto an aircraft, as it requires manual labor and coordination that cannot be performed by a language model. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not involve any text-based activities that the LLM can assist with.

2: E0
