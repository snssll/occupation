1: In this task, an embalmer is required to insert convex celluloid or cotton between eyeballs and eyelids to prevent slipping and sinking of eyelids during the embalming process. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. This task involves a physical, hands-on procedure that requires precision and expertise in handling human remains. It does not involve text input or output that can be easily processed by an LLM. The task also does not involve complex decision-making that can be automated by the LLM. Therefore, this task falls under the category of tasks that require physical interaction and precise measurements, making it unsuitable for automation by the LLM.
