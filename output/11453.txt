1: In this task, a nuclear engineer is required to perform experiments related to nuclear material usage, fuel reclamation, or waste disposal. To determine the exposure label for this task, we need to consider whether access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes for a nuclear engineer to perform these experiments with high quality.

- E0: This task involves hands-on experimentation and practical work in a specialized field like nuclear engineering. The LLM cannot physically perform experiments or handle nuclear materials, so it cannot directly assist in conducting these experiments.

- E1: The LLM could potentially assist in providing theoretical information, background research, or general knowledge related to nuclear material usage, fuel reclamation, or waste disposal. It could help in summarizing existing research, generating hypotheses, or even suggesting experimental methodologies based on available data. However, the actual hands-on experimentation and data collection would still need to be done by the nuclear engineer.

- E2: While the LLM alone may not be able to directly reduce the time it takes to perform the experiments, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to assist in analyzing experimental data, interpreting results, or even suggesting optimizations based on the outcomes of experiments. This software could enhance the efficiency of the experimental process.

- E3: Given the task does not involve detailed visual analysis or image processing, and the primary focus is on conducting experiments in the field of nuclear engineering, the image capabilities of the LLM would not significantly impact the completion of this task.
