1: In this task, an Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeon is required to remove tumors and abnormal growths from the oral and facial regions using surgical instruments. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. This task involves a high level of precision, expertise, and physical dexterity. It requires hands-on surgical skills and the ability to make critical decisions during the procedure. The task does not involve text-based inputs or outputs that can be easily processed by an LLM. Additionally, the task is highly specialized and requires domain-specific knowledge that may not be readily available in text form for the LLM to access. Therefore, the task of removing tumors and abnormal growths as an Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeon falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM or any tools built on top of it.
