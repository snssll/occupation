1: In this task of replacing or adjusting window-raising mechanisms in vehicles, the use of the LLM could potentially fall under E2 exposure. While the LLM could assist in providing general information on how to replace or adjust these mechanisms, it may not significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete the task. However, with the development of additional software that could provide step-by-step visual guides or interactive tutorials based on the LLM's information, the task could be completed more efficiently.
