1: In this task, a Tire Builder needs to measure tires to determine the mold size requirements. This task involves precise measurements and physical interaction with the tires. The task does not involve text input or output that can be effectively processed by an LLM. The LLM does not have the capability to physically measure tires or interact with physical objects. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it cannot be significantly aided by the LLM or any tools built on top of it.
