1: In this task of washing metal instruments in lacquer-stripping and cyanide solutions, the main actions involve physical handling of instruments and chemical solutions. This task does not involve text input or output, complex instructions, data analysis, or decision-making based on information processing. The task is purely manual and requires specific skills related to instrument repair and maintenance. Therefore, there is no direct application of the LLM in completing this task, as the LLM cannot physically handle instruments or chemical solutions. Additionally, developing software on top of the LLM to automate this task would not be feasible or practical, as it involves physical actions that cannot be replicated through text-based instructions or data processing.
