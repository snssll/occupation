1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of investigating mechanical failures or unexpected maintenance problems as a Robotics Engineer, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be aided by the use of a large language model (LLM).

- E1: Direct exposure - If the task involves writing reports, documenting findings, or communicating with team members about the issues encountered, an LLM could significantly reduce the time needed to draft these documents. The LLM could help in summarizing data, generating reports, or even suggesting potential solutions based on the input provided.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While an LLM alone may not directly reduce the time it takes to investigate mechanical failures, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to assist in analyzing complex data related to the failures. This software could help in summarizing technical documents, retrieving relevant information from databases, or even providing recommendations based on the data analyzed.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Since investigating mechanical failures may involve analyzing images of the components or systems, having access to image capabilities along with the LLM could aid in reading text from technical diagrams or images, scanning images for details, or creating visual representations of the issues encountered.

Considering the task of investigating mechanical failures or unexpected maintenance problems as a Robotics Engineer, the most suitable label appears to be E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications. While the LLM alone may not directly reduce the time for this task, the development of additional software leveraging the LLM's capabilities could enhance the analysis and decision-making process in investigating such issues.
