1: In this task, the Advertising Sales Agents need to draw up contracts for advertising work and collect payments due. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. Drawing up contracts involves writing legal documents that outline the terms and conditions of the advertising work, which requires a good understanding of legal language and contract law. Collecting payments involves financial transactions and possibly negotiations with clients. While an LLM can assist in drafting contract language and providing templates, it may not have the legal expertise to ensure the contracts are legally sound. Additionally, collecting payments may involve personal interactions and financial transactions that the LLM cannot directly handle. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it involves legal and financial aspects that require human expertise and interaction.
