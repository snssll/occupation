To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if access to the LLM or LLM-powered tools can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality by at least half.

Laborers guiding loads being lifted to prevent swinging is a physical task that requires hands-on interaction and real-time decision-making to ensure safety and efficiency. The task does not involve text input or output, complex instructions, data analysis, or any other form of information processing that could be directly assisted by an LLM. Therefore, the task falls under the category of tasks that cannot be effectively assisted by the LLM or LLM-powered tools.
