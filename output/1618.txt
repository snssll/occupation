1: In this task, the Order Clerks are required to calculate and compile order-related statistics and prepare reports for management. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves working with text data (order-related statistics and reports).
- The task requires transforming and summarizing data into a coherent report.
- The task involves providing information based on specific instructions.
- The task does not involve any visual or image processing.

Given these considerations, the task can be effectively completed using the capabilities of the LLM. The LLM can assist in processing and summarizing the data, generating reports, and providing insights based on the input data. Therefore, this task falls under the E1 label as direct access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality.
