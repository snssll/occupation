1: In this task, the operator needs to become familiar with digging plans, machine capabilities, limitations, and efficient and safe digging procedures. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be significantly expedited or improved by using the language model. The LLM could potentially assist in providing information on digging plans, machine capabilities, and safe digging procedures. It could generate summaries, provide detailed explanations, or even offer insights based on best practices in the industry. However, the task also involves practical knowledge of operating heavy machinery, which may not be effectively substituted by text-based information alone. While the LLM could provide valuable information, it may not directly reduce the time it takes for an experienced operator to become familiar with these aspects.
