1: In this task, the Appraisers and Assessors of Real Estate need to evaluate land and neighborhoods to determine the value of properties. This involves considering various factors such as locations, trends, and impending changes that could impact future property values. With access to the most powerful OpenAI large language model (LLM), the appraisers could potentially use the model to gather information on current trends in real estate, analyze data on neighborhood developments, and understand how certain changes might affect property values. The LLM could assist in providing insights into market trends, demographic shifts, and other relevant information that could influence property values. By utilizing the LLM, the appraisers could enhance their analysis and decision-making process, potentially saving time in researching and gathering relevant data.
