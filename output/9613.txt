1: In this task for Drywall and Ceiling Tile Installers, the main activity involves measuring and marking surfaces according to blueprints or drawings. This task is highly manual and requires physical interaction with the surfaces and tools like tape measures, straightedges, squares, and marking devices. The task does not involve text input or output that can be easily processed by an LLM. While an LLM could potentially assist in generating or interpreting blueprints or drawings, the core aspect of measuring and marking surfaces physically cannot be directly handled by the LLM. Therefore, this task does not fall under any of the exposure categories (E0, E1, E2, E3) as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM.

2: E0

3: High
