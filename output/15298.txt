1: In this task, an Eligibility Interviewer working for Government Programs is responsible for scheduling benefits claimants for adjudication interviews to determine their eligibility for certain programs. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it more efficiently. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM could assist in writing and transforming text related to scheduling interviews, providing edits to scheduling documents, generating questions for interviews, or even responding to emails related to scheduling. The LLM could help streamline the communication process and ensure accurate and timely scheduling of interviews.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time it takes to schedule interviews, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to automate the scheduling process, retrieve up-to-date information on claimants, or provide recommendations based on data analysis to optimize interview scheduling.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities would not significantly impact the task of scheduling interviews for benefits claimants, as it primarily involves text-based communication and coordination.
