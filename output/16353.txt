1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of studying celestial phenomena as an astronomer, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves using telescopes and scientific instruments to study celestial phenomena, which requires specialized knowledge and expertise in the field of astronomy. The LLM can provide general information about astronomy and celestial bodies, but it may not have access to up-to-date data from telescopes or scientific instruments unless explicitly provided in the input. The LLM may be able to assist with summarizing existing research or providing background information on celestial phenomena, but it may not be able to directly analyze data from telescopes or scientific instruments.
