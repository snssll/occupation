1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of responding to passengers' questions, requests, or complaints as a Passenger Attendant, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. In this case, the task involves written communication with passengers, which can be effectively handled by the LLM. The LLM can assist in crafting responses, addressing inquiries, and handling complaints through written text. The model can generate appropriate language, provide information, and even offer suggestions on how to address different types of passenger interactions. Since the task primarily involves written communication and does not require specialized domain knowledge beyond general customer service skills, the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality.
