1: In this task, the Aerospace Engineer is responsible for directing or coordinating activities related to designing, fabricating, modifying, or testing aircraft or aerospace products. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- Direct exposure (E1): If the task involves writing reports, coordinating activities, providing feedback on designs, or any other text-based activities related to aerospace engineering, the LLM could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete these tasks with equivalent quality by providing assistance in drafting documents, summarizing information, or generating reports.

- Exposure by LLM-powered applications (E2): While the LLM alone may not reduce the time it takes to coordinate engineering activities, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to assist in summarizing technical documents, retrieving up-to-date information on aerospace products, or providing recommendations based on data analysis.

- Exposure given image capabilities (E3): Since the task does not involve detailed visual analysis or require image editing, the image capabilities of the LLM would not significantly impact the completion time of coordinating engineering activities in aerospace.

Considering the nature of the task and the potential for the LLM to assist in text-based activities related to aerospace engineering, the most appropriate label seems to be E1.

2: E1

3: Moderate
