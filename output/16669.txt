1: In this task, the occupation involves assembling aircraft structures, surfaces, rigging, and systems. The specific task mentioned is swaging fittings onto cables using swaging machines. To complete this task, the worker needs to have knowledge of aircraft components, tools, and safety procedures. The task itself is hands-on and requires physical manipulation of materials and machinery. The LLM, even though powerful in text-based tasks, does not have the capability to physically interact with objects or machinery. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it cannot be significantly aided by the LLM or any tools built on top of it.
