1: In this task, a Public Relations Manager is required to establish and maintain effective working relationships with clients, government officials, and media representatives to develop new business opportunities. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we can break down the task as follows:

- Writing and transforming text: The task involves communication and relationship-building, which may require writing emails, proposals, or other written correspondence. The LLM can assist in drafting these communications effectively.
- Providing feedback on documents: The LLM can help provide feedback on written materials such as proposals or press releases.
- Informing others of information: The LLM can assist in providing information about clients, government officials, or media representatives to aid in building relationships.

Considering these aspects, the task can benefit significantly from the direct access to the LLM, as it can assist in various written communication aspects and providing information. Therefore, this task falls under the E1 exposure label.
