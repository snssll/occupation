1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of "Package, store and retrieve evidence" for Police Identification and Records Officers in terms of exposure to LLM, we need to consider the nature of the task. This task involves physical actions such as handling evidence, which cannot be directly performed by an LLM. While an LLM could potentially assist in generating documentation related to the evidence or providing information on proper storage procedures, the core task of physically handling evidence cannot be automated by the LLM. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not significantly benefit from LLM capabilities.
