1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of performing record checks on past or current licensees as required by investigations for Court, Municipal, and License Clerks, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. In this task, the LLM can assist by providing guidance on how to conduct record checks, suggesting relevant databases or sources to search, and helping to draft reports based on the information found. The LLM can also aid in summarizing the findings and generating insights from the data collected during the record checks. However, since this task involves accessing specific databases and conducting investigations, which may require interacting with external systems or physical records, the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task. Therefore, this task falls under E2 as additional software could be developed to streamline the process by integrating with external databases and automating certain aspects of the record check process.
