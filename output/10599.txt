1: In this task, a recreational therapist is required to obtain information from various sources to assess patients' capabilities, needs, and interests. This task involves gathering data from medical records, medical staff, family members, and the patients themselves. With the help of a large language model (LLM), the therapist could potentially streamline the process of extracting and organizing relevant information from these sources. The LLM could assist in summarizing medical records, generating questions to ask during assessments, and even drafting initial assessment reports based on the gathered information. This would significantly reduce the time and effort required to compile and analyze the data necessary for patient assessments.

Considering the capabilities of the LLM to process and generate text based on complex instructions and information, as well as its potential to assist in organizing and summarizing data, this task falls under the category of E1 - Direct exposure. The LLM can enhance the efficiency and accuracy of information gathering and assessment processes for recreational therapists.
