1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of performing minor aircraft maintenance and repair work or arranging for major maintenance as a Commercial Pilot, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be aided by the use of an LLM.

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** If the task involves writing detailed maintenance procedures, documenting repair work, communicating with maintenance personnel, or researching maintenance issues, the LLM could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete these tasks by providing accurate information, generating reports, or assisting in communication.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** If there were specialized software developed on top of the LLM that could quickly summarize maintenance manuals, provide up-to-date information on aircraft maintenance practices, or analyze maintenance data to make recommendations, it could potentially reduce the time needed to perform maintenance tasks.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** If the task involved reading technical diagrams, schematics, or images related to aircraft maintenance, having image capabilities could assist in interpreting visual information more efficiently.

Considering the task of performing minor aircraft maintenance and repair work or arranging for major maintenance, the most suitable label appears to be **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications)**. While the task may not directly benefit from the LLM alone reducing the time by half, the development of specialized software leveraging the LLM's capabilities could streamline processes related to maintenance procedures, data analysis, and information retrieval.
