1: For the task of performing food preparation tasks as a Short Order Cook, the exposure to LLM can be evaluated as follows:

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** The task involves following specific instructions for food preparation, which can be aided by the LLM in providing recipes, techniques, and tips for making sandwiches, carving meats, making soups or salads, baking breads or desserts, and brewing coffee or tea. The LLM can assist in generating detailed instructions, suggesting variations, and providing information on different cuisines.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to create personalized recipe databases, suggest ingredient substitutions, offer nutritional information, or even automate certain aspects of food preparation based on user input.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Image capabilities would not significantly enhance the task of performing food preparation tasks as described for Short Order Cooks. The task primarily involves text-based instructions and hands-on food preparation rather than relying on image processing.
