1: In this task, a Real Estate Sales Agent is responsible for coordinating appointments to show homes to prospective buyers. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it more efficiently.

- E0: This task involves human interaction and coordination, which may not be significantly aided by the LLM. The LLM cannot physically coordinate appointments or interact directly with prospective buyers.
- E1: The LLM could potentially assist in drafting emails or messages to schedule appointments, providing templates for communication, or even generating reminders for follow-ups. It could also help in summarizing information about properties to share with prospective buyers.
- E2: While the LLM alone may not reduce the time significantly for this task, additional software could be developed to integrate with the LLM to automate appointment scheduling based on preferences, availability, and property details. This software could use the LLM to analyze buyer preferences and property information to suggest optimal appointment times.
- E3: Image capabilities are not relevant for this task as it primarily involves coordinating appointments through text-based communication.

Based on the analysis, the task of coordinating appointments to show homes to prospective buyers could be best classified as E1.

2: E1
