1: In this task, an Advanced Practice Psychiatric Nurse is required to develop, implement, or evaluate programs such as outreach activities, community mental health programs, and crisis situation response activities. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality.

- E0: This task involves a high level of human interaction and specialized knowledge in the field of mental health. The task requires expertise in designing and evaluating mental health programs, which may involve complex decision-making processes that cannot be fully automated by the LLM.

- E1: While the LLM can provide general information or assist in drafting program proposals, it may not have the specialized knowledge and expertise required to develop and evaluate mental health programs effectively. The task involves a level of complexity and domain-specific knowledge that goes beyond what the LLM can provide on its own.

- E2: It is conceivable that additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to assist in summarizing research findings, analyzing data related to program effectiveness, or generating program evaluation reports. However, the specialized nature of mental health programs and the need for human judgment in evaluating their impact may limit the extent to which software can fully automate this task.

- E3: The task does not involve image processing or detailed visual analysis, so the image capabilities of the LLM are not relevant in this context.

2: E0

3: Certainty level: High
