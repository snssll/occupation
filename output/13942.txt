1: In this task, a Retail Loss Prevention Specialist is required to recommend new or improved processes or equipment to reduce risk exposure in a retail setting. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we can break down the task as follows:

- Research current processes and equipment used in retail settings to understand common practices and potential areas of improvement.
- Analyze data related to past incidents or risks to identify patterns or areas of vulnerability.
- Generate ideas for new processes or equipment that could enhance security and reduce risk exposure.
- Evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of these recommendations based on cost, implementation complexity, and potential impact.
- Present these recommendations to relevant stakeholders for approval and implementation.

Given the nature of the task, it involves a significant amount of research, analysis, and decision-making based on domain-specific knowledge related to retail security and risk management. While an LLM could assist in providing general information on risk management practices, it may not have the specialized knowledge required to make specific recommendations for retail loss prevention. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not clearly decrease the time it takes for an experienced Retail Loss Prevention Specialist to complete the task with high quality by at least half.
