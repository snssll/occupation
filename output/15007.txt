1: In this task for Correspondence Clerks, the main activities involve reviewing correspondence for format and typographical accuracy, assembling the information into a prescribed form with the correct number of copies, and submitting it for signature. These tasks heavily rely on written communication skills, attention to detail, and adherence to specific guidelines. 

To determine the exposure level, we need to consider if the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete these tasks with equivalent quality. The LLM can assist in proofreading, formatting, and potentially even generating templates for correspondence. It can also help in ensuring accuracy and consistency in the content. However, the task also involves physical actions like assembling copies and submitting them for signature, which the LLM cannot perform. 

Considering these factors, the LLM can streamline some aspects of the task but cannot fully automate it due to the physical actions involved. Therefore, I would classify this task as E2 - Exposure by LLM-powered applications.
