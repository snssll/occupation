1: In this task, a Recycling and Reclamation Worker is required to cut discarded products into small pieces using various tools. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone or with additional software could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality.

- E0: This task involves physical labor and precise measurements, which cannot be effectively replaced by the LLM or any software built on top of it. The task also does not involve any written or spoken communication that could benefit from the LLM's capabilities.

- E1: The task description does not involve complex instructions, writing, summarizing, or any form of communication that the LLM could directly assist with. Therefore, direct access to the LLM would not reduce the time significantly for completing this task.

- E2: While it is conceivable that software could be developed to provide guidance or instructions on cutting specific products based on text inputs, the nature of the task involving physical cutting with tools makes it challenging to significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task by half using the LLM alone.

- E3: The task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images. Therefore, the image capabilities of the LLM would not significantly reduce the time to complete this task.
