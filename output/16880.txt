1: In this task, the Automotive Service Technicians and Mechanics need to test and adjust repaired systems to meet manufacturers' performance specifications. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality by at least half.

- The task involves practical, hands-on work that requires physical interaction with vehicles and systems, such as testing and adjusting. This type of work cannot be directly assisted by the LLM.
- The task also involves technical knowledge and skills specific to automotive systems and manufacturers' specifications, which may not be readily available in the LLM.
- While the LLM could potentially provide some general information on testing and adjusting systems, it is unlikely to have the specific, detailed knowledge required for this task.
- The task does not involve writing, summarizing documents, or other text-based activities where the LLM could directly assist.

Based on these considerations, it is clear that the task of testing and adjusting repaired systems in the automotive field is not suitable for direct exposure to the LLM.
