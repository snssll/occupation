1: In this task, a locomotive engineer is responsible for checking to ensure that brake examination tests are conducted at shunting stations. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves verifying a specific procedure (brake examination tests) at designated locations (shunting stations). 
- The task does not require complex decision-making, critical analysis, or specialized domain knowledge beyond the standard procedures for brake examinations. 
- The task is primarily procedural and involves ensuring compliance with established protocols. 
- The task does not involve detailed measurements, visual inspections, or interactions that require human judgment beyond following set guidelines.

Based on these considerations, the task does not significantly benefit from the capabilities of an LLM or additional software beyond what is already known and practiced in the field of locomotive engineering. Therefore, this task would fall under the E0 label as it does not meet the criteria for exposure to LLM capabilities.
