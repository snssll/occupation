1: In this task, a physical therapist is required to instruct patients and their families on treatment procedures to be continued at home. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves providing instructions and guidance on treatment procedures, which primarily involves verbal communication and possibly written instructions. An LLM could potentially assist in generating detailed and clear instructions for various treatment procedures, as well as providing explanations in a patient-friendly language. The LLM could also help in creating personalized home exercise programs based on the patient's condition and needs. However, the task also involves a significant level of human interaction, understanding the patient's physical condition, and adapting instructions based on individual needs and progress, which may require physical demonstrations and hands-on guidance. While the LLM can assist in generating written instructions, it may not be able to fully replace the personalized and interactive nature of the guidance provided by a physical therapist.
