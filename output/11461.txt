1: In this task, a nanny is required to perform first aid or CPR when necessary. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes for a nanny to complete this task with equivalent quality. 

Performing first aid or CPR involves practical, hands-on skills that require physical interaction and immediate response. These actions cannot be effectively replaced by text-based instructions or guidance from an LLM. The task also involves critical, time-sensitive decisions that impact human life, which cannot be delegated to an AI model. Therefore, the task of performing first aid or CPR falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM.
