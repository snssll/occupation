1: In this task, a locomotive engineer receives starting signals from conductors and uses controls to drive locomotives. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves operating locomotives based on signals and using controls to drive them. This task is highly physical and involves real-time decision-making based on external signals and conditions. It does not involve text-based inputs or outputs that can be easily processed by an LLM. Additionally, the task requires hands-on operation of machinery, which cannot be automated by an LLM. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of an LLM or any tools built on top of it.
