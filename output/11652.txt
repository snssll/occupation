1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of performing routine maintenance on telecommunications equipment, including adjusting and lubricating components and painting worn or exposed areas, we need to consider the level of automation and assistance that the LLM can provide in completing this task.

- E0: This task involves physical maintenance work that requires hands-on interaction with equipment, such as adjusting, lubricating, and painting. The LLM does not have the capability to physically interact with equipment or perform manual tasks, so it cannot directly assist in completing this task.

- E1: While the LLM can provide information on routine maintenance procedures, such as guidelines for adjusting components or lubricating equipment, it cannot physically perform the maintenance tasks itself. The task of adjusting, lubricating, and painting worn areas involves manual labor that cannot be directly replaced by the LLM.

- E2: It is conceivable that specialized software could be developed on top of the LLM to provide step-by-step guidance for performing routine maintenance tasks on telecommunications equipment. This software could potentially offer interactive tutorials, troubleshooting tips, or virtual simulations to assist technicians in carrying out maintenance procedures more efficiently. However, as of now, such software does not exist, and the LLM alone does not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task.

- E3: The task of performing routine maintenance on telecommunications equipment does not involve image processing or analysis that would benefit from additional image capabilities beyond text-based information provided by the LLM. Therefore, exposure to image capabilities would not significantly impact the completion of this task.
