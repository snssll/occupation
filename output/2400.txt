1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of collecting information and making judgments as an Anthropologist or Archeologist, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be impacted by the use of a large language model (LLM).

- The task involves collecting information through observation, interviews, and document review. An LLM could potentially assist in summarizing documents, generating interview questions, or providing insights based on existing knowledge.
- The LLM could help in organizing and analyzing the collected data, generating reports, or even suggesting potential areas for further investigation based on the information gathered.
- While the LLM may not directly replace the need for observation or interviews, it can significantly enhance the efficiency of information processing and decision-making in this field.

Based on these considerations, the task of collecting information and making judgments as an Anthropologist or Archeologist could be classified as E2 - Exposure by LLM-powered applications.
