1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of developing new styles and techniques as a Hairdresser, Hairstylist, or Cosmetologist, we need to consider how the task can be completed with the help of an LLM.

- Hairdressers, Hairstylists, and Cosmetologists typically rely on their creativity, knowledge of trends, and understanding of hair and beauty techniques to develop new styles. While an LLM can provide information on current trends and techniques, it may not have the practical hands-on experience and artistic flair that human professionals bring to the table when creating new styles.

- The task of developing new styles and techniques involves a high degree of creativity, personal touch, and practical application, which may be challenging for an LLM to replicate accurately. The LLM may be able to provide some inspiration or information on popular styles, but the actual creation and implementation of new styles may still heavily rely on human expertise.

- Additionally, the task of developing new styles and techniques may involve physical interactions with clients, understanding their preferences, and adapting styles to suit individual needs, which are aspects that an LLM may not be able to fully capture or replicate.
