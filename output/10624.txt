1: In this task, a Postal Service Clerk is required to obtain signatures from recipients of registered or special delivery mail. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves a straightforward and routine action of obtaining signatures from recipients, which does not require complex decision-making or specialized knowledge beyond the standard procedures followed by Postal Service Clerks. The task is primarily administrative and involves interacting with customers to collect signatures. 

Given that the task does not involve complex data analysis, specialized domain knowledge, or the need for up-to-date information beyond standard postal procedures, it is unlikely that access to an LLM would significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task. The task is more about physical interaction and adherence to established procedures rather than requiring advanced language processing capabilities. Therefore, the task falls under E0 as the use of an LLM or LLM-powered tool would not substantially decrease the time needed to complete the task for an experienced Postal Service Clerk.
