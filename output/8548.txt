1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of investigating instances of illegal tapping into service lines for Control and Valve Installers and Repairers, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be completed with the help of an LLM.

- Control and Valve Installers and Repairers typically investigate instances of illegal tapping by examining service lines, looking for unauthorized connections, and determining the extent of the issue.
- An LLM can assist in providing information on common methods of illegal tapping, regulations related to service line connections, and potential indicators of unauthorized access.
