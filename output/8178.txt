1: For the task of installing repaired parts into equipment or new equipment as a Machinist, the exposure to LLM can be evaluated as follows:

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** The task involves following specific instructions to install parts into equipment, which could potentially be aided by the LLM in providing detailed step-by-step guidance or troubleshooting tips. The LLM could assist in generating text instructions or diagrams to aid in the installation process, reducing the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to provide interactive 3D models or simulations for training purposes. These applications could enhance the Machinist's understanding of the installation process and improve efficiency.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Image capabilities could potentially be used to provide visual aids for the installation process, such as annotated images or diagrams showing the correct placement of parts. This visual assistance could streamline the task and reduce the time required for completion.

Based on the above analysis, the task of installing repaired parts into equipment or new equipment as a Machinist could be best classified as **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications)**.
