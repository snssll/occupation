1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of cleaning bars, work areas, and tables as a bartender, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task itself does not involve complex decision-making, precise measurements, or detailed visuals. It primarily requires physical cleaning and organization, which cannot be automated by the LLM. While the LLM could potentially provide instructions or guidelines on how to clean effectively, it cannot physically perform the cleaning tasks. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not significantly benefit from the use of the LLM.
