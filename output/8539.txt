1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of investigating experimental wind turbines or wind turbine technologies, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves researching and analyzing information related to wind turbines, which can be done by searching for relevant data, understanding technical specifications, and potentially summarizing findings. The LLM can assist in this task by providing information on wind turbine technologies, aerodynamics, production, noise, and load based on existing knowledge within its training data. The model can generate text, summarize documents, and answer questions related to the topic, making it a valuable tool for gathering information and insights.

Considering the task requirements and the LLM's capabilities, this task falls under E1 - Direct exposure. The LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to research and analyze information about wind turbines, providing valuable insights and summaries to support the investigation process.
