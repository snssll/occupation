1: For the task of making or participating in recordings as a musician or singer, the exposure to LLM can be evaluated as follows:

- E0: This task involves physical actions such as playing instruments, singing, and recording audio, which cannot be directly assisted by an LLM. The LLM cannot physically participate in the recording process, so it would not significantly reduce the time it takes for a musician or singer to complete this task.

- E1: While the LLM could potentially assist in writing lyrics, composing music, or providing feedback on recordings, the core task of making or participating in recordings involves physical performance that the LLM cannot directly contribute to. Therefore, the LLM's assistance would not reduce the time it takes to complete this task by at least half.

- E2: It is conceivable that additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to assist musicians and singers in tasks related to recording, such as generating music compositions, suggesting harmonies, or providing creative input. However, the direct act of making or participating in recordings still heavily relies on physical performance, which the LLM alone cannot facilitate.

- E3: The task of making or participating in recordings does not involve image processing or analysis that would benefit from additional image capabilities alongside the LLM. Therefore, this task does not fall under the E3 category.
