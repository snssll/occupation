1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of performing cost-benefit analyses as a Budget Analyst, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be supported by the capabilities of the LLM. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The task involves analyzing financial data, comparing programs, and exploring financing methods. The LLM can assist in providing information on financial concepts, industry trends, and potentially help in structuring the analysis. The LLM can generate text explaining different financial terms, methodologies, and provide insights into various financing options. It can also help in summarizing data for the analysis. Therefore, direct access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM can provide valuable information and insights, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to automate parts of the cost-benefit analysis process. This software could potentially retrieve up-to-date financial data, perform complex calculations, and generate detailed reports based on the analysis conducted by the Budget Analyst. Such software could enhance the efficiency of the analysis process further.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not relevant for this task as it primarily involves financial data analysis and does not require image processing.
