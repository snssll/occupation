1: In this task, a Cabinetmaker or Bench Carpenter is required to produce or assemble components of articles like store fixtures, office equipment, cabinets, or high-grade furniture. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be significantly expedited or improved by using the language model. 

- The task involves physical work such as cutting, shaping, and assembling wood components, which cannot be directly assisted by the LLM.
- While the LLM could potentially provide guidance on design ideas, material selection, or assembly instructions, the task primarily involves hands-on craftsmanship that cannot be fully replaced by text-based assistance.
- The LLM may be able to provide general information on woodworking techniques or furniture design principles, but the practical application of this knowledge in the physical creation of components would still heavily rely on the skills and experience of the Cabinetmaker or Bench Carpenter.
