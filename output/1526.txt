1: In this task, a Highway Maintenance Worker is required to blend compounds to form adhesive mixtures used for marker installation. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves a physical aspect of blending compounds, which cannot be directly performed by an LLM or any software tool. 
- The task does not involve text input or output that can be easily processed by an LLM.
- There are no complex instructions, documents, or data analysis involved that could benefit from the LLM's capabilities.
- The task does not require specialized domain knowledge that an LLM could provide.

Based on these considerations, it is clear that the task of blending compounds for adhesive mixtures does not align with any of the exposure levels in the rubric.
