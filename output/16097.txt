1: In this task, a Photographic Process Worker would typically splice broken or separated film and mount film on reels. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone or with additional software could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality.

- E0: This task involves physical manipulation of film, which cannot be done by the LLM or any software tool. The task requires hands-on work that cannot be replaced by text-based tools.

- E1: While the LLM could potentially provide guidance on how to splice film or mount it on reels through text instructions, it cannot physically perform the task. The task involves manual dexterity and physical handling of film, which the LLM cannot replicate.

- E2: It is conceivable that additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to provide step-by-step visual instructions for splicing film and mounting it on reels. This software could potentially include interactive guides or augmented reality tools to assist in the physical aspects of the task.

- E3: With access to image capabilities, such as a system that can view and create images, the LLM could potentially assist in providing visual aids or diagrams for splicing film and mounting it on reels. However, the LLM itself cannot physically manipulate the film.
