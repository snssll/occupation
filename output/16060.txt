1: In this task, a Forest and Conservation Worker is required to sort tree seedlings based on standard charts or verbal instructions, discarding substandard seedlings. This task involves manual labor and visual inspection, which cannot be directly performed by an LLM. While the LLM could potentially provide information on tree seedling standards or instructions, it cannot physically sort the seedlings. Therefore, this task does not fall under E1, E2, or E3 as it does not involve text input or output that can be processed by the LLM.
