1: In this task, a welder, cutter, solderer, or brazer is required to check grooves, angles, or gap allowances using micrometers, calipers, and precision measuring instruments. This task involves precise measurements and manual inspection, which cannot be effectively automated by an LLM. The LLM does not have the capability to physically interact with objects or take precise measurements. Therefore, this task falls under the E0 category as it does not benefit from the use of an LLM or LLM-powered tools to reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete the task.
