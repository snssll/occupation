1: In this task, the Fishing and Hunting Worker is responsible for overseeing the purchase of supplies, gear, and equipment. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if access to the LLM or LLM-powered tools can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality by at least half.

- E0: This task involves physical actions such as purchasing supplies, gear, and equipment, which cannot be directly assisted by the LLM or LLM-powered tools. The task also does not involve complex decision-making that could be automated by the LLM.

- E1: While the LLM could potentially provide information on the best practices for purchasing supplies, gear, and equipment, the task itself requires physical actions and interactions that cannot be directly replaced by the LLM. The LLM may help with researching products or comparing prices, but the actual purchasing process would still need to be done manually.

- E2: It is conceivable that a specialized software tool could be developed on top of the LLM to streamline the process of researching and selecting supplies, gear, and equipment for fishing and hunting workers. This tool could potentially analyze data, make recommendations based on user input, and provide insights into the best purchasing decisions.

- E3: The task does not involve image capabilities, so access to a system that can view, caption, and create images would not significantly impact the completion of this task.
