1: In this task, providing on-the-job training to new air traffic controllers involves a significant amount of human interaction and hands-on guidance. It requires real-time observation, feedback, and instruction to ensure the new controllers understand and can perform their duties effectively. This task also involves practical demonstrations, simulations, and scenarios that may not be easily replicated or replaced by an LLM. While the LLM could potentially assist in creating training materials or providing theoretical knowledge, the core aspect of on-the-job training for air traffic controllers is highly interactive and practical, making it challenging for the LLM to significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with high quality.
