1: In this task, a Low Vision Therapist, Orientation and Mobility Specialist, or Vision Rehabilitation Therapist assesses clients' functioning in various areas such as vision, orientation and mobility skills, social and emotional issues, cognition, physical abilities, and personal goals. To complete this task, the therapist needs to interact directly with the client, observe their behaviors, ask questions, and conduct assessments. This task involves a high degree of human interaction, observation, and assessment that cannot be effectively replaced by an LLM or any tool built on top of it. The therapist needs to gather nuanced information, interpret non-verbal cues, and provide personalized recommendations based on their expertise and the client's specific needs. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it cannot be significantly expedited or improved by the use of an LLM or LLM-powered tool.
