1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of decontaminating objects as a Nuclear Technician, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be impacted by the capabilities of the LLM.

- Decontaminating objects involves physical actions such as cleaning with soap or solvents, using brushes, buffing machines, or sandblasting machines. These actions require manual dexterity and the ability to handle equipment effectively.
- The task does not involve complex decision-making, analysis of large amounts of data, or specialized knowledge that the LLM could significantly assist with.
- While the LLM could potentially provide information on decontamination methods or safety procedures, the actual decontamination process itself is hands-on and cannot be directly performed by the LLM.

Based on these considerations, the task of decontaminating objects as a Nuclear Technician would be classified as E0 - No exposure to the LLM.
