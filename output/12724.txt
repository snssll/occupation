In this case, the task involves writing reports based on student and activity data, which can be accomplished by generating text based on provided information.

- E1: Direct exposure - The task of preparing reports involves transforming data into written reports, a task that the LLM can assist with by generating text based on the input data. The LLM can help in writing and transforming text according to complex instructions, which aligns with the requirements of this task.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the task may not require additional specialized software beyond the LLM itself, it is easy to imagine that software could be developed on top of the LLM to streamline the process of report generation further. This could include features like summarizing data, organizing information, and generating insights to enhance the report-writing process.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not relevant to this task as it primarily involves working with text data to prepare reports on students and activities.
