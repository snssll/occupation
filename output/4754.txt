1: In this task, a Purchasing Manager is responsible for developing and implementing purchasing and contract management instructions, policies, and procedures. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- Developing purchasing and contract management instructions, policies, and procedures involves a significant amount of writing and structuring of text-based information.
- The task may require research and analysis to ensure that the instructions, policies, and procedures are comprehensive and effective.
- The task does not involve any visual elements or detailed image processing.
- The task relies heavily on written communication and documentation.

Given these considerations, the task of developing and implementing purchasing and contract management instructions, policies, and procedures aligns closely with tasks that can be completed using an LLM. The LLM can assist in generating, refining, and structuring text-based information, as well as providing insights and recommendations based on the input data. Therefore, this task falls under the E1 label as the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality by at least half.
