1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of filing data and maintaining databases as a Statistical Assistant, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves organizing data, updating databases, and ensuring information is accurate and accessible. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM can assist in writing and transforming text, providing edits, maintaining records of written data, and informing others of information. In this case, the LLM could potentially help in organizing and updating databases by generating text for data entries or providing instructions on how to structure the database. However, the task may require more specialized knowledge or technical skills beyond what the LLM can provide on its own.
  
- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time to complete the task, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to streamline database maintenance. This software could potentially automate data entry, perform quality checks, or suggest improvements to database structures based on the information provided.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities would not significantly impact the task of filing data and maintaining databases, as it primarily involves text-based information rather than visual content.
