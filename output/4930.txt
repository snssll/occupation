1: In this task, a Database Architect is required to develop load-balancing processes to eliminate downtime for backup processes. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can benefit from the capabilities of the LLM.

- E1: Direct exposure - The task involves developing load-balancing processes, which may require writing and transforming text and code according to complex instructions. The LLM can assist in generating code snippets, providing insights on load-balancing techniques, and helping in the documentation of the processes. Therefore, direct access to the LLM could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone can provide valuable insights and assistance in developing load-balancing processes, additional software built on top of the LLM could further enhance the efficiency of the task. For example, specialized tools could be developed to analyze existing data and recommend specific load-balancing strategies based on the organization's requirements.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not directly relevant to the task of developing load-balancing processes for backup systems. Therefore, this task does not fall under E3.
