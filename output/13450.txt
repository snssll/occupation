1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of providing regulatory guidance as a Regulatory Affairs Manager, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be supported by the capabilities of the LLM. In this task, the Regulatory Affairs Manager needs to offer guidance on regulatory requirements for product design, development, evaluation, or marketing. The LLM can assist in providing information on existing regulations, guidelines, and best practices in various industries. It can also help in drafting communication materials or reports related to regulatory compliance. However, the task may involve a high level of domain-specific knowledge and interpretation of complex regulations, which may require human judgment and expertise beyond what the LLM can provide. While the LLM can offer general information and support in drafting documents, the task may still heavily rely on the manager's experience and specialized knowledge in regulatory affairs.
