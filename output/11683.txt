1: In this task, a Parking Enforcement Worker is required to perform simple vehicle maintenance procedures such as checking oil and gas and reporting mechanical problems to supervisors. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves basic vehicle maintenance procedures, which do not require complex decision-making or specialized domain knowledge beyond what a typical worker in this role would possess.
- The task does not involve writing, summarizing documents, analyzing data, or any other text-based activities that could benefit significantly from the capabilities of an LLM.
- While an LLM could potentially provide information on basic vehicle maintenance procedures, the task itself is more practical and hands-on, involving physical tasks like checking oil and gas levels.
- The task does not involve detailed measurements, precise technical knowledge, or specialized domain expertise that would require advanced tools beyond what an LLM can offer.

Based on these considerations, the task of performing simple vehicle maintenance procedures and reporting mechanical problems to supervisors is best classified as E0 - No exposure.
