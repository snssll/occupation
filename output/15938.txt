1: For the task of shoveling, sweeping, or cleaning work areas as a Team Assembler, it is unlikely that access to the LLM would significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task. This task involves physical labor and manual work that cannot be automated by the LLM. The LLM does not have the capability to perform physical tasks such as shoveling or sweeping. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not benefit from the use of the LLM or any LLM-powered tools.
