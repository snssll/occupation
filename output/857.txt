1: In this task, a Helper in Installation, Maintenance, and Repair Workers is required to apply protective materials to equipment, components, and parts to prevent defects and corrosion. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it. 

- E0: This task involves physical work that requires manual dexterity and the ability to work with equipment and materials in a hands-on manner. The task does not involve text-based instructions or data analysis that could be significantly expedited by the LLM.

- E1: The LLM could potentially assist in providing written instructions on the types of protective materials to use, the application techniques, and safety precautions. It could also help in generating documentation related to the protective materials and their properties. However, the actual application of the protective materials is a hands-on task that cannot be directly performed by the LLM.

- E2: While the LLM alone may not reduce the time it takes to complete the task significantly, additional software could be developed to provide detailed guidance on the selection of protective materials, application methods, and safety protocols. This software could leverage the LLM's capabilities to generate comprehensive manuals or instructional materials for workers to follow.

- E3: The task does not involve image processing or analysis that would benefit from image capabilities in conjunction with the LLM. Therefore, this task does not fall under E3.
