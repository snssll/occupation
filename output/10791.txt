1: In this task, the occupation of Helpers--Electricians involves operating heavy equipment like backhoes. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM or LLM-powered tools can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete the task with high quality by at least half. 

Operating heavy equipment like backhoes requires physical skills, training, and on-site presence. This task involves hands-on work that cannot be replaced by text-based instructions or information provided by the LLM. The LLM does not have the capability to physically operate heavy equipment or interact with the physical world. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not meet the criteria for exposure to LLM.
