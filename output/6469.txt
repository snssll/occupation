1: In this task, a Child, Family, and School Social Worker is required to evaluate the personal characteristics and home conditions of foster home or adoption applicants. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could assist in completing it. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM could potentially assist in generating evaluation criteria, drafting reports based on the information provided, or even suggesting questions to ask during interviews with applicants. It could also help in summarizing information gathered during evaluations. However, the task involves assessing personal characteristics and home conditions, which may require physical visits and observations that the LLM cannot perform. Therefore, while the LLM can aid in certain aspects of the task, it may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the evaluation process.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM could be used to analyze and summarize information provided by applicants, it may not have access to up-to-date information about the applicants' personal characteristics or home conditions unless explicitly provided in the input. Developing additional software that integrates with the LLM to retrieve and analyze such information could potentially enhance the efficiency of the evaluation process. However, the task's reliance on real-world observations and interactions may limit the extent to which the LLM alone can streamline the evaluation of foster home or adoption applicants.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - This task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images, so the image capabilities of the LLM would not significantly impact the completion of the task.
