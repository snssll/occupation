1: In this task, a glazier is required to drive trucks to installation sites and unload mirrors, glass equipment, or tools. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves physical actions such as driving trucks and unloading equipment, which cannot be directly performed by an LLM. The task does not involve complex text input or output, and the expertise required is more related to physical labor rather than information processing. Therefore, the task does not align with the capabilities of an LLM, and there are no tools built on top of the LLM that could significantly reduce the time to complete the task. As a result, this task falls under E0 as it does not benefit from exposure to an LLM.
