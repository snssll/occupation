1: In this task, a bailiff is responsible for checking the courtroom for security and cleanliness, as well as ensuring the availability of sundry supplies like notepads for use by the judge, jurors, and attorneys. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if access to the LLM or LLM-powered tools can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality.

- Direct exposure (E1): The task involves physical inspection of the courtroom for security and cleanliness, which cannot be directly assisted by the LLM. Additionally, ensuring the availability of supplies like notepads may require physical interaction and management, which is beyond the capabilities of the LLM. Therefore, direct access to the LLM would not reduce the time significantly for completing this task.

- Exposure by LLM-powered applications (E2): While it is conceivable that software could be developed to assist with inventory management of supplies, it is unlikely that such software would significantly reduce the time it takes to physically check the courtroom for security and cleanliness. The task is more operational and hands-on, which may not benefit greatly from LLM-powered applications.

- Exposure given image capabilities (E3): Image capabilities would not be relevant for this task as it primarily involves physical inspection and management of supplies in a courtroom setting. The task does not require reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images.
