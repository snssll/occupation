1: In this task, a Payroll and Timekeeping Clerk is responsible for preparing and filing payroll tax returns. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM can assist in completing it. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM can assist in providing guidance on the specific requirements for preparing and filing payroll tax returns. It can help generate accurate calculations, provide templates, and offer explanations on tax laws and regulations related to payroll. The LLM can also assist in drafting the necessary documentation for filing tax returns.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to automate the process of preparing and filing payroll tax returns. This software could integrate with tax filing systems, perform data validation checks, and streamline the overall process.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not relevant to the task of preparing and filing payroll tax returns, as it primarily involves dealing with numerical data and legal documentation rather than visual information.
