1: In this task, a Petroleum Pump System Operator, Refinery Operator, or Gauger is required to patrol units to monitor the amount of oil in storage tanks and ensure that activities are safe, efficient, and compliant with regulations. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality.

- Direct exposure (E1): The task involves physical monitoring and inspection of oil storage tanks, which cannot be directly assisted by the LLM. The LLM cannot physically patrol units or verify the safety and compliance of operations on-site. Therefore, direct access to the LLM would not reduce the time it takes to complete this task by at least half.

- Exposure by LLM-powered applications (E2): While the LLM could potentially provide information on regulations, safety procedures, or efficiency practices related to oil storage and operations, it cannot physically patrol units or verify compliance on-site. Developing additional software on top of the LLM that could assist in monitoring oil levels or safety compliance in real-time would be complex and likely not feasible. Therefore, the LLM alone would not significantly reduce the time to complete this task by half.

- Exposure given image capabilities (E3): Image capabilities would not be relevant for this task as it involves physical monitoring and inspection of oil storage tanks on-site, which cannot be replaced by image processing. The task requires direct physical presence and action, which cannot be facilitated by image capabilities.
