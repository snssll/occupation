1: In this task, a Weatherization Installer or Technician is responsible for installing storm windows or storm doors and ensuring they fit correctly. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves physical installation work that requires hands-on skills and precise measurements. This task does not involve complex written instructions, text transformation, or data analysis that could be significantly expedited by an LLM.
- The task does not involve accessing up-to-date information or specialized domain knowledge that an LLM could provide.
- While an LLM could potentially assist in generating written instructions or documentation related to the installation process, the core task of physically installing storm windows or doors and verifying their fit is not something an LLM can directly perform.

Based on these considerations, the task of installing storm windows or storm doors and verifying proper fit is best classified as E0 - No exposure to LLM.
