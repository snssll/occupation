1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of evaluating transportation-related consequences of federal or state legislative proposals for Transportation Planners, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could assist in completing it. 

- E1: Direct exposure - If the task involves analyzing text from legislative proposals, summarizing key points, and providing insights into transportation-related consequences, the LLM could significantly reduce the time needed to process and understand the information. The LLM can help in extracting relevant details, generating summaries, and offering insights based on the input text.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not reduce the time by half for this task, additional software could be developed to enhance the process. For example, a specialized tool could be created to automatically extract transportation-related information from legislative proposals, analyze the impact, and provide recommendations based on the data processed by the LLM.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Since the task primarily involves text analysis of legislative proposals, image capabilities are not directly relevant in this context. Therefore, this task does not fall under E3.
