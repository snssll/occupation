1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of preparing cost estimates or specifications for rehabilitation or weatherization services as a Weatherization Installer or Technician, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be aided by the use of a large language model (LLM).

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** Using an LLM directly could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task. The LLM can assist in generating detailed cost estimates based on input specifications, historical data, and other relevant information. It can also help in drafting comprehensive specifications for the services required, ensuring accuracy and completeness.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While an LLM alone may not reduce the time by half for this task, additional software built on top of the LLM could enhance the process. For instance, specialized applications could be developed to extract and analyze data from various sources to provide more accurate cost estimates and specifications, integrating real-time pricing information and industry standards.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Image capabilities are not directly relevant to this task as it primarily involves preparing cost estimates and specifications, which are text-based activities. Therefore, image capabilities would not significantly impact the completion time for this task.
