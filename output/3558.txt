1: In this task, a Customer Service Representative is required to contact customers to respond to inquiries or provide updates on claim investigations or adjustments. With the help of the LLM, the representative could potentially draft responses to common inquiries, draft scripts for communicating claim investigation results, or even generate templates for notifying customers of planned adjustments. The LLM could assist in crafting clear and professional communication tailored to the specific needs of each customer. This task involves writing and transforming text according to specific instructions, which aligns with the capabilities of the LLM.

Considering the nature of the task and the potential for the LLM to significantly reduce the time it takes to prepare responses and notifications, I would classify this task as E1. The LLM can streamline the process of drafting communication materials, ensuring accuracy and professionalism in customer interactions.
