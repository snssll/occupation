1: To determine the appropriate exposure label for the task of determining photovoltaic (PV) system designs or configurations as a Solar Photovoltaic Installer, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can benefit from the use of a large language model (LLM).

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** If the task involves analyzing customer needs, expectations, and site conditions and generating system designs or configurations based on this information, the LLM could assist in providing recommendations, generating design proposals, or even suggesting optimal configurations based on input criteria. The LLM could help in transforming text inputs describing customer requirements and site conditions into actionable system designs.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time to complete the task, additional software built on top of the LLM could enhance the process. For instance, specialized software could be developed to integrate real-time data on solar panel efficiency, pricing, and availability to recommend the most cost-effective and efficient system designs based on the latest information.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** This task does not involve detailed image analysis or creation, so the image capabilities of the LLM would not significantly impact the completion time for determining PV system designs.
