1: In this task, a Gem and Diamond Worker is required to immerse stones in prescribed chemical solutions to determine specific gravities and key properties of gemstones or substitutes. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM could significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality. 

- Direct exposure (E1): The task involves physical manipulation of stones and chemical solutions, which cannot be directly replaced by the LLM. The LLM cannot perform physical tasks or interact with physical objects, so it cannot directly assist in immersing stones in chemical solutions.

- Exposure by LLM-powered applications (E2): While the LLM could potentially provide information on gemstones, their properties, and chemical solutions, it cannot physically immerse stones in solutions. However, it could assist in providing information on specific gravities and properties based on input data.

- Exposure given image capabilities (E3): Image capabilities would not significantly aid in this task as it involves chemical processes and physical manipulation of stones, which cannot be captured through images.

Considering the limitations of the LLM in physically interacting with objects and performing chemical tasks, the task of immersing stones in chemical solutions is not suitable for any of the exposure labels provided.
