1: In this task, the Rotary Drill Operator is responsible for positioning and preparing truck-mounted derricks at drilling areas specified on field maps. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves physical actions such as positioning and preparing equipment, which cannot be directly performed by an LLM.
- The task requires hands-on work with machinery, which is not something an LLM can assist with.
- The task involves following specific field maps and instructions, which may not be directly related to text-based inputs that an LLM can process.
- The task does not involve complex data analysis, decision-making, or information retrieval that would significantly benefit from LLM capabilities.

Based on these considerations, it is clear that the task of positioning and preparing truck-mounted derricks at drilling areas specified on field maps falls under the E0 category as it does not align with the capabilities of an LLM.

2: E0
