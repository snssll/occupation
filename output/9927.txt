1: In this task, a Rehabilitation Counselor is required to monitor and record clients' progress to ensure that goals and objectives are met. This involves tracking and documenting the clients' advancements, setbacks, and overall progress towards their rehabilitation goals. With the help of a large language model (LLM), the counselor could potentially streamline the process of recording and monitoring by quickly generating progress reports, updating client files, and organizing data efficiently. The LLM could assist in summarizing client progress, highlighting key achievements or areas needing improvement, and even suggesting interventions based on the recorded information. Overall, the LLM could significantly reduce the time and effort required to maintain accurate and up-to-date client records.

Considering the nature of the task and the potential for the LLM to automate and enhance the monitoring and recording process, I would classify this task as E1 - Direct exposure.
