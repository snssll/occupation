1: Critical Care Nurses assist physicians with procedures such as bronchoscopy, endoscopy, endotracheal intubation, or elective cardioversion. This task involves hands-on medical procedures that require physical presence, precise movements, and real-time decision-making based on patient conditions. The task does not involve text-based or data-driven activities that could be significantly enhanced by the use of an LLM. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM or any tools built on top of it.
