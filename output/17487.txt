1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of uploading digital images onto websites for customers as a Photographic Process Worker, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. In this task, the LLM could potentially assist in generating text descriptions for the images, providing guidance on image optimization for web use, or even suggesting website layout improvements for better image presentation. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM can assist in writing text descriptions, optimizing images, and providing guidance on website layout, all of which are text-based tasks that can be completed with the LLM's capabilities.
- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not reduce the time significantly for this task, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to automate the image uploading process, integrate with content management systems, or provide real-time feedback on image quality.
- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - The task involves working with digital images, and if the LLM had image capabilities to view, caption, and create images, it could potentially assist in image editing, resizing, or even suggesting image enhancements for web use.
