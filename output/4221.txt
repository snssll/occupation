1: In this task, the Chief Executive is required to deliver speeches, write articles, or present information at meetings or conventions to promote services, exchange ideas, or accomplish objectives. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves generating written content (speeches, articles) and presenting information verbally. An LLM could assist in generating speech drafts, writing articles, and potentially providing suggestions for presentation content. The model could also help in refining language, structuring arguments, and ensuring clarity in communication. However, the task also involves the delivery of speeches and presentations, which require human presence, voice modulation, body language, and interaction with the audience. While the LLM can assist in preparing the written content, it cannot replace the live delivery aspect of the task. Therefore, the task falls under E2 as having access to the LLM alone may not reduce the time significantly, but additional software could be developed to aid in speech delivery and presentation skills.
