1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of developing natural resource management plans as an Environmental Restoration Planner, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it. 

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** The task involves synthesizing knowledge of environmental planning and regulatory requirements to develop management plans. The LLM could assist in providing information on specific environmental regulations, guidelines, and best practices. It could also help in drafting sections of the plan, providing insights on environmental impact assessments, and suggesting strategies for sustainable resource management. Overall, the LLM could significantly reduce the time it takes to gather relevant information and draft sections of the plan, enhancing the efficiency of the planner.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the LLM alone can provide valuable information and assist in drafting sections of the plan, additional software could be developed to streamline the process further. This software could potentially analyze large datasets related to environmental planning, generate detailed recommendations based on real-time environmental data, and offer insights into complex regulatory frameworks. By combining the capabilities of the LLM with specialized environmental databases and analytical tools, the efficiency of developing natural resource management plans could be further enhanced.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Image capabilities would not significantly impact the task of developing natural resource management plans, as the core requirements involve knowledge of environmental planning and regulatory compliance rather than visual data processing.
