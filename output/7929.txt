1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of inspecting or evaluating building systems to determine energy consumption as an Energy Auditor, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves analyzing and evaluating technical systems, which may require specialized knowledge and expertise in energy efficiency and building systems. The LLM can assist in providing general information on energy audits, definitions, and basic principles related to energy consumption. However, the task also involves practical on-site inspections and detailed analysis of building systems, which may require hands-on experience and specialized technical knowledge that the LLM may not possess. While the LLM can provide some general guidance and information, it may not significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced Energy Auditor to complete the task with high quality.
