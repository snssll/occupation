1: In this task, a Sales Engineer is required to attend trade shows and seminars to promote products or learn about industry developments. With access to the LLM, the Sales Engineer could potentially use the model to research and prepare for the trade shows and seminars by gathering information about the products they are promoting or the latest industry developments. The LLM could help in summarizing key points, generating questions to ask at the events, or even drafting promotional materials. However, the task itself involves physical presence at the trade shows and seminars, which cannot be directly substituted by the LLM. While the LLM can assist in preparation and follow-up tasks, it cannot attend the events on behalf of the Sales Engineer.
