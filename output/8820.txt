1: In this task, the Computer Numerically Controlled (CNC) Tool Operators are responsible for lifting workpieces to machines manually or with hoists or cranes. This task involves physical labor and manual handling of materials, which cannot be directly assisted by the LLM. The LLM does not have the capability to physically interact with objects or perform tasks that require physical strength. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM or any tools built on top of it.
