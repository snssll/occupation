1: In this task, the Athletic Trainer is required to apply protective or injury preventive devices to body parts. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if the task can be significantly expedited or improved by using the LLM. The task involves physical interaction and hands-on application of devices, which cannot be directly assisted by the LLM. The LLM cannot physically apply tape, bandages, or braces to body parts. Therefore, the task does not fall under E1, E2, or E3 as the LLM cannot directly assist in completing the task.

2: E0
