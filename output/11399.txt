1: In this task, an Occupational Therapy Aide is required to perform clerical, administrative, and secretarial duties such as answering phones, restocking and ordering supplies, filling out paperwork, and scheduling appointments. These tasks involve a significant amount of written communication and organization. With the help of the LLM, the aide could potentially automate certain aspects of their administrative tasks, such as drafting emails, filling out paperwork, or even scheduling appointments. The LLM could assist in generating responses to common phone inquiries or drafting supply order requests. Overall, the LLM could streamline the administrative processes and save time for the Occupational Therapy Aide.

Considering the nature of the task and the potential for the LLM to significantly reduce the time it takes to complete these administrative duties with equivalent quality, I would classify this task as E1.
