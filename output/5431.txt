1: In this task, a First-Line Supervisor of Retail Sales Workers is required to direct and supervise employees engaged in various activities related to retail sales. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality. The task involves overseeing and managing retail operations, which requires human interaction, decision-making, and real-time monitoring of activities. While the LLM can provide general guidance on supervisory tasks and offer suggestions, it cannot replace the need for direct human supervision and interaction in a retail setting. Therefore, the task falls under E0 as it does not clearly decrease the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete the task with high quality by at least half.

2: E0

3: High
