1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of keeping abreast of new biochemistries, instrumentation, or software by reading scientific literature and attending professional conferences as a Bioinformatics Scientist, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The LLM can assist in summarizing medium-length documents, providing feedback on documents, answering questions about documents, and generating questions a user might want to ask about a document. However, the task of staying updated on new biochemistries, instrumentation, or software involves more than just reading and summarizing text. It requires understanding complex scientific concepts, analyzing data, and potentially interacting with experts in the field. While the LLM can help with some aspects of this task, such as summarizing relevant literature, it may not be able to fully replace the expertise and experience needed to stay current in the rapidly evolving field of bioinformatics. Therefore, this task falls under E2 - Exposure by LLM-powered applications, as additional software could potentially be developed to assist in summarizing and analyzing scientific literature more efficiently.
