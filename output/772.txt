1: In this task, the roofer is responsible for applying alternate layers of hot asphalt or tar and roofing paper to roofs. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves physical labor and hands-on work that cannot be directly performed by an LLM. The task requires manual dexterity, physical strength, and the ability to work at heights, which are not capabilities of the LLM. Additionally, the task involves working with materials like hot asphalt and roofing paper, which are not within the scope of what an LLM can handle. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it cannot be significantly aided by the LLM or any tools built on top of it.
