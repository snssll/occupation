1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of determining meal prices based on ingredient prices for the occupation of Cooks, Institution and Cafeteria, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. In this case, the task involves calculations based on ingredient prices, which can be a straightforward mathematical process. The LLM can assist in providing information on ingredient prices, performing calculations, and potentially even suggesting pricing strategies based on trends or market data. However, the task does not involve complex decision-making, specialized domain knowledge, or detailed data analysis beyond basic calculations. Therefore, the LLM's assistance in this task would not significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete it with high quality. As such, this task falls under E0 as the LLM alone would not provide a substantial time-saving benefit.
