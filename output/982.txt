1: In this task, a real estate broker is responsible for arranging title searches of properties being sold. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be completed more efficiently with the help of the language model. 

- Real estate brokers typically need to coordinate with title companies to conduct title searches, which involve verifying the ownership history and any existing liens on a property. This task involves a lot of administrative work and communication with various parties.

- While the LLM could potentially assist in drafting emails or summarizing information related to title searches, the core task of arranging for title searches involves practical coordination and communication that may not be significantly enhanced by the language model alone.

- The LLM may not have direct access to the necessary databases or systems to actually conduct the title searches, as this task requires specialized knowledge and access to real estate databases.
