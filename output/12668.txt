1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of preparing periodic reports on court proceedings as required by Judicial Law Clerks, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it. 

- E1: Direct exposure - If the task involves writing and transforming text based on complex instructions, providing edits to existing text following specifications, or summarizing medium-length documents, the LLM could significantly reduce the time needed to complete the task with equivalent quality. In this case, the LLM could help in summarizing court proceedings, drafting reports, and ensuring accuracy in the content.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the task may not be directly reducible to writing or summarizing text, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to assist in summarizing court proceedings, extracting key information, and generating reports more efficiently. This software could potentially leverage the LLM's capabilities to analyze and synthesize information from court proceedings.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Since the task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images, the image capabilities of the LLM are not directly relevant to this task.

Based on the above considerations, the task of preparing periodic reports on court proceedings as required by Judicial Law Clerks could be best classified as E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications.
