1: In this task, a Software Quality Assurance Analyst and Tester is required to visit beta testing sites to evaluate software performance. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we can break down the task:
- The task involves evaluating software performance at beta testing sites, which may require analyzing user feedback, testing software functionalities, and identifying bugs or issues.
- The LLM could potentially assist in preparing evaluation criteria, generating test cases, or even providing insights on common software performance issues to look out for.
- While the LLM could help in generating some documentation or checklists for the evaluation process, it may not significantly reduce the time it takes to physically visit and evaluate software performance at beta testing sites.
- The task does not involve detailed visual analysis, precise measurements, or human interaction that would require an E0 label.

Based on the analysis, the task could be classified as E2 - Exposure by LLM-powered applications, as additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to streamline the evaluation process, provide recommendations based on data, or assist in analyzing software performance metrics.
