1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of locating guests to appear on talk or interview shows as a Broadcast Announcer or Radio Disc Jockey, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves researching and identifying potential guests who would be suitable for specific shows. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM can assist in generating a list of potential guests based on criteria provided by the announcer or disc jockey. It can search for relevant information about individuals and their expertise, helping to streamline the guest selection process.
- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time it takes to locate guests, additional software could be developed to integrate with the LLM. This software could automate the process of identifying and contacting potential guests based on predefined criteria, leveraging the LLM's capabilities for information retrieval and communication.
- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not relevant for this task as it primarily involves text-based research and communication, rather than image processing.

Considering the task's nature and the potential for automation and assistance in information retrieval and communication, the task aligns best with E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications.
