1: In this task, a Tool and Die Maker is responsible for cutting, shaping, and trimming blanks or blocks to specified lengths or shapes using various tools. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone or with additional software could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality.

- Direct exposure (E1): The task involves physical manipulation of materials and tools, which cannot be directly assisted by the LLM. While the LLM could potentially provide information on techniques, safety guidelines, or tool specifications, it cannot physically perform the cutting, shaping, or trimming required for this task. Therefore, direct exposure to the LLM would not reduce the time significantly.

- Exposure by LLM-powered applications (E2): It is conceivable that additional software could be developed to provide guidance on specific cutting techniques, tool maintenance, or troubleshooting common issues faced by Tool and Die Makers. This software could potentially offer recommendations based on general knowledge in the field. However, the physical nature of the task limits the extent to which the LLM alone could reduce the time it takes to complete the task by half.

- Exposure given image capabilities (E3): Image capabilities would not significantly impact the completion of this task, as it primarily involves physical actions with tools and materials. The task does not require reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images, which are scenarios where image capabilities would be beneficial.

Considering the limitations of the task involving physical manipulation of materials and tools, the most appropriate exposure label is E0.

2: E0

3: High
