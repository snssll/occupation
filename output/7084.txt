1: In this task, an acupuncturist is required to formulate herbal preparations to treat conditions, taking into account various factors such as herbal properties, taste, toxicity, effects of preparation, contraindications, and incompatibilities. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider whether the LLM can assist in providing information on herbal properties, contraindications, and other related factors. The LLM can potentially help by providing information on herbal properties, contraindications, and effects of herbal preparations based on existing knowledge and research. It can also assist in generating formulations based on the input criteria. However, the task involves a high level of specialized knowledge in herbal medicine, which may not be fully covered by the LLM alone. While the LLM can provide general information, it may not have access to highly specialized domain knowledge specific to herbal medicine.
