1: In this task, a Real Estate Sales Agent is required to appraise properties to determine loan values. To complete this task, the agent needs to have a good understanding of the real estate market, property values, and factors that influence property prices. The task involves analyzing various aspects of a property, such as location, size, condition, and comparable sales in the area. The agent also needs to consider economic factors and trends that may impact property values.

When considering the exposure rubric, this task falls under the category of requiring domain-specific knowledge and expertise in real estate. While the LLM can provide general information and insights, it may not have access to up-to-date real estate market data or specific property details required for accurate property appraisals. The task also involves a level of judgment and interpretation that may be better suited for a human with specialized knowledge in real estate.
