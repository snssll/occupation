1: In this task, an Instructional Coordinator is required to recommend changes to curricula or delivery methods based on various factors such as instructional effectiveness data, performance requirements, feasibility, and costs. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be significantly aided by the capabilities of the LLM. The LLM can assist in analyzing instructional effectiveness data, providing insights into current performance requirements, feasibility, and potentially even costs based on existing data and trends. The model can also generate recommendations based on the input data and criteria provided. However, the task may involve highly specialized domain knowledge and nuanced understanding of educational practices, which the LLM alone may not possess. While the LLM can provide valuable insights and recommendations, it may not fully replace the expertise and experience of an Instructional Coordinator in making complex decisions about curricula and delivery methods.
