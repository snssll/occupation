1: In this task, a cardiologist is required to operate diagnostic imaging equipment to produce contrast-enhanced radiographs of the heart and cardiovascular system. This task involves specialized medical knowledge, technical skills, and the ability to interpret the images obtained. While an LLM could potentially provide information on the process of operating diagnostic imaging equipment or the interpretation of radiographs, it cannot physically operate the equipment or capture the images. The task also involves real-time decision-making based on the images obtained, which is beyond the capabilities of the LLM. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it requires hands-on expertise and cannot be significantly expedited by the LLM alone.

2: E0
