1: In this task, a Grinding and Polishing Worker, Hand is responsible for cleaning brass particles from files by drawing file cards through file grooves. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves manual labor and physical interaction with tools, specifically drawing file cards through file grooves to clean brass particles. This task does not involve text input or output, complex instructions, data analysis, or any other activity that can be directly facilitated by an LLM. As such, there is no direct exposure to LLM capabilities that can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task. Additionally, developing software on top of the LLM to automate this physical cleaning process is not feasible. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM or any potential software built on top of it.
