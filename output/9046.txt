1: In this task, a Loan Officer is responsible for maintaining and reviewing account records, updating and recategorizing them based on status changes. With the help of the LLM, the officer can potentially automate the process of reviewing and updating account records by generating scripts or codes to handle the data management tasks efficiently. The LLM can assist in summarizing the changes in account status, providing insights into trends, and even suggesting actions based on the data. This task involves working with text data and making decisions based on the information available in the records, which aligns well with the capabilities of the LLM.

Considering the nature of the task and the potential for the LLM to significantly reduce the time required to maintain and review account records, I would classify this task as E1 - Direct exposure.

2: E1

3: Moderate
