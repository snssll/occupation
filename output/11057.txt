1: In this task, a Phlebotomist is responsible for organizing and cleaning blood-drawing trays to ensure the instruments are sterile and ready for use. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves specific instructions related to organizing and cleaning equipment, which can be effectively communicated through text. The task does not require specialized domain knowledge beyond standard procedures in phlebotomy. The LLM can assist in providing detailed instructions on how to organize and clean the trays, including information on sterilization techniques and best practices. The model can also generate a checklist of items needed for the trays and provide guidance on ensuring all instruments are of first-time use. Overall, the task can be completed more efficiently with the LLM's assistance, reducing the time required for a Phlebotomist to perform this task.
