1: Administering welfare programs as a Child, Family, and School Social Worker involves tasks such as assessing the needs of families, providing support services, and ensuring families receive the assistance they require. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider whether the task can be significantly expedited or improved by using the LLM. In this case, the task involves practical, hands-on work that requires direct interaction with families and individuals to assess their needs and provide support. While the LLM could potentially assist in generating written materials or resources related to welfare programs, the core aspect of administering these programs involves human interaction, decision-making, and implementation that cannot be effectively replaced by the LLM alone. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not significantly benefit from LLM capabilities.
