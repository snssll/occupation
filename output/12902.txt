1: In this task, an Acute Care Nurse is required to prescribe medications to patients and observe their reactions, modifying prescriptions as needed. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves a high level of expertise and knowledge in healthcare, particularly in medication management and patient care.
- The task requires understanding patient conditions, medication interactions, and potential side effects.
- The task involves critical decision-making based on patient responses and observations.
- The task may involve legal implications and ethical considerations.

Given these considerations, it is clear that the task of prescribing medications and observing patients' reactions as an Acute Care Nurse falls under the E0 category. This task requires human judgment, expertise, and direct interaction with patients, which cannot be effectively replaced by an LLM or any tool built on top of it.
