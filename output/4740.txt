1: In this task, a First-Line Supervisor of Security Workers is required to develop and document security procedures, policies, or standards. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- Developing security procedures, policies, or standards involves a significant amount of writing and transforming text according to complex instructions. The task may require synthesizing information, providing detailed guidelines, and ensuring clarity in communication.
- The task does not involve any visual elements or require specialized domain knowledge beyond security protocols.
- While the task may benefit from the LLM's ability to generate text and provide guidance, it does not necessarily require image capabilities or specialized databases.

Based on these considerations, the task falls under E1 as the LLM can assist in writing and transforming text according to complex instructions, which is a core aspect of developing and documenting security procedures, policies, or standards.
