1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of advising sellers on how to make homes more appealing to potential buyers as a Real Estate Sales Agent, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. In this task, the LLM can assist in providing guidance on various strategies to enhance the appeal of homes through written text. The model can generate suggestions, tips, and best practices based on general knowledge and trends in the real estate market. It can also help in crafting persuasive language to communicate these recommendations effectively to sellers.

Given that the task involves providing advice and recommendations through written communication, the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to compile a comprehensive list of suggestions and tips for sellers. The model can generate tailored advice based on the specific needs of each property and seller, improving the efficiency of the process.

Considering these factors, the task falls under label E1 - Direct exposure, as direct access to the LLM can reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality by at least half.
