1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of creating and installing special effects as required by the script for Special Effects Artists and Animators, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves a hands-on aspect of mixing chemicals and fabricating parts from various materials, which cannot be directly performed by the LLM. While the LLM could potentially assist in generating ideas for special effects, providing guidance on techniques, or even creating digital visualizations of the effects, it cannot physically mix chemicals or fabricate physical parts. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not significantly benefit from the capabilities of the LLM in reducing the time it takes to complete the task.
