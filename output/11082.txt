1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of overhauling and testing machines or equipment to ensure operating efficiency as a Mobile Heavy Equipment Mechanic, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be aided by the use of a large language model (LLM).

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** If the task involves writing detailed reports, documenting the overhaul and testing process, or communicating findings with colleagues or clients through written reports, the LLM could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete these tasks with equivalent quality. The LLM could assist in generating detailed reports, summarizing key points, or even drafting communication materials related to the equipment's performance.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the task itself may not be directly reducible to text-based interactions, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to streamline the process. For example, an application that can analyze equipment data, provide recommendations for maintenance based on historical data, or even assist in diagnosing complex issues could be developed to complement the work of Mobile Heavy Equipment Mechanics.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Since the task involves working with machines and equipment, having image capabilities could be beneficial for tasks such as viewing schematics, diagrams, or images of equipment components. The LLM could assist in interpreting these images, providing annotations, or even generating reports based on visual data.
