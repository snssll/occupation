1: In this task, the occupation of Fallers involves trimming off the tops and limbs of trees using chainsaws, delimbers, or axes. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality. Given that this task involves physical labor, precise manual work, and potential safety hazards, it is unlikely that the LLM or any tools built on top of it can effectively assist in completing the task. The task requires hands-on skills, physical coordination, and knowledge of tree cutting techniques, which cannot be substituted by text-based AI models.
