1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of writing or modifying design specifications for jewelers and precious stone and metal workers, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be impacted by the use of the LLM. In this case, the task involves creating or adjusting design specifications, which is a text-based activity that requires knowledge of metal contents and weights of items. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM can assist in writing and transforming text according to complex instructions. In this task, the LLM could potentially help in generating or refining design specifications based on the provided metal contents and weights information. The LLM can be used to draft detailed specifications quickly and accurately, reducing the time it takes to complete the task.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone can be helpful in generating text, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to provide more specialized assistance for jewelers and metalworkers. This software could potentially include tools for recommending specific metal combinations based on weights, or providing insights into design trends in the industry.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Since the task primarily involves text-based activities related to design specifications, image capabilities are not directly relevant in this context.
