1: In this task, a substitute teacher is required to attend professional meetings, educational conferences, or teacher training workshops to improve their professional competence. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes for a substitute teacher to attend these events and improve their professional competence. 

- E0: This task involves physical attendance at events, which cannot be replaced by the LLM. The LLM cannot physically attend meetings or workshops on behalf of the substitute teacher.
- E1: The LLM could potentially help by summarizing key points from conferences or workshops, providing insights or questions to ask during these events, or even assisting in preparing for such events by generating relevant questions or information. However, the core task of physically attending these events cannot be directly replaced by the LLM.
- E2: While the LLM could assist in preparing for these events or providing additional information, it cannot fully substitute the need for physical attendance at professional meetings or workshops. However, additional software could potentially be developed to provide more personalized summaries, recommendations, or insights based on the substitute teacher's specific needs and interests.
- E3: The task does not involve image capabilities, so this label does not apply.

Based on the above analysis, the most appropriate label for this task is E1.

2: E1

3: Moderate
