1: In this task, a Patternmaker, Wood is required to lay out patterns on wood stock and draw outlines of units, sectional patterns, or full-scale mock-ups of products based on blueprint specifications and sketches. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it. 

- E0: This task involves physical work such as laying out patterns on wood stock and using marking and measuring devices. The task also requires manual skills and precision that cannot be replicated by the LLM or any software tools. Therefore, this task does not benefit from LLM exposure.

- E1: While the LLM could potentially assist in providing information on blueprint specifications or sketches, the core aspect of laying out patterns on wood stock and drawing outlines requires physical interaction and manual work that cannot be replaced by the LLM. Thus, the LLM alone cannot reduce the time it takes to complete this task by at least half.

- E2: It is conceivable that additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to assist in generating digital mock-ups based on blueprint specifications and sketches. This software could potentially automate some aspects of the pattern layout process, but it would still require human intervention for the physical work involved in working with wood stock and measuring devices.

- E3: The task does not involve image processing or detailed visual analysis that would benefit significantly from image capabilities. Therefore, exposure to image capabilities would not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task.

2: E0
