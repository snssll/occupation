1: In this task, a Physical Therapist Assistant is required to observe patients during treatments, compile and evaluate data on their responses and progress, and provide results to the physical therapist. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves observing patients, compiling data, evaluating progress, and communicating results. These activities are primarily based on direct observation and interaction with patients, which require physical presence and hands-on assessment. While an LLM could potentially assist in generating progress notes based on the data provided, the core aspects of observing patients and evaluating their responses are physical and interactive in nature, making it challenging for the LLM to significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with high quality. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it involves a high degree of human interaction and physical assessment that cannot be effectively replaced by an LLM.
