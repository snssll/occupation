1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of performing crop production duties as an Agricultural Technician, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be impacted by the use of the LLM.

- The task involves physical activities such as tilling, hoeing, pruning, weeding, and harvesting crops, which cannot be directly assisted by the LLM.
- While the LLM can provide information on crop production techniques, pest control, soil management, and other related topics, it cannot physically perform the tasks involved in crop production.
- The LLM could potentially assist in providing written instructions, guidelines, or recommendations for crop production, but the actual execution of the tasks would still require manual labor.
- Since the task primarily involves physical work in the field, it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM to significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task.

Based on these considerations, the task of performing crop production duties as an Agricultural Technician would be classified as E0 - No exposure.
