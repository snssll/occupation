1: For the task of cooking and packaging batches of food as a fast-food cook, the exposure to LLM can be evaluated as follows:

- **E0**: This task involves physical actions such as cooking and packaging food, which cannot be directly assisted by the LLM. The LLM cannot physically cook or package food, so it would not reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task.

- **E1**: The LLM could potentially assist in providing recipes, cooking instructions, or packaging guidelines through text input and output. However, the direct impact on reducing the time to complete the task significantly is limited as the actual cooking and packaging process requires physical actions.

- **E2**: While an application could potentially be developed to provide real-time cooking instructions or suggest optimal packaging methods based on current trends or customer preferences, the task of cooking and packaging food in a fast-food setting may not benefit significantly from the LLM alone.

- **E3**: The task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images, so exposure to image capabilities would not significantly impact the time it takes to complete this task.
