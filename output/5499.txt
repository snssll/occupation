1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of coordinating web-based fundraising activities for Fundraisers, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves managing online platforms for fundraising, which may require writing and transforming text for web content, responding to emails related to donations, and potentially providing feedback on website design or content. The LLM can assist in generating text for web pages, drafting emails, and providing feedback on content. However, it may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task by half, as it does not involve highly specialized domain knowledge or complex databases. Therefore, this task falls under E2, as additional software could potentially be developed to enhance the LLM's capabilities for fundraising activities.
