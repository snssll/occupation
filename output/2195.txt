1: In this task, a Search Marketing Strategist collaborates with design staff to create multimedia websites or internet content that aligns with the brand and company's visual format. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be significantly enhanced by the use of the language model. 

- The task involves collaboration with design staff, which requires human interaction and visual design expertise. LLMs are not well-suited for tasks that involve detailed visual design or require precise measurements, which are crucial in multimedia website creation.
- While the LLM can provide text-based content suggestions or help with written aspects of the website, it may not significantly reduce the time it takes to collaborate with design staff or ensure the visual elements conform to the brand's standards.
- LLMs are not equipped to handle multimedia design tasks, such as creating graphics, animations, or layouts, which are essential in this task.
- The task involves creating internet content that aligns with the brand's visual format, which may require specialized design knowledge and expertise beyond what an LLM can provide.

Based on these considerations, the task of collaborating with design staff to create multimedia websites or internet content that conforms to brand and company visual format is best classified as E0 - No exposure to LLM.
