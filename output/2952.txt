1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of conducting market research and analyzing industry trends as a Funeral Home Manager, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The LLM can assist in tasks that involve writing, summarizing, providing feedback, answering questions, and maintaining records of written data. In this case, the task involves researching and analyzing industry trends, which can be done through reading and summarizing reports, analyzing data, and potentially providing insights based on the information gathered. The LLM can help with summarizing industry reports, analyzing data trends, and even generating insights based on the information provided. However, the task may also require accessing up-to-date industry information, which the LLM alone may not be able to provide without recent data inputs.

Considering the complexity of the task and the need for up-to-date industry trends, the LLM alone may not reduce the time it takes to complete the task by at least half. However, it is easy to imagine additional software that could be developed on top of the LLM to enhance its capabilities for market research and trend analysis. This software could potentially retrieve up-to-date industry information from the internet, analyze complex datasets, and provide recommendations based on the analyzed data. Therefore, the task falls under label E2 - Exposure by LLM-powered applications.
