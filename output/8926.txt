1: In this task, a Bill and Account Collector is responsible for locating and notifying customers with delinquent accounts to solicit payment. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves communication with customers through mail, telephone, or personal visits to collect payments. While the task involves written and verbal communication, it also requires a level of interpersonal skills and judgment in dealing with customers who may be facing financial difficulties. The task does not involve complex data analysis, specialized domain knowledge, or image processing. Therefore, the task does not significantly benefit from the capabilities of an LLM or additional software beyond basic communication tools.
