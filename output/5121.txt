1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of developing plans to safeguard computer files as an Information Security Analyst, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be aided by the use of a large language model (LLM).

- Writing and transforming text: The task involves developing plans, which requires writing and transforming text to outline security measures.
- Providing edits to existing text: The LLM can assist in providing edits to existing security plans to enhance their effectiveness.
- Writing code to help perform a task: While the task does not explicitly involve writing code, the LLM could potentially assist in generating scripts or code snippets for security measures.
- Summarizing documents: The LLM can summarize relevant security documentation to aid in the development of safeguarding plans.
- Providing feedback on documents: The LLM can provide feedback on security plans to ensure they meet industry standards.
- Informing anyone of any information: The LLM can assist in informing stakeholders about security measures and emergency data processing needs.

Considering these points, the task of developing plans to safeguard computer files aligns closely with the capabilities of an LLM in terms of text generation, summarization, and providing feedback on documents. Therefore, this task falls under label E1 - Direct exposure.
