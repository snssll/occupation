1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of conducting internet-based and library research as a Social Science Research Assistant, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves searching for information online and in libraries, which can be time-consuming and require sifting through large amounts of data. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM can assist in conducting internet-based research by summarizing information, generating questions, or providing feedback on documents. It can also help in organizing and synthesizing data obtained from various sources. However, the LLM may not significantly reduce the time it takes to conduct research compared to a human researcher, as it may not have the ability to retrieve specific up-to-date facts from the internet without them being provided in the input.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not reduce the time significantly for conducting research, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to enhance the research process. For example, a tool that retrieves up-to-date facts from the internet and combines them with the LLM's capabilities could streamline the research process.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not relevant for the task of conducting internet-based and library research, as it primarily involves text-based information retrieval.

Based on the above analysis, the task of conducting internet-based and library research as a Social Science Research Assistant is best classified as E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications.
