1: In this task, a Camera Operator for Television, Video, and Film is required to set up and operate ENG microwave vehicles to gather and edit raw footage on location. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves technical skills related to operating equipment and editing footage, which may not directly benefit from the capabilities of an LLM. The task also requires physical presence and hands-on operation of equipment, which cannot be replaced by text-based AI models. As such, the task does not align with the capabilities of an LLM or LLM-powered tools, and therefore falls under E0.

2: E0

3: High
