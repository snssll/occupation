1: In this task of checking temperatures and humidities of shipping and storage areas, an LLM could potentially assist by providing guidelines on appropriate levels for different types of cargo, explaining the impact of incorrect temperature and humidity levels on cargo, and suggesting corrective actions if levels are not within the acceptable range. The LLM could also help in generating reports based on the data collected during inspections. However, since this task involves physical measurements and on-site inspections, the LLM alone would not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with high quality. While the LLM could provide some information and guidance, the core of the task still relies heavily on physical measurements and observations.
