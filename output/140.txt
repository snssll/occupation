1: In this task, a Cutter and Trimmer, Hand is responsible for adjusting guides and stops to control the depths and widths of cuts. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone or with additional software could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality.

- E0: This task involves physical adjustments and precise measurements, which cannot be effectively performed by the LLM or any software built on top of it. The task also does not involve written or spoken communication that the LLM could assist with.

- E1: The LLM could potentially assist in providing written instructions or documentation on how to adjust guides and stops for specific cuts. It could also help in summarizing relevant information or providing feedback on the process. However, the direct impact on reducing the time to complete the physical adjustments is limited.

- E2: While the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time for this task, it is conceivable that additional software could be developed to provide visual guides or simulations for adjusting guides and stops. This software could potentially enhance the efficiency of the process by offering real-time feedback or suggestions based on the input provided.

- E3: The task does not involve image processing or detailed visual instructions that would require image capabilities in addition to the LLM. Therefore, this task is not suitable for an E3 label.

2: E2

3: Moderate
