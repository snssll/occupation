1: In this task, the Dining Room and Cafeteria Attendants and Bartender Helpers are responsible for garnishing foods and positioning them on tables to make them visible and accessible. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if the task can be significantly expedited or improved by using the LLM. 

- The task of garnishing foods and positioning them on tables is a physical, hands-on task that involves manual dexterity and spatial awareness. It does not involve complex decision-making, analysis, or information retrieval that would benefit from the capabilities of the LLM.
- The task does not involve writing, summarizing documents, providing feedback, or any other text-based activities that the LLM excels at.
- While the LLM could potentially provide information on garnishing techniques or table setup ideas, the task itself is more practical and physical in nature, which the LLM cannot directly assist with.

Based on these considerations, the task of garnishing foods and positioning them on tables is best classified as E0 - No exposure to the LLM.
