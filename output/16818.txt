1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of teaching patients to use home health care equipment as a Patient Representative, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. In this task, the Patient Representative would need to provide detailed instructions, explanations, and potentially troubleshoot any issues that patients may encounter while using the equipment. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM could assist in generating detailed instructions, explanations, and troubleshooting steps for various home health care equipment. It can help in creating clear and concise guides tailored to different types of equipment and patient needs. The LLM can also provide responses to common questions or issues that patients may face while using the equipment.
- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to create interactive guides, simulations, or virtual training sessions for patients to learn how to use home health care equipment more effectively. This software could enhance the training experience and provide more personalized assistance.
- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities would not significantly impact the task of teaching patients to use home health care equipment, as the focus is on verbal and written instructions rather than visual aids.
