1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of recruiting and maintaining client bases as a Personal Financial Advisor, we need to consider how the task can be completed with the help of an LLM.

- E1: Direct exposure - The task involves communicating with potential and existing clients, which can benefit from the LLM's ability to generate written content, such as emails, client proposals, and reports. The LLM can assist in crafting persuasive messages and responses to client inquiries, ultimately saving time and improving the quality of communication.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time it takes to recruit and maintain client bases, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to streamline client relationship management. This software could analyze client data, provide personalized recommendations, and automate certain aspects of client communication, enhancing the efficiency of client base maintenance.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not directly relevant to the task of recruiting and maintaining client bases for Personal Financial Advisors. This task primarily involves written communication and relationship management, which can be effectively supported by the LLM's text generation capabilities.

Based on the above analysis, the task of recruiting and maintaining client bases as a Personal Financial Advisor is best classified as E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications.
