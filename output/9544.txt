1: In this task, the Cutting, Punching, and Press Machine Setters, Operators, and Tenders, Metal and Plastic need to mark identifying data on workpieces. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we can break down the task:
- The task involves marking identifying data on workpieces, which is a manual and physical task.
- This task does not involve text input or output that can be easily processed by an LLM.
- The task does not require complex decision-making, analysis of large amounts of data, or specialized knowledge that an LLM could assist with.
- There is no need for language translation, summarization, or generation of text.

Based on these considerations, the task does not align with any of the exposure levels in the rubric. It does not involve text-based work that an LLM could significantly assist with, nor does it require specialized knowledge or decision-making that could benefit from LLM capabilities.
