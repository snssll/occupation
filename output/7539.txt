1: In this task, the Low Vision Therapists, Orientation and Mobility Specialists, and Vision Rehabilitation Therapists are required to identify visual impairments related to basic life skills in various areas. To complete this task, the therapists need to assess the individual's abilities and challenges in performing tasks related to self-care, literacy, communication, health management, home management, and meal preparation. This task involves a combination of observation, assessment, and interaction with the individual to understand their specific needs and challenges.

Considering the nature of the task, it involves a high degree of human interaction, observation, and assessment that cannot be effectively replaced by an LLM. The task requires personalized evaluation and understanding of the individual's unique circumstances, which goes beyond the capabilities of text-based AI models. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not significantly benefit from LLM capabilities.
