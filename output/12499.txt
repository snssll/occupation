1: For the task of preparing dough following a recipe as a Fast Food Cook, the exposure to LLM can be evaluated as follows:

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM can assist in providing detailed instructions on how to prepare dough, including specific measurements and steps. It can also help troubleshoot any issues that may arise during the preparation process. This direct access to guidance and support can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While there may be potential for software applications to be developed on top of the LLM that could further streamline the dough preparation process, such as providing real-time adjustments based on environmental factors or ingredient availability, the immediate impact on reducing time by half may not be as clear as with direct access to the LLM.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities would not significantly impact the task of preparing dough following a recipe, as it is primarily text-based and does not involve detailed visual instructions or image processing.

Based on the above analysis, the task of preparing dough following a recipe as a Fast Food Cook is best classified as E1: Direct exposure.
