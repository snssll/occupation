1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of summarizing budgets and submitting recommendations as a Budget Analyst, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be aided by the use of a large language model (LLM) like OpenAI's model.

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** The task involves summarizing budgets and making recommendations based on the information provided. An LLM can assist in summarizing complex budget documents, analyzing financial data, and generating recommendations based on the input data. The model can help in transforming and organizing the information in a coherent and concise manner, which aligns with the capabilities of an LLM. Therefore, this task could benefit significantly from direct access to the LLM, reducing the time needed to complete it with equivalent quality.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the task could potentially be aided by additional software developed on top of the LLM, such as tools for analyzing financial data, providing insights, or generating detailed reports, the core task of summarizing budgets and submitting recommendations may not require highly specialized domain knowledge or complex databases beyond what the LLM can offer. Therefore, the task may not benefit as much from additional software beyond the LLM itself.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Image capabilities are not relevant for the task of summarizing budgets and submitting recommendations as it primarily involves working with text-based financial data and documents. The task does not require image processing or editing capabilities.
