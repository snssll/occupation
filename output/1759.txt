1: In this task of cataloguing and sorting books and materials in a library, the main activities involve organizing items according to specific procedures and returning them to their designated storage areas. This task primarily involves manual labor and does not require complex decision-making or specialized knowledge beyond basic library procedures. While an LLM could potentially assist in generating documentation or instructions for cataloguing processes, the core task of physically handling and sorting materials cannot be significantly expedited by the LLM. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not benefit from direct exposure to the LLM.
