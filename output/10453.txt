1: In this task, a Parking Enforcement Worker is required to observe and report hazardous conditions related to traffic signals, signs, and street markings. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes for an average worker to complete this task with equivalent quality. 

Given the nature of the task, which involves physical observation and reporting of real-world conditions, it is unlikely that the LLM can directly assist in completing the task. The task requires on-the-ground assessment and reporting of specific physical conditions that cannot be captured through text input alone. While the LLM could potentially provide information on regulations or guidelines related to traffic signals and signs, it cannot physically observe or report hazardous conditions in real-time.
