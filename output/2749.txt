1: In this task, a Counter and Rental Clerk is responsible for computing charges for merchandise or services and receiving payments. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality.

- The task involves basic calculations and transactions, which can be easily handled by the LLM through text input and output.
- The LLM can generate text-based calculations and provide responses for receiving payments.
- The context for this task is well-defined within the task description itself, and no up-to-date facts are required.
- The LLM can assist in generating text for receipts or payment confirmations.

Based on these considerations, the task can be significantly expedited with the use of the LLM, making it suitable for an E1 label.
