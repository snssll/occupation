1: In this task, a dishwasher is responsible for transferring supplies or equipment between storage and work areas, either by hand or using hand trucks. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be automated or significantly assisted by the language model. Since this task involves physical movement and manual labor, it does not directly involve text-based instructions, complex data analysis, or decision-making that can be easily handled by an LLM. The task does not involve writing, summarizing, analyzing text, or any other activity that would benefit from the language model's capabilities. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM.

2: E0

3: High
