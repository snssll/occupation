1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of recommending improvements in security systems or procedures as a Security Management Specialist, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be aided by the use of the LLM.

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** The task involves analyzing existing security systems or procedures and providing recommendations for improvements. The LLM can assist in generating potential ideas for enhancing security measures based on the input provided about the current systems. The model can offer insights, suggestions, and even draft reports on security enhancements, which can significantly reduce the time it takes to come up with comprehensive recommendations.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the LLM can provide valuable input and suggestions for security improvements, developing specialized software on top of the LLM could further enhance its capabilities. This software could potentially analyze large volumes of security data, identify trends, and recommend specific actions based on real-time security threats or industry best practices. Such software could streamline the process of recommending security system improvements even further.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Image capabilities are not directly relevant to the task of recommending improvements in security systems or procedures. This task primarily involves analyzing and enhancing security protocols, which can be effectively addressed through text-based interactions with the LLM.

Based on the above analysis, the most fitting label for this task is **E1 (Direct exposure)**.
