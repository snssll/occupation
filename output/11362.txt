1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of performing annual gynecologic exams as a midwife, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. In this task, the midwife needs to physically examine patients, which cannot be done using text-based tools like the LLM. The task involves hands-on skills and interactions with patients that cannot be replicated by the LLM or any software tool. Therefore, this task falls under the E0 category as it requires a high degree of human interaction and physical examination.
