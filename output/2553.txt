1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of comparing a property with similar properties to determine its competitive market price, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves analyzing real estate data, understanding market trends, and making pricing decisions based on this information. The LLM can assist in providing general information about real estate markets, trends, and pricing strategies. It can also help in comparing different properties based on certain criteria. However, the task also requires access to up-to-date information on recently sold properties, which the LLM may not be able to provide without the information being explicitly stated in the input. Since the task involves real-time data analysis and decision-making, the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task.
