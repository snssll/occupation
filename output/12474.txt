1: In this task, an Environmental Compliance Inspector is required to prepare data to calculate sewer service charges and capacity fees. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could assist in completing it. 

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** If the task involves a significant amount of data preparation that can be automated or streamlined by using the LLM to gather, organize, and analyze relevant information, then it could fall under E1. The LLM could assist in extracting data from documents, summarizing information, and even performing calculations based on the provided data.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** If the task requires accessing specialized domain knowledge related to sewer service charges and capacity fees, the LLM alone may not be sufficient to reduce the time significantly. However, with the development of additional software that can retrieve specific data related to these charges and fees, the overall time taken to complete the task could be reduced by half.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Since the task involves preparing data for calculations, which is primarily text-based, and does not require detailed image analysis, the image capabilities of the LLM would not significantly impact the completion time of the task.

Considering the nature of the task and the potential for the LLM to assist in data preparation and analysis, I would lean towards labeling this task as **E1 (Direct exposure)**.
