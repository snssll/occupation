1: In this task, the main responsibility is to greet customers and make them feel welcome. This task involves interpersonal skills and customer service, which are not directly related to the capabilities of the LLM. The LLM cannot physically greet customers or interact with them in person, as it is a text-based model. While the LLM could potentially generate text for training materials on customer service or provide written responses for customer interactions, the task of physically greeting customers and making them feel welcome is not something the LLM can directly assist with. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not involve text-based interactions that the LLM can significantly impact.

2: E0

3: High
