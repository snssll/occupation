1: In this task, a neurologist is required to perform or interpret the outcomes of various procedures and diagnostic tests related to neurological conditions. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task and how an LLM could potentially assist in completing it. 

- **E0**: This task involves hands-on medical procedures and tests that require specialized medical knowledge, skills, and physical presence. An LLM cannot physically perform procedures like lumbar punctures or conduct tests like electroencephalography. Additionally, the interpretation of test results requires in-depth medical expertise and clinical judgment, which an LLM may not possess.

- **E1**: While an LLM can provide general information about these procedures and tests, it cannot physically perform them or interpret the results accurately without the necessary medical training and expertise. The task involves practical skills and specialized medical knowledge that go beyond the capabilities of an LLM.

- **E2**: It is conceivable that an application could be developed to assist neurologists by summarizing research articles, guidelines, or case studies related to these procedures and tests. Such an application could help neurologists stay updated on the latest advancements and best practices in the field, potentially saving time in researching and reviewing relevant literature.

- **E3**: Given the limitations of current technology, including the inability of an LLM to physically perform medical procedures or interpret test results, the task does not align with the capabilities of image-related tools.
