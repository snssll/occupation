1: Personal Care Aides perform housekeeping duties, such as cooking, cleaning, washing clothes or dishes, or running errands. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality. In this case, the task involves practical, hands-on activities that require physical presence and interaction with the environment. The LLM, even with its text-based capabilities, cannot directly perform these physical tasks. While it could potentially provide written instructions or guidance on housekeeping duties, the actual execution of these tasks would still require human intervention. Therefore, the task does not align with the capabilities of the LLM, and it falls under E0.

2: E0
