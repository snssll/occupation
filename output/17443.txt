1: In this task, the court reporter or simultaneous captioner is required to type court orders for judges. This task involves transcribing spoken words into written text accurately and efficiently. With the help of the powerful OpenAI large language model (LLM), the court reporter could potentially use the model to transcribe the spoken court orders into written text more quickly and accurately than doing it manually. The LLM can assist in transforming the spoken words into written text, which aligns with tasks such as writing and transforming text according to complex instructions. The LLM can also help in maintaining records of written data by providing a digital copy of the court orders. Therefore, this task could be classified as E1, as direct access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality.
