1: In this task, an Ophthalmic Medical Technician is required to adjust or make minor repairs to spectacles or eyeglasses. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. Adjusting or making minor repairs to spectacles involves physical manipulation of the glasses, which cannot be done by an LLM or any software tool. This task requires hands-on work, precision, and expertise in handling delicate optical equipment. Since the task involves physical actions and precise measurements, it falls under the category of tasks that cannot be completed by an LLM or LLM-powered tool. Therefore, the appropriate label for this task is E0.

2: E0

3: High
