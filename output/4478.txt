1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of designing surveys, opinion polls, or other data collection instruments as a Data Scientist, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves creating structured questions to gather specific information, which can be done through text input and output within the 2000-word context limit of the LLM. The LLM can assist in generating questions, providing feedback on the wording of questions, and even suggesting potential survey structures based on the input provided. This task falls under the category of "Writing questions for an interview or assessment" in the exposure rubric, which is directly supported by the LLM's text generation capabilities.
