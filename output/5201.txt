1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of developing systems for collecting, analyzing, and interpreting environmental and economic data as an Environmental Economist, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be impacted by the use of the LLM.

- Environmental Economists typically require expertise in both environmental science and economics to analyze complex data related to environmental issues and policies.
- The task involves developing systems, which may include designing data collection methods, analyzing large datasets, and interpreting the results to inform decision-making.
- While the LLM can assist in writing reports, summarizing data, or providing general information on environmental and economic topics, it may not significantly reduce the time required to develop complex data analysis systems.
- The task involves specialized domain knowledge in environmental economics, which may not be easily accessible or accurately retrievable by the LLM alone.
- The LLM may not have the capability to provide specific recommendations based on the analyzed data or to design complex data collection systems without significant human input.

Based on these considerations, the task of developing systems for collecting, analyzing, and interpreting environmental and economic data as an Environmental Economist is best classified as E2 - Exposure by LLM-powered applications.
