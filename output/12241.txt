1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of practicing performances as a musician or singer, we need to consider how the task can be completed with the help of an LLM.

- The task involves practicing performances individually or with other musicians to master music pieces. An LLM could potentially assist by providing feedback on musical techniques, suggesting practice strategies, or even generating new musical ideas.
- The LLM could also help in summarizing music theory concepts, providing historical context for pieces being practiced, or even generating new compositions for practice.
- While the LLM may not directly reduce the time it takes to practice a performance, it could enhance the quality of practice sessions by providing valuable insights and resources.
