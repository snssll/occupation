1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of training staff members as a Lodging Manager, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be facilitated by the use of the OpenAI large language model (LLM).

- E1: Direct exposure - If the task involves creating training materials, providing instructions, or documenting training procedures, the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete these tasks by generating written content, instructions, or guidelines. The LLM can assist in writing training manuals, developing training modules, or even drafting emails to communicate with staff members regarding training sessions.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not reduce the time it takes to train staff members, additional software built on top of the LLM could potentially streamline the training process. This software could include tools for creating interactive training modules, personalized training plans based on individual staff needs, or automated assessment tools to evaluate staff learning progress.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not directly relevant to the task of training staff members in this context, as the task primarily involves written communication and instruction rather than visual content.
