1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of evaluating information from documents as an Arbitrator, Mediator, or Conciliator, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it. 

- The task involves evaluating information from various documents, which requires reading and understanding the content provided.
- The LLM can assist in summarizing the documents, extracting key information, and potentially providing insights or recommendations based on the content.
- The LLM can also help in cross-referencing information from different documents to identify inconsistencies or patterns.
- While the LLM can aid in processing text-based information, it may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task by half, as human judgment and interpretation are crucial in this role.

Based on these considerations, the task falls under E2 - Exposure by LLM-powered applications. While the LLM can provide valuable support in processing and analyzing text-based information, additional software tailored to this specific task could further enhance efficiency.
