1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of scheduling and facilitating meetings related to information technology projects, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves organizing and coordinating meetings, which primarily requires written communication skills and organizational abilities. The LLM can assist in drafting meeting agendas, sending out meeting invites, and summarizing meeting outcomes. It can also help in generating email reminders, setting up calendar invites, and providing suggestions for effective meeting facilitation techniques. Overall, the LLM can significantly reduce the time spent on administrative tasks related to scheduling and facilitating meetings.

Considering the task falls under written communication and organizational skills, the LLM can streamline these processes and provide valuable support in managing meetings efficiently. Therefore, this task aligns with the E1 label as direct access to the LLM can reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality by at least half.
