1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of inventorying and ordering medical, lab, or office supplies or equipment as a Medical Assistant, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be impacted by the use of an LLM.

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** If the task involves writing and transforming text (such as creating supply orders), providing edits to existing text (like updating inventory lists), or generating questions related to inventory management, the LLM could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete these tasks with equivalent quality. The LLM can assist in drafting emails for ordering supplies, summarizing inventory reports, or even generating questions for inventory audits.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the LLM alone may not reduce the time it takes to complete the task by half, additional software built on top of the LLM could enhance the process. For instance, an application that can search and retrieve up-to-date information on medical supplies, compare prices, or suggest optimal ordering quantities based on historical data could streamline the inventory management process.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Image capabilities would not significantly impact the task of inventorying and ordering supplies or equipment as it primarily involves text-based activities rather than image processing.
