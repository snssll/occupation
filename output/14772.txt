1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of researching job and worker requirements, structural and functional relationships among jobs and occupations, and occupational trends as a Compensation, Benefits, and Job Analysis Specialist, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves gathering and analyzing information related to job roles, requirements, relationships, and trends in the job market.

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM can assist in researching and summarizing information related to job requirements, relationships, and trends. It can help in analyzing text data and providing insights based on the input provided. The LLM can generate reports, summaries, and recommendations based on the data given to it, which aligns with the task of a Compensation, Benefits, and Job Analysis Specialist.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM can provide valuable insights and summaries, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to enhance its capabilities further. For example, a specialized tool could be created to extract specific job-related data from various sources, analyze trends more comprehensively, or provide recommendations based on the analyzed information.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Since the task primarily involves text-based research and analysis of job-related information, image capabilities are not directly relevant to this task.

Based on the above analysis, the task of researching job and worker requirements, structural and functional relationships among jobs and occupations, and occupational trends as a Compensation, Benefits, and Job Analysis Specialist aligns best with **E1: Direct exposure** to the LLM.
