1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of conducting user research and analyzing user feedback as a Web and Digital Interface Designer, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it. 

- Conducting user research involves gathering data from users through surveys, interviews, and observations to understand their needs and preferences. The LLM could assist in generating survey questions, interview scripts, and data analysis templates based on best practices and common user research methodologies. This would save time compared to manually creating these materials.

- Analyzing user feedback involves synthesizing qualitative and quantitative data to identify patterns, trends, and insights that can inform design decisions. The LLM could help in summarizing large amounts of feedback, identifying key themes, and generating reports or presentations based on the analysis.

Considering these points, the task of conducting user research and analyzing user feedback could benefit significantly from the LLM's capabilities in generating research materials, analyzing data, and summarizing findings. This would fall under the category of E1 - Direct exposure, as the LLM can reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality by at least half.
