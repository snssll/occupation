1: In this task, a Clinical Research Coordinator is required to participate in the development of study protocols, including guidelines for administration or data collection procedures. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves writing and transforming text (developing study protocols and guidelines).
- The task requires understanding complex instructions and translating them into written guidelines.
- The task may involve summarizing information to create concise protocols.
- The task does not involve retrieving up-to-date facts from the internet or highly specialized domain knowledge.
- The task does not require image capabilities for completion.

Based on these considerations, the task falls under E1 as it involves writing and transforming text according to complex instructions, which can be efficiently completed with the help of an LLM.
