1: To evaluate current or emerging technologies as a Computer Systems Engineer/Architect, one would typically need to research and analyze various technologies, considering factors like cost, portability, compatibility, and usability. With access to the powerful OpenAI large language model (LLM), one could efficiently gather information on different technologies, compare their features, and assess their suitability based on the specified factors. The LLM could assist in summarizing information from a wide range of sources, providing insights into the latest trends and advancements in technology. Additionally, the model could help in generating reports or recommendations based on the analysis conducted. Overall, the LLM could significantly streamline the research and decision-making process involved in evaluating technologies for Computer Systems Engineers/Architects.
