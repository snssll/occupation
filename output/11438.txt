1: In this task, a Light Truck Driver is required to perform emergency repairs such as changing tires, installing light bulbs, fuses, tire chains, or spark plugs. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone or with additional software could significantly reduce the time it takes for a worker to complete this task with high quality.

- E0: This task involves physical actions like changing tires or installing parts, which cannot be directly assisted by the LLM or any software tool. The task also requires hands-on skills and immediate physical presence, making it unsuitable for automation through text-based tools alone.

- E1: While the LLM could potentially provide guidance on how to perform these repairs or offer troubleshooting tips, the actual execution of tasks like changing tires or installing parts requires physical interaction and cannot be fully automated through text-based instructions. Therefore, the LLM alone would not reduce the time significantly for a worker to complete this task.

- E2: It is conceivable that specialized software could be developed to assist Light Truck Drivers by providing real-time visual guides or step-by-step instructions for emergency repairs. This software could potentially integrate with the LLM to offer tailored solutions based on the specific repair needed. However, as of now, such software does not exist, and the task still heavily relies on physical actions.

- E3: The task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images, so the image capabilities of the LLM are not directly applicable here.
