1: In this task, a Non-Destructive Testing Specialist is required to conduct liquid penetrant tests to locate surface cracks on objects. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves physical actions such as coating objects with fluorescent dyes, cleaning excess penetrant, and applying developer. These actions cannot be directly performed by an LLM or any software tool. The task also requires specialized knowledge and skills related to non-destructive testing techniques, which are not typically within the capabilities of an LLM. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not involve text-based activities that can be significantly expedited or enhanced by an LLM.
