1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of negotiating collective bargaining agreements as a Labor Relations Specialist in relation to exposure to LLM, we can break down the task as follows:

- Negotiating collective bargaining agreements involves complex interactions, understanding of labor laws, company policies, and employee needs.
- The task requires a deep understanding of the specific context, historical agreements, and current labor market conditions.
- LLM can assist in providing general information on labor laws, sample agreements, and potential negotiation strategies.
- LLM can help generate responses to hypothetical scenarios or provide suggestions based on common negotiation tactics.
- However, negotiating collective bargaining agreements is highly nuanced, involves real-time interactions, and requires the ability to read non-verbal cues and adapt strategies on the spot.

Based on these considerations, the task of negotiating collective bargaining agreements as a Labor Relations Specialist would fall under E0 as it involves real-time human interactions, nuanced understanding of specific contexts, and the need for adaptability beyond what an LLM can provide.
