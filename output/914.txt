1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of approving or denying the issuance of certificates of airworthiness for Aviation Inspectors, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be supported by the capabilities of the LLM.

- E0: This task involves making critical decisions based on regulations, safety standards, and technical knowledge related to aircraft airworthiness. It requires expertise, experience, and legal authority, which cannot be replaced by the LLM.

- E1: While the LLM can provide information on regulations and standards related to airworthiness, ultimately, the decision to approve or deny certificates requires specialized knowledge, experience, and legal understanding that the LLM cannot provide. The final decision-making process involves a high level of expertise and judgment that goes beyond what the LLM can offer.

- E2: It is conceivable that software could be developed to assist Aviation Inspectors by providing quick access to relevant regulations, standards, and historical data related to airworthiness assessments. This software could potentially streamline the information retrieval process, but the final decision-making would still rely heavily on the expertise and judgment of the inspectors.

- E3: The task of approving or denying certificates of airworthiness does not involve image processing capabilities, so exposure to LLM and image capabilities would not significantly impact the completion of this task.
