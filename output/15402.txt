1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of securing commitments of participation or donation from individuals or corporate donors as a fundraiser, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it more efficiently.

- E1: Direct exposure - The task involves communication and persuasion, which are skills that can be enhanced through the use of language models like the LLM. The LLM can help fundraisers craft compelling messages, responses to objections, and personalized outreach to potential donors. It can also assist in drafting effective email campaigns, donation requests, and follow-up communications. Overall, the LLM can significantly reduce the time needed to create persuasive content tailored to different donors.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM can assist in generating text for fundraising purposes, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to automate certain aspects of donor outreach. For example, a specialized fundraising tool could integrate with the LLM to analyze donor data, suggest personalized messaging strategies, track donor interactions, and provide real-time insights to optimize fundraising efforts. Such a tool could further streamline the fundraising process and enhance donor engagement.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not directly relevant to the task of securing commitments from donors through communication and persuasion. Therefore, this task does not fall under E3.

Based on the above analysis, the task of securing commitments of participation or donation from individuals or corporate donors as a fundraiser aligns best with **E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications**.
