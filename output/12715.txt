1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of preparing reports of selection, survey, or other statistics and recommendations for corrective action as an Equal Opportunity Representative or Officer, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be facilitated by the use of a large language model (LLM).

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** If the task involves writing and transforming text based on complex instructions, providing edits to existing text following specifications, generating recommendations based on data analysis, or preparing reports based on general knowledge, then direct access to the LLM could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality. In this case, the LLM could assist in drafting reports, analyzing survey data, and generating recommendations.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the task may not be directly reducible to text-based interactions with the LLM, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to summarize complex statistical data, provide recommendations based on specialized knowledge, or analyze survey results to inform corrective actions. Such software could enhance the capabilities of the LLM in handling the specific requirements of this task.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Since the task primarily involves preparing reports and recommendations based on statistical data and surveys, image capabilities may not be directly relevant in this context. Therefore, the use of image capabilities provided by the LLM would not significantly impact the completion of this task.
