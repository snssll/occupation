1: In this task, a construction laborer is required to position or dismantle forms for pouring concrete using tools like saws, hammers, nails, or bolts. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves physical labor and hands-on work that cannot be directly replaced by an LLM. While the LLM could potentially provide information on best practices for form positioning or dismantling, it cannot physically perform the task itself. Therefore, the task falls under E0 as it does not involve text-based work that can be significantly expedited or enhanced by the LLM.

2: E0

3: High
