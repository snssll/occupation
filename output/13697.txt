1: In this task, the Radio Frequency Identification Device (RFID) Specialist is required to stay updated on industry research about new technologies. To complete this task, the specialist would need to read current literature, attend meetings or conferences, and talk with colleagues. 

Considering the task involves staying abreast of industry research, an LLM could assist by summarizing relevant articles, providing insights from past conferences, or generating questions for further exploration based on the information gathered. The LLM could also help in drafting emails to colleagues for discussions or compiling notes from meetings. However, the task does not involve complex data analysis, specialized domain knowledge retrieval, or detailed image processing, which would require additional capabilities beyond text generation.

Given that the task primarily involves text-based activities such as reading, attending meetings, and discussions, the direct exposure to the LLM (E1) seems most appropriate. The LLM can significantly reduce the time needed to gather, summarize, and communicate information related to industry research, thereby enhancing the efficiency of staying updated on new technologies.
