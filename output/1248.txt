1: In this task, a Social and Human Service Assistant is required to assist clients with the preparation of forms, such as tax or rent forms. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves providing assistance to clients with filling out specific forms, which requires understanding the context of the forms and potentially providing guidance on how to complete them accurately.
- The task does not involve complex decision-making or specialized domain knowledge beyond understanding the forms and assisting clients with them.
- The task primarily involves written communication and providing instructions or guidance to clients.

Based on these considerations, the task of assisting clients with the preparation of forms falls under the category of tasks that can be significantly aided by the use of an LLM. The LLM can help in providing guidance on filling out forms, explaining complex instructions, and generating responses to common questions related to form completion. Therefore, this task can be classified as E1 - Direct exposure.
