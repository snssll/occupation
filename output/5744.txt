1: In this task, a Real Estate Sales Agent is required to display various types of properties to clients and explain their features. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM could potentially assist in generating scripts or descriptions for the properties being displayed, helping the agent explain features more effectively. It could also aid in preparing detailed information about each property to present to clients.
- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time it takes to physically display properties, additional software could be developed to provide virtual property tours or interactive property showcases, enhancing the agent's ability to present properties to clients remotely.
- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - If the LLM had image capabilities, it could potentially assist in creating visual presentations or digital images of properties to show clients, enhancing the overall presentation.

Considering the task involves physically displaying properties to clients, the most suitable exposure label would be E0 as the task requires direct human interaction and cannot be significantly expedited by the LLM alone.
