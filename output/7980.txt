1: In this task, a Host or Hostess in a restaurant, lounge, or coffee shop is responsible for inspecting restrooms for cleanliness and ensuring the availability of supplies. They also need to clean the restrooms when necessary. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we can break down the task:
- Writing and transforming text: The task involves some written communication, such as noting down the cleanliness status of the restrooms.
- Providing edits to existing text: The host or hostess may need to update a checklist or report on restroom conditions.
- Providing feedback on documents: They may need to provide feedback on the cleanliness status of the restrooms.
- Informing anyone of any information via any written or spoken medium: The host or hostess may need to communicate with the cleaning staff or management about restroom conditions.

Given that the task involves primarily written communication and reporting, the LLM could assist in generating checklists, reports, or communication messages related to restroom cleanliness and supplies.
