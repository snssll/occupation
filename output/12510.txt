1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of preparing environmental impact statements, reports, or presentations for regulatory or other agencies as a Nuclear Engineer, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it. 

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** The task involves writing detailed reports and presentations that require technical knowledge and expertise in the field of nuclear engineering. The LLM could assist in generating text, providing information on environmental impacts related to nuclear engineering, and helping with the structure and wording of the reports. The LLM could significantly reduce the time it takes to draft these documents by providing relevant information and suggestions for content.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the LLM alone could help with generating text and providing some information, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to streamline the process further. This software could potentially summarize complex technical data, retrieve up-to-date environmental impact information, and assist in organizing the content of the reports more efficiently.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Image capabilities would not significantly impact the task of preparing environmental impact statements, reports, or presentations for regulatory agencies as it primarily involves text-based content related to environmental impacts and regulatory compliance.

Considering the above points, the task of preparing environmental impact statements, reports, or presentations for regulatory or other agencies as a Nuclear Engineer would likely fall under **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications)**.
