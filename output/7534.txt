1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of "Identify training and development needs" for Industrial-Organizational Psychologists in terms of exposure to LLM, we can break down the task as follows:

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** If the task involves analyzing existing data, reports, and employee feedback to identify training and development needs, the LLM could assist in processing and summarizing this information. The LLM could help in generating insights based on the provided data and potentially offer suggestions for training programs based on trends identified in the data.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** If the task requires accessing specialized domain knowledge or industry-specific trends to identify training and development needs, the LLM alone may not be sufficient. However, with additional software developed on top of the LLM that can retrieve and analyze industry-specific data, the time taken to complete the task could be significantly reduced.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** This task does not involve image processing or analysis, so image capabilities would not significantly impact the time it takes to complete the task.
