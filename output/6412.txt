1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of evaluating findings and developing strategies and arguments in preparation for the presentation of cases for Lawyers, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The LLM can assist in writing and transforming text, providing edits to existing text, summarizing documents, answering questions about documents, and generating questions a user might want to ask about a document. In this case, the task involves analyzing information, formulating strategies, and preparing arguments based on legal findings, which requires a deep understanding of legal concepts, case law, and regulations. While the LLM can provide some assistance in summarizing legal documents and potentially generating questions, it lacks the specialized domain knowledge and expertise required for legal analysis and strategy development. Therefore, the task is not easily reducible to writing and transforming text or providing edits, making it unsuitable for direct exposure (E1). Additionally, developing software on top of the LLM to handle legal analysis and strategy development would be highly complex and may not significantly reduce the time needed to complete the task, placing it outside the scope of exposure by LLM-powered applications (E2). The task does not involve image capabilities, so it does not fall under E3 either.
