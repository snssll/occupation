1: In this task, an Amusement and Recreation Attendant is responsible for tending amusement booths in various entertainment venues. The attendant performs duties such as conducting games, photographing patrons, and awarding prizes. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be significantly aided by the use of the language model. 

- The task involves interacting with patrons, conducting games, and awarding prizes, which are hands-on activities that require physical presence and human interaction. These aspects cannot be directly replaced by the LLM.
- While the LLM could potentially assist in generating written materials like game instructions or prize information, the core tasks of conducting games and interacting with patrons are not text-based and require physical presence.
- The LLM may not have the capability to assist in tasks that involve real-time interactions, physical movements, or decision-making based on immediate observations.

Based on these considerations, the task of tending amusement booths as described would likely fall under E0 as it involves physical presence, human interaction, and real-time decision-making that cannot be effectively replaced by the LLM.
