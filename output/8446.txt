1: In this task, a Clinical Neuropsychologist is required to interview patients to obtain comprehensive medical histories. With access to the most powerful OpenAI large language model (LLM), the model can assist in generating a list of relevant questions to ask during the patient interview based on general knowledge of medical history-taking practices. The LLM can also help in structuring the information obtained during the interview in a coherent and organized manner. Additionally, the model can provide suggestions on probing further into specific areas based on the patient's responses. However, the task of interviewing patients itself involves human interaction, active listening, empathy, and the ability to establish rapport, which are skills that cannot be fully replaced by the LLM. While the LLM can aid in preparing for the interview and structuring the information obtained, the core aspect of patient interaction remains a human-centric skill.
