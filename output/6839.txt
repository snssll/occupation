1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of explaining the use of library facilities, resources, equipment, and services, as well as providing information about library policies, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves providing detailed information about library-related topics, which falls within the realm of general knowledge and does not require specialized domain knowledge. The LLM can generate text based on the input provided and can summarize information effectively. In this case, the LLM can assist in crafting explanations and providing information about library policies accurately. Since the task does not involve complex databases, highly specialized domain knowledge, or the need for up-to-date facts from the internet, the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality.
