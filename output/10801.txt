1: In this task, the construction laborer is required to operate jackhammers or drills to break up concrete or pavement. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM could significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality by at least half.

- E0: This task involves physical labor and precise operation of machinery, which cannot be directly assisted by the LLM. The LLM does not have the capability to physically operate equipment or perform tasks that require physical presence.
- E1: The LLM could potentially provide information on best practices for operating jackhammers or drills, safety guidelines, or troubleshooting tips. It could also assist in writing reports or documentation related to the task. However, the direct operation of the machinery cannot be performed by the LLM.
- E2: While the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time it takes to operate jackhammers or drills, additional software could potentially be developed to provide virtual training simulations, safety guidelines, or troubleshooting assistance based on the LLM's capabilities. This software could enhance the efficiency of training and preparation for the task.
- E3: The task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images, so the image capabilities of the LLM are not directly relevant to this task.

2: E0

3: High
