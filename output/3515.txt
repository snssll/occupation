1: In this task, a Naturopathic Physician consults with other health professionals to ensure optimal patient care, referring patients to traditional healthcare professionals when needed. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves communication and collaboration with other professionals, which may require writing and responding to emails, providing feedback on patient care plans, and potentially summarizing patient cases for referrals.
- The task may involve generating questions for consultations with other health professionals or responding to inquiries from them.
- While the task involves interacting with other professionals, it does not require specialized domain knowledge beyond healthcare and patient care.
- The task does not involve creating or editing digital images, reading text from PDFs, or any other image-related capabilities.

Based on these considerations, the task falls under E1 as it involves written communication, collaboration, and potentially generating questions or responding to inquiries, all of which can be efficiently handled by the LLM.
