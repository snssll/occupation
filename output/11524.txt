1: In this task, a Radio, Cellular, and Tower Equipment Installer and Repairer is required to perform maintenance or repair work on existing tower equipment using hand or power tools. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider whether access to the LLM alone or with additional software could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality.

- E0: This task involves physical work that requires the use of hand or power tools. The task cannot be completed solely through text-based instructions or information provided by the LLM. Therefore, this task does not fit the criteria for exposure to LLM capabilities.

2: E0

3: High
