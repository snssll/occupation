1: In this task, a Lighting Technician is required to test lighting equipment to ensure it functions correctly and produces the desired lighting effects. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. Testing lighting equipment involves practical, hands-on work that requires physical interaction with the equipment. This task does not involve writing, summarizing text, analyzing documents, or any other activity that can be directly facilitated by an LLM. The task also does not involve accessing specialized domain knowledge or complex databases that could be enhanced by LLM capabilities. Since the task is primarily hands-on and does not align with the capabilities of an LLM, it falls under the category of no exposure (E0).

2: E0
