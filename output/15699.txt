1: In this task, the motorboat operator is required to service motors by changing oil and lubricating parts. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality by at least half.

- The task of servicing motors by changing oil and lubricating parts is a hands-on, physical task that requires manual dexterity and knowledge of mechanical systems.
- While the LLM can provide information on how to perform these tasks theoretically, it cannot physically perform the tasks itself.
- The LLM cannot provide real-time feedback on the condition of the motor or the effectiveness of the servicing.
- The task does not involve complex decision-making that the LLM could assist with significantly.

Based on these considerations, it is unlikely that access to the LLM alone would reduce the time it takes to complete this task by at least half. Therefore, this task falls under label E0.

2: E0

3: High
