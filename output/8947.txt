1: In this task, the Dining Room and Cafeteria Attendants and Bartender Helpers are required to locate items requested by customers. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could assist in completing it. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM could potentially assist in providing guidance on how to efficiently locate items or suggest strategies for organizing items to make them easier to find. It could also help in generating responses to common customer requests or inquiries related to item locations.
  
- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task, additional software could be developed to create a database of item locations, customer preferences, and common requests. This software could then provide real-time suggestions to the attendants based on customer input.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities would not significantly impact the task of locating items requested by customers, as it primarily involves text-based interactions and physical movement within the dining room or cafeteria.

Based on the above analysis, the task of locating items requested by customers would likely fall under E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications.
