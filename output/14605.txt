1: In this task, a Furniture Finisher is required to replace or refurbish upholstery using various tools and materials. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be significantly aided by the use of the language model. 

- The task involves practical skills such as using tacks, adhesives, and solvents, which cannot be directly assisted by an LLM.
- While the LLM could potentially provide information on techniques, materials, or troubleshooting tips related to upholstery refurbishment, the task primarily involves hands-on work that cannot be directly substituted by text-based assistance.
- The task does not involve complex decision-making, data analysis, or specialized knowledge retrieval that would greatly benefit from LLM capabilities.

Based on these considerations, the task does not align with any of the exposure levels provided, as the nature of the work is hands-on and practical, requiring physical skills and tools that are beyond the capabilities of an LLM.
