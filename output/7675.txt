1: In this task, a Transportation Security Screener needs to inform passengers of the procedure for mailing prohibited items to themselves or confiscating these items. This task involves providing clear and accurate information to passengers regarding security protocols. With the help of the LLM, the screener could potentially draft standardized responses or scripts to use when communicating with passengers. The LLM could assist in generating informative and polite messages that explain the options available to passengers. Additionally, the LLM could help in crafting detailed instructions on how to properly package and mail prohibited items. Overall, the LLM could significantly reduce the time it takes to prepare these communication materials and ensure consistency in the information provided to passengers.
