1: In this task, an Appraiser and Assessor of Real Estate needs to examine the type and location of nearby services to evaluate their impact on property values. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we can break down the task:
- Research nearby services: The LLM can assist in providing information about various nearby services such as shopping centers, schools, parks, etc., based on existing data and knowledge.
- Evaluate impact on property values: The LLM can help in analyzing how the presence or absence of certain services might affect property values based on general knowledge and trends.

Considering the task involves analyzing existing data and making evaluations based on that data, the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to gather relevant information and provide insights into the impact of nearby services on property values. Therefore, this task falls under E1 as the LLM can assist in writing and transforming text according to complex instructions and providing feedback on documents related to property evaluations.
