1: In this task, an Elevator and Escalator Installer and Repairer is responsible for ensuring that safety regulations and building codes are adhered to while completing service reports to confirm compliance with standards. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we can break down the task:
- Checking safety regulations and building codes involves understanding and interpreting complex legal and technical language, which the LLM can assist with by providing relevant information and explanations.
- Completing service reports requires organizing and summarizing information, which the LLM can help with by generating structured reports based on input data.
- Verifying conformance to standards may involve comparing data against predefined criteria, a task that the LLM can automate by processing the information and providing insights.

Considering the task involves text-based activities that can benefit from the LLM's capabilities in information retrieval, summarization, and analysis, it aligns more with E1 exposure.
