1: In this task, the Stationary Engineers and Boiler Operators are required to ignite fuel in burners using torches or flames. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. Igniting fuel in burners using torches or flames is a hands-on task that involves physical interaction with equipment and potential safety hazards. This task does not involve complex text input or output that can be easily handled by an LLM. The LLM does not have the capability to physically ignite fuel or operate machinery. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM or any tools built on top of it.

2: E0
