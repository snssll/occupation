1: In this task, an Advertising and Promotions Manager is responsible for managing a sales team, which involves setting goals, providing incentives, and evaluating employee performance. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- Direct exposure (E1): The task involves a significant amount of text-based work, such as setting goals, providing feedback, and communicating with the sales team. An LLM could assist in drafting communication, providing feedback templates, or even generating performance evaluation reports based on input data. The LLM could also help in formulating sales goals based on historical data and market trends. Therefore, direct access to the LLM could reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality by at least half.
