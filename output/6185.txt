1: In this task, a Highway Maintenance Worker is required to erect, install, or repair various highway infrastructure components using hand tools and power tools. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM could significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality.

- The task involves physical work such as using hand tools and power tools, which cannot be directly replaced by the LLM.
- The task requires practical skills and knowledge related to construction and maintenance work, which are not typically within the scope of text-based tasks that the LLM excels at.
- The task involves on-site work that necessitates physical presence and interaction with the infrastructure, making it unsuitable for automation through the LLM.

Based on these considerations, it is evident that the task of erecting, installing, or repairing highway infrastructure components is not suitable for exposure to the LLM due to its physical nature and the requirement for practical skills beyond text-based capabilities.
