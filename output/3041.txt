1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of conducting research in a particular field of knowledge and publishing findings in professional journals, books, or electronic media as a postsecondary teacher, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves researching, analyzing information, and writing scholarly articles, which are all areas where the LLM can provide significant assistance. The LLM can help in conducting literature reviews, summarizing research articles, generating ideas for research, drafting manuscripts, and even providing feedback on writing. Given that the task heavily relies on text-based activities that the LLM excels at, it is likely that access to the LLM can reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality by at least half. Therefore, this task falls under label E1 - Direct exposure.
