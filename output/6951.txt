1: In this task, the Dining Room and Cafeteria Attendants and Bartender Helpers are responsible for filling beverage or ice dispensers. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. Filling beverage or ice dispensers is a physical task that involves manual labor and does not require complex decision-making or specialized knowledge beyond basic instructions. The task does not involve text input or output, and the context is straightforward. Therefore, there is no direct application of the LLM in completing this task. Additionally, developing software on top of the LLM to automate this physical task would not be feasible or practical. As a result, this task falls under E0 as it does not benefit from LLM capabilities.
