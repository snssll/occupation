1: In this task, the occupation involves Reservation and Transportation Ticket Agents and Travel Clerks who are responsible for various duties related to assisting customers with travel arrangements. The specific task mentioned is to keep information facilities clean during operation. To determine the exposure label for this task in relation to LLM, we need to consider if access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes for an average worker to complete this task with high quality.

- Direct exposure (E1): The task of keeping information facilities clean during operation does not involve complex text transformation, writing, summarizing, or any other text-based activities that the LLM could directly assist with. Therefore, direct access to the LLM may not reduce the time significantly for completing this task.

- Exposure by LLM-powered applications (E2): While it is conceivable that software could be developed on top of the LLM to potentially assist in organizing cleaning schedules or providing guidelines for maintaining cleanliness in information facilities, the direct impact on reducing the time for completing the task may not be substantial.

- Exposure given image capabilities (E3): Image capabilities would not be relevant for this task as it primarily involves physical cleaning tasks and does not require image processing or analysis.

Considering the above points, the task of keeping information facilities clean during operation is best classified as E0, as access to the LLM or LLM-powered tools would not significantly reduce the time it takes for an average worker to complete this task.
