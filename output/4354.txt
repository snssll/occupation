1: In this task, a Fuel Cell Engineer is required to design fuel cell systems, subsystems, stacks, assemblies, or components. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. Designing fuel cell systems involves a high level of technical expertise, knowledge of engineering principles, and understanding of fuel cell technology. While an LLM can provide general information about fuel cells and engineering concepts, it may not have the specialized domain knowledge required to design complex fuel cell systems. The task also involves practical considerations such as technical specifications, performance requirements, and safety standards, which may not be easily addressed by the LLM alone. Therefore, the task falls under E0 as it requires specialized domain knowledge and practical engineering skills that go beyond the capabilities of the LLM.

2: E0

3: High
