1: For the task of locating and correcting data entry errors or reporting them to supervisors as a Data Entry Keyer, the exposure to LLM can be evaluated as follows:

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** The task involves working with text data and making corrections based on specific guidelines. An LLM can assist in providing suggestions for correcting errors, generating reports, and even drafting communication to supervisors regarding the errors found. The LLM can help streamline the process of error detection and reporting, potentially reducing the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality by at least half.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the task can benefit from the direct assistance of an LLM, it may not require additional software beyond the LLM itself to achieve the desired outcome efficiently. The task is relatively straightforward and does not involve highly specialized domain knowledge or complex databases that would necessitate additional software development on top of the LLM.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Image capabilities are not relevant for this task as it primarily involves working with text data and does not require image processing for error correction or reporting.

Based on the above analysis, the task of locating and correcting data entry errors or reporting them to supervisors aligns best with **E1 (Direct exposure)** as the LLM can directly assist in completing the task more efficiently.
