1: In this task, a Sales Engineer is required to attend company training seminars to become familiar with product lines. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it. 

- E0: This task involves physical attendance at training seminars, which cannot be replaced by the LLM or any software tool. The task does not involve text input or output that the LLM could directly assist with.

- E1: The LLM could potentially assist in summarizing information from the training seminars, creating study materials, or generating questions for further clarification. However, the direct impact of the LLM on attending the seminars themselves is limited.

- E2: While the LLM could be used to create training materials based on general knowledge, it may not significantly reduce the time it takes to attend the seminars themselves. Additional software could potentially be developed to summarize training content, but the direct impact on attending the seminars is minimal.

- E3: The task does not involve image capabilities, so this label does not apply.

Based on the analysis, the most appropriate label for this task is E1.

2: E1

3: Moderate
