1: In this task, a First-Line Supervisor of Food Preparation and Serving Workers is responsible for purchasing or requisitioning supplies and equipment to ensure the quality and timely delivery of services. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we can break down the task as follows:

- The task involves text input (occupation title and task description) and text output (labeling the task).
- The context for the task is captured within the task description itself, which is well within the 2000-word limit for the LLM to understand.
- The task does not require drawing on up-to-date facts unless specific details about supplies or equipment are needed, which are likely to be included in the input.
- The task involves providing information and making decisions based on the information provided in the text input.

Based on these considerations, the task can be completed effectively using the LLM alone, as it involves processing text input, understanding the context, and generating a suitable label as output. Therefore, this task falls under the E1 exposure label.
