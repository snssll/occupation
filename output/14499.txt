1: In this task of repairing bent or torn sheet metal as a Farm Equipment Mechanics and Service Technicians, the exposure to LLM can be evaluated as follows:

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** The task of repairing bent or torn sheet metal involves hands-on work that requires physical manipulation of the metal. This task does not involve text input or output that can be easily processed by an LLM. Therefore, direct access to the LLM would not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While it is conceivable that specialized software could be developed to assist in providing repair instructions or techniques for specific types of sheet metal damage, the current capabilities of the LLM alone may not be sufficient to reduce the time it takes to complete this task by half.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** The task of repairing bent or torn sheet metal does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images. Therefore, the image capabilities of the LLM would not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task.

Based on the above analysis, the most appropriate label for this task would be **E0 (No exposure)**.

2: E0

3: High
