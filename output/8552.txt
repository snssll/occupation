1: In this task of investigating crimes on railroad property, the Transit and Railroad Police officer would need to gather information, interview witnesses, collect evidence, and potentially make arrests. The task involves a significant amount of written documentation, such as reports, statements, and evidence logs. An LLM could assist in writing reports, summarizing witness statements, generating questions for interviews, and providing feedback on investigation strategies. The LLM could also help in researching relevant laws and regulations. However, the task also involves physical aspects such as visiting crime scenes, securing evidence, and making arrests, which the LLM cannot directly assist with. Therefore, while the LLM can aid in several aspects of the investigation, it cannot fully replace the physical and hands-on aspects of the job.
