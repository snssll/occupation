1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of designing energy-efficient or environmentally sound civil structures as a Civil Engineer, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves a high level of expertise in civil engineering, including knowledge of energy efficiency and environmental considerations. The LLM can provide general information on energy-efficient design principles and environmentally friendly materials based on existing knowledge within its training data. However, designing specific civil structures requires specialized domain knowledge, understanding of local building codes, and detailed calculations that the LLM may not have access to. While the LLM can assist in generating ideas or providing general guidance, it cannot replace the expertise and experience required for this task. Therefore, this task falls under E2 - Exposure by LLM-powered applications, as additional software could potentially be developed to assist Civil Engineers in generating design ideas or providing recommendations based on the LLM's capabilities.
