1: In this task, an Insulation Worker is required to fit, wrap, staple, or glue insulating materials to structures or surfaces using hand tools or wires. This task involves physical work that cannot be directly replaced by an LLM. The task requires manual dexterity, physical strength, and the ability to work with tools and materials in a hands-on manner. The LLM does not have the capability to physically interact with structures or surfaces, staple materials, or glue materials. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it cannot be significantly aided by the LLM or any tools built on top of it.
