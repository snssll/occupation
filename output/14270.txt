1: In this task, a Web and Digital Interface Designer is responsible for registering websites with search engines to enhance website traffic. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we can break down the task:
- The task involves interacting with search engines and understanding their registration processes.
- It requires knowledge of search engine optimization (SEO) techniques to improve website visibility.
- The task may involve writing meta tags, descriptions, and other website elements to optimize search engine rankings.
- The task could benefit from the LLM's ability to provide up-to-date information on search engine algorithms and best practices for website registration.

Considering these points, the task falls under E2 exposure. While the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time to complete the task, additional software built on top of the LLM could streamline the process by summarizing the latest SEO trends, providing recommendations for website optimization, and automating certain registration steps.
