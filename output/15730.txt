1: In this task, a Helper-Roofer is responsible for setting up ladders, scaffolds, and hoists to transport supplies to roofs. This task does not involve any direct text input or output that can be easily processed by an LLM. The task is physical in nature and requires manual labor and coordination. While an LLM could potentially provide information on how to set up these structures, the actual physical work cannot be replaced by text-based instructions alone. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not benefit from the capabilities of an LLM.
