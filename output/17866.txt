1: In this task, a Penetration Tester is required to write audit reports to communicate technical and procedural findings and recommend solutions. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- Writing audit reports involves transforming technical and procedural findings into a coherent written format. The LLM can assist in generating detailed and well-structured reports based on the input data provided.
- The LLM can help in summarizing the findings, providing recommendations, and ensuring the report is well-organized and clear.
- While the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to draft the initial report, it may not have the domain-specific knowledge required to provide accurate technical details without input.
- The task does not involve image processing or specialized visual data, so E3 is not applicable.

Based on these considerations, the task of writing audit reports for Penetration Testers falls under E1 as the LLM can substantially reduce the time required to complete the task with equivalent quality by assisting in writing and transforming text according to complex instructions.
