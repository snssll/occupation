1: In this task, a Control and Valve Installer and Repairer is responsible for cleaning various substances from meter housings using tools like wire brushes, scrapers, buffers, and cleaning compounds. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be completed more efficiently with the help of the language model. Since this task involves physical cleaning using tools, it does not directly involve text input or output that the LLM can assist with. The task does not require complex text transformation, writing, summarization, or any other text-based activities that the LLM excels at. Therefore, the task does not align with any of the exposure levels in the rubric.

2: E0
