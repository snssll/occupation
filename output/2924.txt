1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of conducting individual in-room visits with residents as a Recreation Worker, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be supported by the capabilities of the LLM. 

- The task involves direct interaction with residents, which requires physical presence and human-to-human communication. This aspect of the task cannot be automated or significantly enhanced by the LLM.
- While the LLM could potentially assist in preparing materials for the visits, such as creating personalized activity plans or generating conversation prompts, the core activity of conducting the visits itself relies heavily on interpersonal skills and physical presence.
- The LLM may be able to provide general guidance on effective communication strategies or activity ideas, but the nuanced and individualized nature of in-room visits with residents would likely require human judgment and empathy.

Based on these considerations, the task of conducting individual in-room visits with residents as a Recreation Worker would be classified as E0 - No exposure to LLM.
