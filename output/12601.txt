1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of preparing nail cuticles as a Manicurist or Pedicurist, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be impacted by the use of the LLM. In this case, the task involves a hands-on, physical procedure that requires manual dexterity and precision. The task does not involve text input or output, and the expertise required is practical and skill-based rather than knowledge-based. The LLM cannot physically perform the task of preparing nail cuticles, as it requires tools and techniques that are beyond the capabilities of a language model. Therefore, the task does not fall under E1, E2, or E3 categories as the LLM cannot directly assist in completing the task.
