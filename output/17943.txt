1: In this task, the worker needs to write programs for CNC machines to cut metal and plastic materials. This involves a high level of technical knowledge and expertise in programming CNC machines. The task requires understanding the specifications for cutting different materials, the intricacies of CNC programming, and ensuring the accuracy and efficiency of the cutting process. While the LLM can assist in providing general information about CNC programming and cutting materials, it may not have the specialized knowledge required to write specific programs for CNC machines tailored to the materials being used. Additionally, the task involves practical considerations such as machine setup and calibration, which may not be easily addressed by the LLM. Therefore, the task is highly specialized and requires hands-on technical expertise beyond what the LLM can provide.
