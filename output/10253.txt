1: In this task, a Radio, Cellular, and Tower Equipment Installer and Repairer is required to mount equipment on transmission towers and in vehicles. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be significantly aided by the use of the language model. Since this task involves physical work such as climbing towers and installing equipment, it does not directly involve text-based activities that the LLM can assist with. The task does not involve writing, summarizing, analyzing text, or any other activity that the LLM is designed for. Therefore, the task does not align with any of the exposure levels E1, E2, or E3.

2: E0

3: High
