1: In this task, a flight attendant is required to direct and assist passengers in emergency procedures, such as evacuating a plane following an emergency landing. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone or with additional software could significantly reduce the time it takes for a worker to complete this task with high quality.

- E0: This task involves physical actions and interactions that cannot be replaced by text-based tools like the LLM. It requires hands-on assistance and guidance during emergency situations, which cannot be simulated or replaced by the LLM.
- E1: While the LLM could potentially provide written guidance on emergency procedures, it cannot physically assist passengers in evacuating a plane. The critical nature of this task requires real-time, hands-on assistance that the LLM cannot provide.
- E2: It is challenging to imagine additional software built on top of the LLM that could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task. Emergency procedures in aviation require immediate physical action and human interaction, which cannot be replicated by software.
- E3: The task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images. The nature of the task is more focused on physical actions and interactions rather than text or image processing.

Based on the above analysis, the most appropriate label for this task is E0.

2: E0

3: High
