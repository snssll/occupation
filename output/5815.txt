1: In this task, a recreation worker is required to document individuals' progress toward meeting their treatment goals. To complete this task, the worker would need to record information about the individuals, their treatment goals, and their progress. This task involves writing and transforming text according to specific instructions, maintaining records of written data, and potentially providing feedback on the progress documented. The task does not involve highly specialized domain knowledge or complex databases. The information needed to document progress is likely to be captured within the 2000-word context limit of the LLM. Therefore, direct access to the LLM could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality.
