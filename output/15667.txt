1: In this task, a Child, Family, and School Social Worker serves as a liaison between various parties to help children facing problems such as disabilities, abuse, or poverty. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if the task can be significantly expedited or improved by using the LLM. The LLM could potentially assist in generating reports, drafting communication materials, summarizing case information, or providing guidance on best practices in social work. However, the task primarily involves human interaction, empathy, and decision-making based on complex social dynamics, which are not easily replicable by an AI model. While the LLM could provide some support in drafting written materials, the core of the task involves nuanced human interactions and decision-making that cannot be fully automated.
