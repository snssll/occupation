1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of training new workers in the occupation of Postal Service Mail Sorters, Processors, and Processing Machine Operators, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be aided by the use of the OpenAI large language model (LLM).

- E1: Direct exposure - The task of training new workers involves providing instructions, guidance, and possibly creating training materials. The LLM can assist in generating training materials, writing instructions, and even answering questions related to the training process. The model can help in creating training manuals, quizzes, or other educational materials to facilitate the training process.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM can assist in generating text-based training materials, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to provide interactive training modules, simulations, or personalized training plans. Such software could enhance the training process further by incorporating multimedia elements or interactive components.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Since the task of training new workers primarily involves text-based instructions and materials, the image capabilities of the LLM are not essential for this specific task. The use of images is not a significant aspect of training new workers in this context.

Based on the above analysis, the task of training new workers in the occupation of Postal Service Mail Sorters, Processors, and Processing Machine Operators is best classified as E1: Direct exposure.
