1: In this task, a Computer User Support Specialist is required to inspect equipment and read order sheets to prepare for delivery to users. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it. 

- The task involves inspecting equipment and reading order sheets, which are straightforward activities that do not require complex decision-making or specialized domain knowledge.
- The LLM could potentially assist by providing guidance on how to inspect equipment effectively or by summarizing information from order sheets.
- The LLM could generate checklists for equipment inspection or help in organizing and prioritizing tasks based on the order sheets.
- The task does not involve highly specialized domain knowledge or complex databases, so the assistance needed from the LLM would be more straightforward.

Based on these considerations, the task of inspecting equipment and reading order sheets for delivery preparation could benefit from the direct access to the LLM, as it can provide guidance, checklists, and assistance in organizing tasks efficiently.
