1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of delivering oral or written presentations of mathematical modeling and data analysis as a Data Scientist, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be supported by the capabilities of the LLM.

- Data Scientists often need to communicate complex findings and insights from their analyses to various stakeholders, including management and end users.
- The LLM can assist in generating written reports, summarizing key findings, and even providing suggestions for structuring presentations.
- The LLM can help in crafting clear and concise explanations of technical concepts, which can be useful for oral presentations.
- While the LLM can aid in preparing the content for presentations, it may not directly reduce the time it takes to deliver oral presentations, as this involves additional skills such as public speaking and engaging with the audience.

Considering these points, the task of delivering oral or written presentations as a Data Scientist could be classified as E2. While the LLM can assist in preparing the content for the presentations, additional software that integrates with the LLM to provide presentation templates, speech suggestions, or interactive presentation tools could further enhance the efficiency of this task.
