1: In this task, the main responsibility is to clean rooms and make beds, which involves physical actions such as tidying up the space and arranging the bedding. These actions cannot be directly performed by an LLM or any software tool. While an LLM could potentially provide guidance on the best practices for cleaning and bed-making, it cannot physically carry out these tasks. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not involve any text-based or image-based activities that could be significantly expedited by the use of an LLM.
