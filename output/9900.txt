1: In this task, a Computer Network Architect is required to monitor and analyze network performance, report on data input or output, detect problems, identify inefficient use of computer resources, and perform capacity planning. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- Writing and transforming text: The task involves analyzing data input and output, which may require writing reports based on the analysis. LLM can assist in generating these reports based on the data provided.
- Providing feedback on documents: LLM can help in providing insights and feedback on the network performance reports generated.
- Analyzing written information to inform decisions: LLM can assist in analyzing the network performance data to inform decisions regarding network optimization and capacity planning.

Considering the above points, the task can benefit from the direct access to LLM by reducing the time it takes to complete the analysis, generate reports, and make informed decisions based on the data provided.
