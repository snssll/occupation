1: In this task, a Food and Tobacco Roasting, Baking, and Drying Machine Operator and Tender is required to start conveyors to move roasted grain to cooling pans and agitate the grain with rakes as blowers force air through perforated bottoms of pans. This task involves physical actions such as starting conveyors, moving grain, and agitating it with rakes. These actions cannot be directly performed by an LLM or any software tool. The task also does not involve text-based inputs or outputs that could be easily processed by an LLM. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM or any software tool that could be developed on top of it.
