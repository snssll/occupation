1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of presenting water resource proposals to various groups as a Water Resource Specialist, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it.

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM could assist in writing and refining the content of the water resource proposals based on complex instructions. It could help in structuring the proposals, providing supporting data, and ensuring clarity in the presentation. Additionally, the LLM could aid in crafting responses to potential questions or concerns that may arise during the presentation.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to streamline the process. This software could potentially summarize relevant data, retrieve up-to-date information on water resources, and provide recommendations for the proposals based on data analysis.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities would not significantly impact the task of presenting water resource proposals, as the task primarily involves verbal communication and written materials rather than visual content.

Based on the above analysis, the task of presenting water resource proposals to various groups as a Water Resource Specialist is best classified as E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications.
