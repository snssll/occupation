1: In this task, the occupation involves preparing for classes and showing written evidence of preparation upon request. With the help of the LLM, a teacher could potentially generate detailed lesson plans, create teaching materials, and document their preparation process. The LLM could assist in writing detailed explanations, providing examples, and even suggesting activities for the class. However, the task does not involve complex data analysis, specialized domain knowledge, or image processing. Therefore, the LLM's capabilities in generating text and assisting in lesson planning align well with the requirements of this task.

Considering the task involves primarily text-based activities related to lesson preparation, the LLM's ability to generate written content and assist in organizing class materials would significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task. The LLM can help in creating detailed lesson plans, writing explanations, and suggesting activities, all of which are crucial for class preparation. Thus, the task falls under the E1 label as direct access to the LLM can reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality by at least half.
