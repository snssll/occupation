1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of scheduling work with customers and initiating work orders, house requisitions, and orders from stock for Heating, Air Conditioning, and Refrigeration Mechanics and Installers, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The task involves writing and transforming text (scheduling work orders, requisitions, etc.) according to specific instructions. The LLM can assist in generating and organizing this text efficiently, potentially reducing the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality by at least half.
  
- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the task may not be significantly enhanced by additional software beyond the LLM, it is conceivable that specialized software could be developed to integrate with the LLM for managing scheduling, work orders, and stock orders in a more automated and efficient manner, potentially reducing the time to complete the task by half.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not relevant for this task as it primarily involves text-based activities related to scheduling and initiating work orders.
