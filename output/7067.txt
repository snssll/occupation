1: In this task, the occupation involves physically manipulating structural steel members into their final positions using tools like turnbuckles, crowbars, jacks, or hand tools. This task is very hands-on and requires physical strength and dexterity. The task does not involve any text input or output, and the context is entirely based on physical actions. The LLM, even with additional software, cannot directly manipulate physical objects or perform tasks that require physical strength. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM or any software that could be developed on top of it.

2: E0

3: High
