1: In this task, a retail salesperson is responsible for ticketing, arranging, and displaying merchandise to promote sales. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone or with additional software could significantly reduce the time it takes for a retail salesperson to complete this task with equivalent quality.

- E1: Direct access to the LLM could potentially help in generating ideas for creative merchandise displays, drafting promotional text for tickets, or providing suggestions for arranging products effectively. The LLM could assist in writing descriptions or promotional material, which could save time for the salesperson.

- E2: While the LLM alone may not reduce the time significantly for this task, additional software built on top of the LLM could potentially be developed to provide real-time market trends, customer preferences, or inventory management suggestions. Such software could enhance the salesperson's ability to arrange and display merchandise effectively based on data-driven insights.

- E3: Image capabilities could be less relevant for this task as it primarily involves text-based activities like ticketing and arranging merchandise. The task does not require detailed image analysis or creation.
