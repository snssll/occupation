1: In this task, a massage therapist is responsible for maintaining the massage areas by restocking supplies or sanitizing equipment. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. This task involves physical actions such as restocking supplies and sanitizing equipment, which cannot be directly performed by an LLM. While the LLM could potentially provide guidance on best practices for sanitizing equipment or creating a checklist for restocking supplies, the actual physical actions would still need to be carried out by a human. Therefore, this task does not fall under E1, E2, or E3 as it involves physical maintenance activities that cannot be directly performed by the LLM.
