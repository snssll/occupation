1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of investigating the nature, composition, or expression of genes or researching how genetic engineering can impact these processes as a Biochemist or Biophysicist, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The LLM can assist in tasks that involve writing, summarizing, providing feedback, answering questions, and generating content based on existing knowledge. In this case, the task involves research and analysis in the field of genetics, which may require specialized domain knowledge, data retrieval, and making recommendations based on complex scientific information. While the LLM can provide general information on genetics, it may not have the specialized domain knowledge or up-to-date data required for in-depth research in biochemistry and biophysics. Therefore, this task falls under E2, as additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to enhance its capabilities for assisting with complex scientific research tasks.
