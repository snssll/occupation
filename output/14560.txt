1: In this task, a Heating, Air Conditioning, and Refrigeration Mechanic and Installer is required to repair or service HVAC systems to improve efficiency. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves practical, hands-on work such as changing filters, cleaning ducts, and refilling refrigerants. These activities require physical interaction with HVAC systems and equipment, which cannot be performed by an LLM. Additionally, the task involves technical knowledge and skills related to HVAC systems that go beyond text-based information that an LLM can provide. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not involve activities that can be significantly aided by an LLM.
