1: In this task, a Helper-Roofer is responsible for attaching sheets of metal to roof boards or building frameworks during the installation of metal roofs. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. This task involves physical labor, such as climbing onto roofs, handling metal sheets, and using tools to secure them in place. It requires manual dexterity, physical strength, and the ability to work at heights safely. Since the task is hands-on and involves physical actions that cannot be directly performed by an LLM or any software tool, it falls under the E0 category. The task does not involve text input or output, and the complexity lies in the physical execution rather than in information processing.
