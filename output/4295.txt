1: In this task, the orthodontist is responsible for designing and fabricating various dental appliances. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. Designing and fabricating dental appliances involve a high level of specialized knowledge and expertise in orthodontics. The task requires understanding the patient's specific needs, dental anatomy, and treatment goals to create custom appliances that fit correctly and address orthodontic issues effectively. While the task involves creativity and precision, it does not directly involve text-based inputs or outputs that could be easily processed by an LLM. The task also does not involve accessing up-to-date information or complex databases that could benefit from LLM capabilities. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not align with the criteria for exposure to LLM capabilities.
