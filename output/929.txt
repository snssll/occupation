1: In this task, the bartender is required to arrange bottles and glasses to create visually appealing displays. This task involves a hands-on, physical aspect that cannot be directly performed by an LLM. While the LLM could potentially provide suggestions or ideas for attractive displays through text input, the actual arranging of physical objects would still need to be done manually. Therefore, this task does not fall under any of the exposure categories in the rubric.
