1: For the task of performing personnel activities such as supervising and training employees as a Fast Food and Counter Worker, the exposure to LLM can be evaluated as follows:

- E0: This task involves a high degree of human interaction and decision-making that impacts human livelihood. LLMs cannot make decisions that might impact human livelihood, so this task would not be suitable for automation using LLMs.

- E1: LLMs can assist in writing training materials or providing general information related to personnel activities, but the core tasks of supervising and training employees require human judgment, empathy, and interaction, which cannot be effectively replaced by LLMs.

- E2: While LLMs could potentially assist in generating training materials or providing general advice on personnel activities, the complex nature of supervising and training employees in a fast-food setting involves real-time decision-making, understanding individual needs, and adapting to various situations, which may not be effectively automated by LLM-powered tools alone.

- E3: LLMs do not have the capability to view, caption, or create images, and the task of supervising and training employees does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images. Therefore, this task does not fall under E3.

2: E0

3: High
