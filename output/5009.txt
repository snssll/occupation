1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of developing or enforcing procedures for the normal operation of manufacturing systems as an Industrial Production Manager, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be impacted by the use of an LLM.

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** If the task involves writing and transforming text to document these procedures, providing edits to existing procedures, or summarizing documents related to manufacturing systems, then direct access to an LLM could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality. The LLM can assist in generating detailed procedures, editing existing ones, or summarizing relevant documents.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While an LLM alone may not reduce the time it takes to complete the task by half, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to summarize longer documents, retrieve up-to-date information related to manufacturing systems, or provide recommendations based on data analysis. This additional software could enhance the capabilities of the LLM for this task.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Image capabilities would not significantly impact the task of developing or enforcing procedures for manufacturing systems, as it primarily involves text-based work rather than image processing.

Considering the task involves working with text-based procedures for manufacturing systems, the most suitable label appears to be **E1 (Direct exposure)** as the LLM can assist in writing, transforming, and summarizing text related to these procedures.
