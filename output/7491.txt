1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of identifying or procuring needed resources to implement sustainability programs or projects as a Sustainability Specialist, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be impacted by the use of the LLM.

- The task involves researching and identifying resources required for sustainability initiatives, which can involve searching for specific information, analyzing data, and making recommendations based on findings.
- The LLM can assist in researching and providing information related to sustainability programs, such as best practices, case studies, and potential resources available.
- The LLM can help in generating ideas for sustainable resources, providing insights on current trends in sustainability, and even drafting communication materials for procurement purposes.
- While the LLM can aid in information retrieval and idea generation, the task may also require human judgment, negotiation skills, and interaction with stakeholders, which the LLM may not be able to fully replicate.

Based on these considerations, the task of identifying or procuring needed resources to implement sustainability programs or projects as a Sustainability Specialist falls under **E2 - Exposure by LLM-powered applications**. While the LLM can provide valuable information and insights to support the task, additional software or tools tailored to sustainability resource procurement could further enhance the efficiency of completing this task.
