1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of planning and preparing work schedules and assigning employees to specific duties for First-Line Supervisors of Non-Retail Sales Workers, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be facilitated by the use of an LLM.

- This task involves organizing and structuring information related to work schedules and employee assignments.
- An LLM can assist in generating text-based schedules and duty assignments based on input criteria provided by the supervisor.

Considering these points, this task falls under E1 as the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality by assisting in writing and transforming text according to complex instructions, providing edits to existing text following specifications, and maintaining records of written data.
