1: In this task, a taper is responsible for spreading sealing compound between boards or panels or over cracks, holes, nail heads, or screw heads using tools like trowels, broadknives, or spatulas. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. Since this task involves manual labor and physical interaction with materials, it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM. The LLM cannot perform physical tasks or interact with physical objects. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not benefit from the use of the LLM or any tools built on top of it.

2: E0

3: High
