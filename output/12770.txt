1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of preparing sales presentations or proposals for technical and scientific products, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves writing and transforming text to explain product specifications or applications, which falls within the LLM's ability to generate text based on input. The LLM can assist in crafting detailed and informative content for sales presentations or proposals, potentially reducing the time and effort required to create these documents manually. However, the task does not involve any specialized domain knowledge or complex databases that would require additional software beyond the LLM itself. Therefore, the task could benefit from the direct access to the LLM, making it suitable for label E1.
