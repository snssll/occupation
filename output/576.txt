To complete this task, the manager needs to have a good understanding of the organization's current processes, potential areas for improvement, and the impact of any changes on operations. The LLM can assist in providing information on best practices for process improvement, examples of successful policy changes in similar organizations, and potential challenges to consider when implementing changes. The model can also help in drafting communication materials to present recommendations to stakeholders.
