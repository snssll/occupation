1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of obtaining and studying information about clients' products, needs, problems, advertising history, and business practices as an Advertising Sales Agent, we need to consider the nature of the task. This task involves gathering and analyzing information to tailor sales presentations and provide product assistance effectively. An LLM could assist in researching and summarizing information about clients' products, needs, and business practices, potentially saving time in gathering relevant data. The LLM could also help in generating insights or recommendations based on the information gathered. However, since this task involves understanding specific client contexts and nuances, as well as potentially interacting with clients directly, the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with high quality. Therefore, this task falls under E2 as having access to additional software that could be developed on top of the LLM might further streamline the process by providing more tailored insights and recommendations.
