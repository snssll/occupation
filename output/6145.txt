1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of entering customers' transactions into computers as a teller, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. In this task, the LLM could potentially assist in providing guidance on how to accurately record transactions, troubleshoot common issues that arise during transaction entry, or even generate responses to customer inquiries related to their transactions. The LLM could also help in summarizing transaction data or generating reports based on the entered transactions. However, since this task involves direct data entry into a computer system, which is a manual and repetitive process, the LLM may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with high quality. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as the LLM alone may not provide a substantial time-saving benefit for an experienced worker performing this task.
