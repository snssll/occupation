1: In this task, a waiter or waitress is responsible for preparing checks that itemize and total meal costs and sales taxes. With the help of a large language model (LLM), the waiter or waitress could potentially automate the process of calculating the total meal costs and sales taxes based on the items ordered by the customers. The LLM could assist in accurately calculating the costs, applying the appropriate sales tax rate, and generating an itemized check for the customers. This task involves writing and transforming text (the check) based on specific instructions (meal costs and sales taxes). The LLM could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality by automating the calculations and generating the check.
