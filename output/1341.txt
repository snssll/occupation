1: In this task of assisting with patient resuscitation during cardiac arrest or other life-threatening events as a Surgical Assistant, the primary focus is on providing immediate medical support and interventions to stabilize the patient's condition. This task involves hands-on medical procedures, such as performing CPR, administering medications, and assisting with airway management. The task does not involve extensive written or spoken communication that could be easily automated by an LLM.
