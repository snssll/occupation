1: In this task, a Fast Food and Counter Worker is responsible for setting up dining areas for meals and clearing them following meals. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it. 

- E0: This task involves physical actions such as setting up and clearing dining areas, which cannot be directly assisted by the LLM or any software tools. The task also does not involve complex decision-making or specialized knowledge that the LLM could provide. Therefore, this task does not fit into any of the exposure categories.
