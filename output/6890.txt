1: In this task, the occupation of riggers involves fabricating, setting up, and repairing rigging, supporting structures, hoists, and pulling gear using hand and power tools. This task is very hands-on and physical, requiring the manipulation of tools and equipment in a physical environment. The task does not involve text input or output, and the context is primarily focused on manual labor and technical skills related to rigging. As such, there is no clear way for the LLM to directly assist in completing this task as it does not involve writing, summarizing, analyzing text, or any other form of information processing that the LLM excels at. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as the LLM cannot significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete the task.
