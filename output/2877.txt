1: In this task, a Soil and Plant Scientist is conducting experiments to develop new or improved varieties of field crops. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be significantly aided by the use of the language model. The task involves conducting experiments, which requires hands-on work, data collection, analysis, and field knowledge. While the LLM can provide information on agricultural practices, crop varieties, and scientific concepts related to soil and plants, it cannot physically conduct experiments or gather real-time data from the field. The task is highly specialized and requires practical skills beyond text-based information retrieval.
