1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of researching, testing, or verifying the proper functioning of software patches and fixes as a Computer Systems Engineer/Architect, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can benefit from the use of a large language model (LLM).

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** In this task, a Computer Systems Engineer/Architect may need to write reports, document findings, or communicate with team members regarding the software patches and fixes. An LLM could significantly reduce the time spent on writing reports, summarizing test results, or drafting communications related to the testing process. The LLM can help in generating detailed reports, summarizing test outcomes, or even drafting emails for communication purposes.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the task involves research, testing, and verification, which could potentially benefit from an LLM's ability to provide information and insights, the specific nature of the task may not require highly specialized domain knowledge or complex data analysis beyond what the LLM can offer on its own. However, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to streamline the testing process, automate certain aspects of verification, or provide recommendations based on the test results.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** This task does not involve image processing, so the image capabilities of the LLM would not significantly impact the completion of the task.

Considering the above points, the task of researching, testing, or verifying the proper functioning of software patches and fixes as a Computer Systems Engineer/Architect could benefit from the direct exposure of an LLM (E1) due to its potential to assist in writing reports, summarizing findings, and facilitating communication related to the testing process.
