1: In this task, a Surveying and Mapping Technician is required to supervise or coordinate activities of workers engaged in surveying, plotting data, drafting maps, or producing blueprints, photostats, or photographs. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- Direct exposure (E1): The task involves supervising and coordinating activities, which may require human judgment, decision-making, and interaction with other workers. While an LLM could potentially assist in generating text-based instructions or providing information related to surveying and mapping, the core aspect of supervising and coordinating workers may not be effectively handled by the LLM alone.

- Exposure by LLM-powered applications (E2): It is conceivable that additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to assist in generating reports, analyzing data, or providing recommendations based on surveying and mapping information. This software could potentially streamline some aspects of the task, such as data analysis or report generation.

- Exposure given image capabilities (E3): Since the task involves producing blueprints, photostats, or photographs, having access to image capabilities along with the LLM could potentially aid in creating or editing digital images according to instructions. This could enhance the efficiency of producing visual materials required in surveying and mapping activities.

Based on the above considerations, the task of supervising or coordinating activities of workers engaged in surveying, plotting data, drafting maps, or producing blueprints, photostats, or photographs could be best classified as Exposure given image capabilities (E3).
