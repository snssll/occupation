1: In this task, a First-Line Supervisor of Security Workers is responsible for training security personnel on various procedures and duties. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality. 

- E1: Direct exposure - If the task involves writing training materials, providing feedback on documents related to training, or generating questions for assessments, the LLM could be used to assist in these text-based tasks. The LLM could help in summarizing information, drafting training materials, or generating questions for assessments, potentially reducing the time needed to complete these aspects of the task.
  
- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not reduce the time to complete the task by half, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to summarize longer documents, provide recommendations based on training materials, or analyze written information to inform training decisions. This additional software could enhance the efficiency of training security personnel.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities would not significantly impact the training aspect of this task, as it primarily involves text-based training materials and procedures. Therefore, image capabilities are not relevant in this context.
