1: In this task, a First-Line Supervisor of Landscaping, Lawn Service, and Groundskeeping Workers is required to tour grounds to inspect the conditions of plants and soil. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be significantly aided by the use of the language model. The task involves physical inspection and assessment of plants and soil conditions, which cannot be directly assisted by the LLM. While the LLM could potentially provide information on plant care or soil conditions, it cannot replace the physical inspection aspect of the task. Therefore, the task does not align with any of the exposure levels that involve text-based or image-based assistance from the LLM.
