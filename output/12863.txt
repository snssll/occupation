1: In this task, the Appraisers and Assessors of Real Estate are required to prepare written reports estimating property values. To complete this task, they need to gather data, analyze it, apply valuation methods, and adhere to appraisal standards. With access to the powerful OpenAI large language model (LLM), the appraisers could potentially benefit from the model's ability to assist in writing and transforming text, providing edits to existing text following specifications, and summarizing documents. The LLM could help in generating detailed explanations of the valuation methods used, ensuring compliance with appraisal standards, and enhancing the overall quality of the written reports. However, since this task involves specialized domain knowledge and specific guidelines that the LLM may not inherently possess, additional software tailored to real estate appraisal standards and methodologies would be needed to fully automate the process. Therefore, the task falls under E2 as having access to the LLM alone may not reduce the time significantly, but additional software could be developed to streamline the process.
