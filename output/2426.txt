1: In this task, a Recycling and Reclamation Worker is responsible for collecting recyclable materials from curbside and delivering them to designated facilities. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be aided by the LLM. 

- The task involves physical work such as collecting materials, which cannot be directly assisted by the LLM.
- While the LLM could potentially provide information on recycling processes, regulations, or best practices, the core task of physically collecting materials cannot be significantly aided by the LLM.
- The task does not involve complex decision-making, specialized domain knowledge, or detailed data analysis that would require the capabilities of the LLM.
- The task does not involve written text or documents that could benefit from summarization, translation, or analysis by the LLM.

Based on these considerations, the task of collecting recyclable materials from curbside for delivery to designated facilities is best classified as E0 - No exposure to LLM.
