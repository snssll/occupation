1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of computing and authorizing amounts of assistance for government programs as an Eligibility Interviewer, we need to consider the level of exposure to LLM.

- E1: Direct exposure - If the task involves writing and transforming text or code according to complex instructions, providing edits to existing text following specifications, or generating questions for an interview, then direct access to the LLM could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality.
- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - If additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to summarize documents longer than 2000 words, retrieve up-to-date facts from the internet, or provide recommendations based on data, then the task may fall under this category.
- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - If the task involves reading text from PDFs or scanning images, access to image capabilities along with the LLM could significantly reduce the time to complete the task.

Considering the task of computing and authorizing amounts of assistance for government programs, it does not directly align with tasks that can be easily automated by the LLM alone. While the LLM could potentially assist in generating written content or providing recommendations based on data, the task itself involves decision-making and authorization that may require human judgment beyond what the LLM can provide.
