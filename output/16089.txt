1: For the task of specifying power supply requirements and configuration as a Software Developer, the exposure to LLM can be evaluated as follows:

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** If the task involves researching and understanding different power supply options, voltage requirements, configurations, and best practices, the LLM can assist in providing detailed information, guidelines, and recommendations based on the input provided. The LLM can help in generating text related to power supply specifications, technical details, and potential configurations, which can significantly reduce the time it takes to gather this information manually.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the LLM alone may not reduce the time to complete the task by half, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to create tools specifically tailored for specifying power supply requirements and configurations. These tools could integrate with existing databases of power supply information, provide real-time updates on new technologies, and offer advanced analysis capabilities based on the data processed by the LLM.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** This task does not involve image processing or detailed visual analysis, so the image capabilities of the LLM would not significantly impact the completion time for specifying power supply requirements and configuration.

Based on the above analysis, the task of specifying power supply requirements and configuration as a Software Developer is best classified as **E1 (Direct exposure)**.
