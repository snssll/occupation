1: In this task, a Self-Enrichment Teacher is required to observe students to determine various individual characteristics such as qualifications, limitations, abilities, interests, etc. This task involves a significant amount of human interaction and nuanced observation skills that an LLM alone cannot replicate. While the LLM could potentially assist in generating reports or summaries based on the observations provided by the teacher, the core task of observing and understanding individual characteristics requires human judgment and interaction. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not significantly benefit from the capabilities of the LLM.
