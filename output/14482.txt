1: In this task, the Amusement and Recreation Attendants are responsible for renting, selling, or issuing sporting equipment and supplies. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if the task can be significantly expedited or improved by using the LLM. The task involves physical interactions such as handling equipment, interacting with customers, and managing inventory. These aspects require human presence and cannot be effectively replaced by the LLM. While the LLM could potentially assist in generating written materials like rental agreements or inventory lists, the core activities of renting, selling, and issuing equipment are primarily physical and interpersonal, making it unsuitable for automation by the LLM.
