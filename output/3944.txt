1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of creating content strategies for digital media as a Search Marketing Strategist, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM in assisting with this task. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM can help in generating content ideas, providing insights on keywords and trends, and even drafting content pieces based on given parameters. It can assist in brainstorming and structuring content strategies effectively.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not reduce the time significantly for creating content strategies, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to analyze data, trends, and user behavior to tailor content strategies more efficiently.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not directly relevant to creating content strategies for digital media, so this label does not apply to this task.

Considering the above points, the task of creating content strategies for digital media aligns best with E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications.
