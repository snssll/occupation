1: In this task, the occupation of embalmers involves closing incisions using needles and sutures. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes for an average worker to complete this task with high quality. 

- E0: This task involves a hands-on, physical procedure that requires precision and skill. The use of an LLM or LLM-powered tool would not be able to perform the physical act of closing incisions using needles and sutures. Therefore, this task does not fit into any of the exposure categories that involve text-based or image-based tasks.
