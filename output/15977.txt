1: In this task, a Cement Mason and Concrete Finisher is responsible for signaling the truck driver to position the truck correctly for pouring concrete and moving the chute to direct the concrete onto forms. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. This task involves physical coordination and communication with the truck driver, which cannot be directly performed by an LLM. The task requires on-site presence, physical movement, and real-time decision-making based on the concrete pouring process. As such, this task falls under the category of E0 as it involves physical actions and interactions that cannot be replaced by an LLM.
