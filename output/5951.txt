1: In this task, a Structural Iron and Steel Worker is required to drive drift pins through rivet holes to align them with corresponding holes in structural steel members. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. This task involves physical work that requires manual dexterity and precision to align the rivet holes accurately. It does not involve writing, summarizing, analyzing text, or any other activity that can be directly assisted by an LLM. The task also does not involve the use of images or any specialized knowledge that could be leveraged by an LLM. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not align with any of the exposure levels described in the rubric.

2: E0

3: High
