1: In this task, a First-Line Supervisor of Correctional Officers is responsible for monitoring the behavior of their subordinates to ensure they exhibit alert, courteous, and professional behavior towards various individuals. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves observing and evaluating human behavior, which requires a high degree of human interaction and judgment. It also involves assessing non-verbal cues, tone of voice, and other subtle indicators of behavior, which may not be effectively captured by a language model alone. Additionally, the task involves real-time monitoring and intervention, which may not be easily automated by an LLM. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not clearly benefit from the capabilities of an LLM to reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete the task.
