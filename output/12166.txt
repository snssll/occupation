1: In this task, an Automotive Body and Related Repairer is required to position dolly blocks against surfaces of dented areas and beat opposite surfaces to remove dents using hammers. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if access to the LLM or LLM-powered tools can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality.

- E0: This task involves physical work that cannot be replaced by text-based instructions or tools. The nature of the task requires hands-on manipulation of tools and direct interaction with the vehicle, making it unsuitable for automation through an LLM.

- E1: While an LLM could potentially provide information on techniques for dent removal or safety precautions, the core aspect of physically positioning dolly blocks and using hammers to remove dents cannot be directly assisted by text-based instructions. The hands-on nature of the task limits the applicability of the LLM in this context.

- E2: It is challenging to imagine additional software built on top of the LLM that could automate the physical process of dent removal using dolly blocks and hammers. The task is highly specialized and requires manual skills that are not easily replicable through text-based or AI tools.

- E3: The task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images. Therefore, the image capabilities of the LLM are not relevant to this task.

2: E0

3: High certainty
