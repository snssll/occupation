1: In this task, a fundraiser is responsible for coordinating the transportation or delivery of materials, supplies, or donations for fundraising events. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality. 

Fundraisers typically require logistical coordination skills and communication abilities to ensure the smooth running of events. While the LLM can provide information on best practices for fundraising events, tips for effective communication, or sample templates for coordinating logistics, it cannot physically coordinate transportation or delivery. This task involves real-world logistics that require human interaction and physical coordination, which the LLM cannot directly assist with.
