1: In this task of repairing breaks in percussion instruments, the main actions involve using tools like drill presses, power saws, glue, clamps, grinding wheels, or other hand tools. These actions are physical and hands-on, requiring manual dexterity and knowledge of how to handle the tools properly to repair the instruments effectively.
