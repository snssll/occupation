1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of writing and sending letters of thanks to donors as a fundraiser, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves writing personalized letters expressing gratitude to donors, which can be time-consuming and require attention to detail. The LLM can assist in generating these letters by providing templates, suggestions for content, and even drafting entire letters based on input criteria such as donor information and donation amount. The LLM can also help with proofreading and ensuring the tone is appropriate for each donor.

Given that the task involves writing text and transforming it according to specific instructions, the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality. The LLM can generate multiple drafts quickly, allowing the fundraiser to choose the most suitable one. Additionally, the LLM can help maintain records of donor correspondence and ensure consistency in communication.

Considering these factors, the task of writing and sending letters of thanks to donors as a fundraiser falls under the E1 label, as direct access to the LLM can reduce the time it takes to complete the task by at least half.
