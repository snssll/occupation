1: In this task, the Morticians, Undertakers, and Funeral Arrangers are responsible for cleaning funeral home facilities and grounds. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone or with additional software could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task. 

- E0: This task involves physical cleaning of facilities and grounds, which cannot be automated by the LLM or any software tool. The task requires manual labor and does not involve text-based or image-based processing that the LLM can assist with.

- E1: The task does not involve writing, transforming text, summarizing documents, or any other text-based activities that the LLM can directly assist with. Therefore, direct access to the LLM would not reduce the time it takes to complete this task by at least half.

- E2: While it is conceivable that software could be developed to automate some aspects of facility and grounds cleaning, such as scheduling, inventory management, or task assignment, the core task of physical cleaning cannot be significantly expedited by the LLM alone. Thus, the task does not fit the E2 exposure label.

- E3: The task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images. Therefore, the LLM's text-based capabilities and potential image capabilities do not significantly impact the time it takes to clean funeral home facilities and grounds.
