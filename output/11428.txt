1: In this task, a Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Physician is required to perform electrodiagnosis, including electromyography, nerve conduction studies, or somatosensory evoked potentials of neuromuscular disorders or damage. This task involves specialized medical knowledge, technical skills, and hands-on patient interaction. The task requires physical presence, precise measurements, and real-time interpretation of results, which cannot be effectively replaced by an LLM or any software tool. The LLM does not have the capability to physically perform these diagnostic tests or interact with patients in a clinical setting. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not benefit from exposure to the LLM.

2: E0
