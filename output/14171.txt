1: In this task, a Gambling Manager is responsible for recording, collecting, or paying off bets and issuing receipts as necessary. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes for a worker to complete this task with high quality. The task involves basic record-keeping and transactional activities related to gambling operations. The LLM could potentially assist in generating standard receipts, providing templates for recording bets, or even offering suggestions for managing bets efficiently. However, the task also involves physical actions such as collecting cash or tokens, which cannot be directly performed by the LLM. Therefore, while the LLM can assist with some aspects of the task, it cannot fully automate it.
