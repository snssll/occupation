1: In this task, a radiologist is required to perform interventional procedures based on imaging guidance. The task involves a high level of expertise in interpreting medical images, understanding anatomy, and performing procedures accurately. While the task description does not explicitly mention the need for up-to-date information, it is crucial for a radiologist to stay updated on the latest techniques, equipment, and guidelines in interventional radiology.

Considering the task involves interpreting images and performing procedures based on them, having access to the LLM could potentially assist in providing additional information on specific procedures, guidelines, or recent advancements in the field. The LLM could help in summarizing complex medical literature, answering questions related to specific procedures, or providing insights into new techniques. However, the task also requires hands-on skills, precision, and real-time decision-making during procedures, which cannot be directly replaced by the LLM.
