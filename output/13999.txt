1: In this task, an Instructional Coordinator is responsible for recommending, ordering, or authorizing the purchase of instructional materials, supplies, equipment, and visual aids for educational purposes. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves a significant amount of text-based information related to educational materials, supplies, and equipment.
- The task requires understanding student educational needs and district standards, which can be captured within 2000 words.
- The task may involve researching and comparing different instructional materials and aids to make informed recommendations.

Given these considerations, the task can be effectively completed with the help of an LLM. The LLM can assist in researching, comparing, and generating recommendations based on the input provided. Therefore, this task falls under the E1 label as direct access to the LLM can reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality by at least half.
