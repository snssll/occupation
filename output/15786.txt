1: In this task, a Tool Grinder, Filer, and Sharpener is required to set up and operate grinding or polishing machines to grind metal workpieces. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be significantly aided by the use of the language model. The task involves technical skills related to operating machinery and performing precision work on metal pieces. While the LLM can provide general information on grinding or polishing techniques, it may not have the specific expertise required to operate the machines or handle the physical aspects of the job. The task does not involve text-based activities that the LLM could directly assist with, such as writing, summarizing, or providing feedback on documents. Therefore, the task does not align with the capabilities of the LLM, and it falls under E0.
