1: In this task, the Talent Directors are responsible for hiring and supervising workers who help locate individuals with specific attributes and talents. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. Talent Directors typically engage in activities that involve human interaction, decision-making, and management skills. While an LLM could potentially assist in drafting job descriptions, providing interview questions, or even suggesting talent sourcing strategies, the core aspects of hiring and supervising workers involve human judgment, interpersonal skills, and organizational knowledge that are not easily replicable by an LLM. Therefore, the task of hiring and supervising workers in this context is best classified as E0, as it does not significantly benefit from LLM capabilities.

2: E0
