1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of assembling solar modules, panels, or support structures as specified by Solar Photovoltaic Installers, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it.

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** If the task involves complex instructions, such as specific assembly guidelines or troubleshooting steps, the LLM could be used to provide detailed written guidance on how to assemble the solar components correctly. The LLM could generate text instructions, diagrams, or even videos to aid in the assembly process, potentially reducing the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality by at least half.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to provide real-time guidance, access to up-to-date installation techniques, or even virtual simulations of the assembly process. Such tools could enhance the efficiency and accuracy of the installation process, although they may not halve the time required to complete the task.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** If the task involves reading detailed diagrams, schematics, or technical drawings related to solar panel installation, having access to image capabilities could significantly reduce the time needed to interpret and follow these visual instructions. The LLM could assist in captioning images, providing additional context or explanations, and even generating simplified visual aids to aid in the assembly process.
