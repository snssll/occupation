1: In this task, a Computer Network Architect is responsible for maintaining networks by performing activities such as file addition, deletion, or backup. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task and how an LLM could assist in completing it. 

- E0: This task involves hands-on technical work related to computer networks, which may require physical access to network devices and systems. It also involves critical decision-making regarding network maintenance, which may not be suitable for automation by an LLM.
- E1: While an LLM could potentially assist in providing documentation or guidelines for network maintenance tasks, the actual execution of file addition, deletion, or backup would likely require direct interaction with network systems and devices, which is beyond the capabilities of an LLM.
- E2: Developing software on top of an LLM that could automate certain network maintenance tasks, such as file addition, deletion, or backup, could potentially reduce the time it takes to complete the task. This software could integrate with network management systems to automate routine maintenance activities.
- E3: Given the limitations of the LLM in interacting with physical systems and devices, as well as the need for technical expertise in network maintenance, the task does not align with the capabilities of image-related tools that could enhance the LLM's performance.
