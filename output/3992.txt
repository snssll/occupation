1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of creating or maintaining databases of known test defects as a Software Quality Assurance Analysts and Testers, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. In this task, the LLM can assist in writing and transforming text to organize and update the database of test defects. The model can help in summarizing information related to test defects, providing feedback on the database structure, and potentially generating questions or responses regarding the defects. However, since this task involves database management, which may require specific technical knowledge and skills beyond text-based information, the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task by at least half. While additional software could potentially be developed to enhance database management capabilities using LLM, such software would need to be highly specialized and tailored to the technical requirements of database maintenance in software testing.
