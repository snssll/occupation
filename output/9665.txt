1: In this task, a glazier is required to measure mirrors and dimensions of areas to be covered to determine work procedures. To complete this task, the glazier needs to accurately measure the mirrors and areas to ensure the correct size of glass is cut and installed. This task involves precise measurements and physical work that cannot be directly assisted by an LLM. While an LLM could potentially provide information on standard dimensions or techniques, it cannot physically measure the mirrors or areas. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not benefit from LLM assistance.

2: E0

3: High
