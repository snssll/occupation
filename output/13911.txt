1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of recommending diagnostic or therapeutic interventions as a Nurse Practitioner, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves analyzing various factors such as safety, cost, invasiveness, simplicity, acceptability, adherence, and efficacy to make recommendations. The LLM can provide general information and recommendations based on existing knowledge but lacks the ability to access real-time patient data or medical records. While the LLM can offer insights and suggestions based on the information provided in the task description, it cannot replace the expertise and experience of a healthcare professional when it comes to making specific medical recommendations for individual patients. Therefore, the task does not fall under E1 as it requires specialized domain knowledge beyond what the LLM can provide. Additionally, developing software on top of the LLM to handle such complex medical decision-making would be challenging and may not significantly reduce the time needed to complete the task. As a result, the task falls under E2 as it could potentially benefit from additional software that integrates specialized medical knowledge with the LLM's capabilities.
