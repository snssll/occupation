1: For the task of drawing and printing charts, graphs, illustrations, and other artwork using a computer as a Graphic Designer, the exposure to LLM can be evaluated as follows:

- E0: This task involves hands-on artistic skills and creativity that are not directly related to text-based tasks that an LLM can assist with. The task requires manual dexterity and artistic judgment, which are not within the capabilities of the LLM.

- E1: While the LLM can provide information on graphic design principles, techniques, and software tools, it cannot directly assist in the actual creation of visual artwork. The task of drawing and printing charts, graphs, illustrations, and other artwork is highly visual and requires artistic interpretation, which is beyond the capabilities of the LLM.

- E2: It is conceivable that additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to assist Graphic Designers in creating charts, graphs, and illustrations more efficiently. This software could potentially automate certain aspects of the design process or provide design suggestions based on input data. However, the task still heavily relies on the designer's creativity and artistic skills, which may not be fully replaceable by automated tools.

- E3: Given the limitations of the LLM in handling detailed visual tasks and the lack of image capabilities to accurately create or edit digital images, the task of drawing and printing charts, graphs, illustrations, and other artwork does not align with the capabilities of the LLM with image capabilities.
