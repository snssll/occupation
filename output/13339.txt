1: In this task, a Fitness and Wellness Coordinator is required to provide individual support or counseling in general wellness or nutrition. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality.

- E0: This task involves human interaction and personalized counseling, which may not be easily replaced by the LLM alone. The nuances of individual support and counseling in wellness or nutrition require empathy, understanding, and tailored advice that may not be effectively provided by the LLM alone.

- E1: While the LLM can provide general information on wellness and nutrition, it may not be able to offer the personalized, empathetic support required for individual counseling. The task involves a high degree of human interaction and emotional intelligence, which the LLM may not fully replicate.

- E2: It is conceivable that additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to assist Fitness and Wellness Coordinators in providing individual support or counseling. This software could potentially analyze data provided by the coordinator and offer tailored recommendations or insights based on the LLM's capabilities.

- E3: The task does not involve image capabilities, so this label does not apply.

Based on the considerations above, the task of providing individual support or counseling in general wellness or nutrition is best classified as E2.

2: E2

3: Moderate
