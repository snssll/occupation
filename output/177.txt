1: In this task, the Sawing Machine Setters, Operators, and Tenders, Wood need to adjust saw blades using various tools and methods. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if the task can be significantly expedited or improved by using the LLM. Since this task involves physical adjustments to machinery, it does not directly involve text input or output that the LLM can assist with. The LLM cannot physically interact with machinery or perform tasks that require physical adjustments. Therefore, the task does not fall under E1, E2, or E3 categories.
