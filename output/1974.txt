1: For the task of cleaning and reinstalling parts as a Home Appliance Repairer, the exposure to LLM can be evaluated as follows:

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** The task of cleaning and reinstalling parts does not involve complex instructions, writing or transforming text, summarizing documents, or any other text-based activities that the LLM could significantly assist with. This task is more hands-on and practical, requiring physical interaction with the appliance parts. Therefore, direct access to the LLM would not reduce the time it takes to complete this task by at least half.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While it is conceivable that software could be developed to provide guidance or instructions on how to clean and reinstall specific appliance parts, the current capabilities of the LLM alone do not offer a significant advantage in completing this task. The task is more about manual labor and technical skills rather than information processing or decision-making that the LLM excels at.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Image capabilities would not significantly impact the completion of this task. The task of cleaning and reinstalling parts does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images. The primary focus is on physical maintenance and repair work rather than visual or image-related tasks.

Based on the above analysis, the most appropriate label for this task would be **E0 (No exposure)**.

2: E0

3: Certainty level: High
