1: In this task, the Court, Municipal, and License Clerk is responsible for planning or directing the maintenance, filing, safekeeping, or computerization of all municipal documents. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- Direct exposure (E1): The task involves organizing and managing municipal documents, which could potentially benefit from the use of an LLM to assist in creating systems for filing, safekeeping, or computerization. The LLM could help in generating templates, organizing information, or suggesting efficient ways to manage documents.

- Exposure by LLM-powered applications (E2): While the task could potentially benefit from additional software developed on top of the LLM to streamline document management processes, the current description does not explicitly require highly specialized domain knowledge or complex databases. Therefore, the task may not see a significant reduction in time with just the LLM alone.

- Exposure given image capabilities (E3): This task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images, so the image capabilities of the LLM are not directly relevant here.

Considering the above points, the task of planning or directing the maintenance, filing, safekeeping, or computerization of all municipal documents is likely to fall under E2 - Exposure by LLM-powered applications.
