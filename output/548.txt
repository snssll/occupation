1: Mechatronics Engineers are responsible for integrating mechanical and electronic components to create automated systems. One of the tasks they perform is analyzing existing development or manufacturing procedures and suggesting improvements. To determine the exposure level of this task to LLM, we can break it down:

- Analyzing existing development or manufacturing procedures: This involves reviewing current processes, identifying inefficiencies, and understanding the workflow.
- Suggesting improvements: This requires creativity, problem-solving skills, and knowledge of best practices in mechatronics engineering.

Given that the task involves a combination of analyzing information and generating new ideas, an LLM could assist by providing insights into best practices, innovative solutions, or industry trends related to mechatronics engineering. The LLM could help in generating suggestions for improvements based on the data provided about the existing procedures.
