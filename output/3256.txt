1: In this task, a Medical Scientist is required to confer with various stakeholders to develop health safety standards and public health improvement programs. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be significantly expedited or improved by using the language model. 

- Direct exposure (E1): The task involves communication, collaboration, and decision-making based on expert knowledge in the field of public health. While the LLM can provide information and assist in generating written content, the core of this task involves human interaction, critical thinking, and domain expertise that cannot be fully replaced by the model. Therefore, direct access to the LLM may not reduce the time significantly for an experienced Medical Scientist to complete this task.

- Exposure by LLM-powered applications (E2): Although the LLM could potentially assist in drafting documents, summarizing information, or providing background research, the task primarily relies on human judgment, expertise, and collaboration with other professionals. While additional software could be developed to help organize information or provide recommendations, the fundamental nature of this task involves complex decision-making that goes beyond the capabilities of the LLM alone.

- Exposure given image capabilities (E3): The task does not involve image processing or analysis, so the image capabilities of the LLM are not relevant in this context.
