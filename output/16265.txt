1: In this task, a barista is responsible for stocking customer service stations with paper products or beverage preparation items. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone or with additional software could significantly reduce the time it takes for a barista to complete this task.

- E0: This task involves physical actions such as stocking items, which cannot be directly assisted by the LLM or any software tool. The task also does not involve complex decision-making or specialized knowledge that would benefit from LLM capabilities.

- E1: While the LLM could potentially provide written instructions or checklists for stocking items, the physical aspect of the task cannot be directly assisted by the LLM. The task does not involve complex transformations of text or code that would significantly benefit from the LLM's capabilities.

- E2: It is challenging to imagine additional software built on top of the LLM that could reduce the time it takes to physically stock customer service stations with items. The task is straightforward and does not require specialized domain knowledge or complex decision-making that would benefit from advanced LLM capabilities.

- E3: The task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images, so the image capabilities of the LLM are not relevant to this task.
