1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of providing preliminary sketches or cost estimates for materials or services as an Electrician, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be completed with the help of an LLM.

- Electricians typically need to assess the requirements of a project, including materials and labor costs, to provide accurate estimates. This task involves a combination of technical knowledge, experience, and understanding of project specifications.
- While an LLM can assist in generating text-based content, it may not have the specialized knowledge required to accurately estimate material costs or provide technical sketches in the context of electrical work.
- The task involves a level of domain-specific expertise that may not be effectively captured by the LLM alone, as it requires understanding of electrical systems, building codes, and project scope.
- While the LLM could potentially assist in drafting text-based descriptions or explanations related to cost estimates, the task of providing accurate preliminary sketches or detailed material cost estimates may not be significantly expedited by the LLM alone.
