1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of planning and conducting activities for a balanced program of instruction for students, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The task involves planning and conducting activities for students, which can benefit from the LLM's ability to generate instructional materials, provide ideas for activities, and help in structuring lesson plans. The LLM can assist in creating engaging content for students to observe, question, and investigate, thereby reducing the time it takes to plan such activities.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task, additional software built on top of the LLM could enhance the process. This software could provide personalized activity suggestions based on student needs, offer insights into effective instructional strategies, or even generate interactive learning materials.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities would not significantly impact the task of planning and conducting activities for students. This task primarily involves text-based planning and instructional design, which does not heavily rely on image processing.
