1: In this task, a Heavy and Tractor-Trailer Truck Driver needs to read bills of lading to determine assignment details. This task involves reading and interpreting text, specifically bills of lading, which contain information about the cargo being transported, the destination, and other relevant details. With the help of a large language model (LLM), the driver could potentially have the text from the bills of lading summarized or analyzed for key assignment details. The LLM could assist in extracting and highlighting important information, reducing the time needed to manually read and interpret each document.

Considering the nature of the task and the potential for the LLM to assist in summarizing or extracting key details from the bills of lading, this task could be classified as E1. The LLM could significantly reduce the time required to extract assignment details from the documents, improving efficiency and accuracy.
