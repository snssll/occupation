1: In this task, the occupation of Animal Breeders involves the responsibility of exercising animals to maintain their health. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be impacted by the capabilities of the LLM. 

- E0: This task involves physical activity and direct interaction with animals, which cannot be replaced by text-based tools like the LLM. The task requires hands-on work that cannot be automated or assisted by the LLM.

- E1: The task of exercising animals involves physical activity and direct engagement, which cannot be effectively replaced by text-based interactions with the LLM. The LLM cannot perform physical tasks or interact with animals in a way that would be necessary for this job.

- E2: While the LLM could potentially provide information on animal exercise routines or health tips, the core task of physically exercising animals cannot be significantly aided by the LLM alone. However, additional software that could be developed on top of the LLM, such as a virtual reality simulation for animal exercise guidance, could potentially reduce the time it takes to complete the task.

- E3: The task of exercising animals does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images. Therefore, the image capabilities of the LLM would not significantly impact the completion of this task.
