1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of obtaining, updating, or maintaining plans, permits, or standard operating procedures as an Environmental Engineer, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves working with text-based documents and ensuring they are accurate and up-to-date. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM can assist in writing and transforming text, providing edits to existing documents, and maintaining records of written data. In this case, the LLM could help in updating and maintaining plans, permits, or standard operating procedures by generating text or making edits based on provided information.
- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not reduce the time to complete the task by half, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to summarize longer documents, retrieve up-to-date information, or search through existing knowledge bases to assist in obtaining necessary documents.
- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Since the task primarily involves text-based documents and does not require detailed image analysis, image capabilities would not significantly impact the completion of this task.

Considering the above points, the task of obtaining, updating, or maintaining plans, permits, or standard operating procedures as an Environmental Engineer could be best classified as E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications.
