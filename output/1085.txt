1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of assembling prototypes of new environmental technologies for aircraft as an Aircraft Structure, Surfaces, Rigging, and Systems Assembler, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be impacted by the use of a large language model (LLM).

- E0: This task involves physical assembly work that requires hands-on skills and expertise in aircraft technology. The task does not involve text-based activities that can be significantly enhanced by the use of an LLM.

- E1: While the LLM could potentially assist in providing information or guidance on assembling certain components, the core aspect of physically assembling prototypes of new technologies for aircraft is not something that can be directly replaced or significantly expedited by the LLM. The task involves practical skills and hands-on work that cannot be fully automated by text-based tools.

- E2: It is conceivable that an application could be developed on top of the LLM that could provide recommendations or insights into the assembly process based on the latest environmental technology advancements in the aerospace industry. This application could potentially streamline the information gathering process or offer suggestions for improvements in the assembly process, but it would not fundamentally change the hands-on nature of the task.

- E3: The task does not involve image processing or detailed visual instructions that would benefit significantly from image capabilities in conjunction with the LLM. The assembly of aircraft prototypes relies more on technical knowledge and physical skills rather than image-based instructions.
