1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of recording production and test data for each food product batch as a Food Batchmaker, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves documenting specific details related to food production, which can be time-consuming and require attention to detail. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM can assist in writing and organizing the data for each food product batch. It can help in structuring the information, ensuring accuracy, and maintaining records efficiently. The LLM can also generate templates for recording data, making the process more streamlined and error-free.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task, additional software could be developed to automate data entry, integrate with production equipment to capture real-time data, and provide insights or recommendations based on the recorded information. Such software could enhance the efficiency of data recording and analysis for Food Batchmakers.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities would not significantly impact the task of recording production and test data for food product batches, as it primarily involves text-based information rather than visual data.
