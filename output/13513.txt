1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of providing technical support for existing reports, dashboards, or other tools as a Business Intelligence Analyst, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be supported by the capabilities of the LLM.

- Business Intelligence Analysts often deal with data analysis, reporting, and visualization tools to support decision-making within organizations.
- Providing technical support for existing reports, dashboards, or tools may involve troubleshooting, making enhancements, or ensuring the accuracy and functionality of these tools.
- The task does not inherently require specialized domain knowledge beyond general business intelligence concepts and technical skills related to data analysis and visualization tools.

Given these considerations, the task of providing technical support for existing reports, dashboards, or tools can benefit from the LLM's capabilities in understanding complex instructions, providing edits or recommendations, and potentially even generating solutions based on the context provided. While the task may not be fully automated by the LLM, it can significantly reduce the time needed for tasks such as troubleshooting or suggesting improvements.
