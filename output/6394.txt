1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of evaluating data pertaining to costs to plan budgets for Financial Managers, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves analyzing financial data, which can be complex and require expertise in financial management. The LLM can assist in processing and analyzing textual information related to financial data, providing insights, and potentially generating reports based on the input data. However, the task may also involve accessing and interpreting real-time financial data, which the LLM may not be able to do without up-to-date information. 

Given that the task involves analyzing data and planning budgets, the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task by providing insights, generating reports, and assisting in data analysis. However, the LLM may not be able to access up-to-date financial information without it being provided in the input. Therefore, the task falls under E2 - Exposure by LLM-powered applications, as additional software could be developed to integrate real-time financial data retrieval capabilities with the LLM to further enhance its assistance in financial analysis tasks.
