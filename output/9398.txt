1: In this task, a school bus driver is required to make minor repairs to vehicles. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone or with additional software could significantly reduce the time it takes for a school bus driver to complete the task of making minor repairs to vehicles.

- E0: This task involves physical repairs to vehicles, which cannot be performed by the LLM or any software tool. The task requires hands-on work and precise mechanical skills, which are beyond the capabilities of text-based AI models.

- E1: The LLM could potentially provide written instructions or guidance on how to make minor repairs to vehicles. However, since the task involves physical actions like repairing parts of a vehicle, the LLM alone cannot reduce the time it takes to complete the task by at least half.

- E2: While it's conceivable that specialized software could be developed to provide step-by-step repair instructions tailored to specific vehicle models, this would require a level of integration with real-time diagnostics and physical tools that go beyond the capabilities of the LLM alone.

- E3: The task of making minor repairs to vehicles does not involve image processing or detailed visual instructions that would benefit from image capabilities. Therefore, access to image capabilities would not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task.

2: E0
