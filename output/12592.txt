1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of preparing meals in private households as a Cook in terms of exposure to LLM, we need to consider the nature of the task. This task involves following recipes or tastes provided by the employer, handling meals for the family, and potentially for other household staff. The task primarily involves cooking and food preparation, which are practical, hands-on activities that require physical presence and interaction with ingredients, cooking equipment, and the kitchen environment. While an LLM could potentially provide recipe suggestions or cooking tips, the actual cooking process itself cannot be automated by the LLM. Additionally, the task involves personal preferences and tastes of the employer, which may require nuanced understanding and adaptation that goes beyond text-based instructions. Therefore, the task of preparing meals in private households as a Cook is best classified as E0 - No exposure to LLM.
