1: In this task, the Tax Examiner needs to maintain knowledge of tax code changes and accounting procedures to evaluate financial information accurately. With access to the most powerful OpenAI large language model (LLM), the Tax Examiner could easily stay up-to-date with the latest tax code changes and accounting procedures by reading and summarizing relevant documents, generating questions for further research, and even receiving recommendations based on the information provided. The LLM could assist in summarizing complex tax laws and accounting theories, making it easier for the Tax Examiner to digest and apply this information effectively.

Considering the nature of the task and the capabilities of the LLM, it falls under E1. The LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes for the Tax Examiner to stay informed about tax code changes and accounting procedures, thereby enhancing their ability to evaluate financial information accurately.
