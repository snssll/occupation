1: For the task of copying parts from scores for individual performers as a Music Director or Composer, the most relevant exposure label from the rubric would be E0. This task involves manual work of transcribing musical scores onto individual parts for performers, which does not directly align with the capabilities of the LLM. The task does not involve complex decision-making, specialized domain knowledge retrieval, or image processing that would benefit significantly from LLM capabilities. Therefore, the task does not fall under E1, E2, or E3 exposure categories.

2: E0

3: High
