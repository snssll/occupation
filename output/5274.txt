1: In this task, a Chief Sustainability Officer is responsible for developing or overseeing the development of marketing or outreach media for sustainability projects or events. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- E0: This task involves creativity, strategic thinking, and understanding of sustainability principles. While an LLM can assist in generating text content for marketing materials, it may not have the domain-specific knowledge required to effectively develop sustainability-focused media.

- E1: The LLM can assist in generating text content for marketing materials related to sustainability projects or events. It can help in drafting compelling messages, slogans, or descriptions. However, the task also requires a deep understanding of sustainability concepts, target audience preferences, and effective marketing strategies, which the LLM may not possess.

- E2: While the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time to complete the task, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to provide recommendations on sustainability-focused marketing strategies based on data analysis, audience insights, and current trends. This software could enhance the efficiency of developing marketing media for sustainability projects.

- E3: Image capabilities are not directly relevant to this task, as it primarily involves developing text-based marketing or outreach media.
