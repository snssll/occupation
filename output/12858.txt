1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of preparing written opinions and decisions as an Administrative Law Judge, Adjudicator, or Hearing Officer, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM in assisting with this task. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM can assist in writing and transforming text according to complex instructions. It can help in providing edits to existing text or code following specifications. In this case, the task involves preparing written opinions and decisions, which aligns with the LLM's ability to generate written content based on input and instructions. The LLM can help in drafting, structuring, and refining the written content for opinions and decisions.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task of preparing written opinions and decisions, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to further enhance the process. This software could potentially summarize lengthy legal documents, provide recommendations based on legal precedents, or analyze complex legal cases to support the decision-making process.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not directly relevant to the task of preparing written opinions and decisions for Administrative Law Judges, Adjudicators, and Hearing Officers. This task primarily involves text-based work and legal analysis, which can be effectively supported by the LLM's text generation and comprehension abilities.
