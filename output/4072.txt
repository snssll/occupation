1: In this task, a Museum Technician and Conservator is required to cut and weld metal sections in the reconstruction or renovation of exterior structural sections and accessories of exhibits. This task involves physical work that cannot be directly performed by an LLM. The LLM does not have the capability to physically cut and weld metal sections. While the LLM could potentially provide information on metalworking techniques or safety guidelines, it cannot replace the physical aspect of the task. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not involve text-based work that can be significantly aided by the LLM.
