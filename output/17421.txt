1: In this task, a cleaner of vehicles and equipment is required to turn valves or disconnect hoses to eliminate water, cleaning solutions, or vapors from machinery or tanks. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. This task involves physical actions such as turning valves and disconnecting hoses, which cannot be directly performed by an LLM. The task does not involve complex decision-making, specialized knowledge, or detailed documentation that would benefit significantly from LLM capabilities. Therefore, this task does not align with any of the exposure levels in the rubric.

2: E0
