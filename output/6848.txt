1: In this task, a firefighter is required to extinguish flames and embers to suppress fires using shovels or water pumps. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone or with additional software could significantly reduce the time it takes for a firefighter to complete this task with high quality.

- E0: This task involves physical actions such as using shovels and water pumps, which cannot be replaced by text-based tools like the LLM. Additionally, the task requires immediate and hands-on intervention, making it unsuitable for automation or assistance from the LLM.

- E1: The task of extinguishing fires is highly practical and requires physical presence and action. While the LLM can provide information on firefighting techniques or safety protocols, it cannot directly assist in the physical act of suppressing fires. Therefore, the task does not align with the capabilities of the LLM for significant time reduction.

- E2: While the LLM could potentially provide theoretical knowledge or safety guidelines related to firefighting, the practical aspect of extinguishing flames and embers in real-time cannot be automated or significantly assisted by the LLM alone. Developing additional software on top of the LLM that could aid in firefighting tasks is not feasible due to the hands-on nature of the work.

- E3: The task of extinguishing fires does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images. Therefore, the use of image capabilities alongside the LLM would not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task.
