1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of explaining police operations to subordinates, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The task involves explaining complex information related to police operations to subordinates. The LLM can help in generating clear and detailed explanations based on the input provided. It can assist in breaking down the information into easily understandable segments and providing relevant examples to aid in comprehension. The LLM can also help in structuring the explanation in a logical manner, ensuring that all key points are covered.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM can provide valuable assistance in generating explanations, there may be additional software that could be developed on top of the LLM to further enhance the process. For example, a specialized application could be created that integrates real-time data on police operations to provide up-to-date information for the explanations. This application could also analyze the effectiveness of the explanations provided by the LLM and suggest improvements based on feedback.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - The task of explaining police operations may not directly benefit from image capabilities, as it primarily involves verbal communication of information. However, if there were visual aids or diagrams related to police operations that needed to be created or edited, the image capabilities could be useful in enhancing the explanation process.
