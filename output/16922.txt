1: In this task of testing electrical systems of rail cars, the Rail Car Repairers need to operate systems and use testing equipment like ammeters. To complete this task, they would need to physically interact with the rail cars, operate the systems, and use the testing equipment. This task involves hands-on work that cannot be directly replaced by an LLM. The LLM does not have the capability to physically interact with the rail cars or operate testing equipment. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not involve text-based work that can be significantly aided by the LLM.

2: E0
