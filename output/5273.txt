1: In this task, a Zoologist or Wildlife Biologist is required to develop management systems and plans for wildlife populations and habitats, consulting with stakeholders and the public to explore options. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves analyzing data, understanding ecological systems, and engaging with stakeholders. While an LLM can provide information on wildlife populations and habitats, it may not have the specialized domain knowledge required to develop comprehensive management systems and plans. The task also involves consulting with stakeholders and the public, which requires human interaction and decision-making skills. Therefore, the task falls under E0 as it involves a high degree of human interaction, specialized domain knowledge, and decision-making that cannot be fully automated by an LLM.
