1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of planning menus as a Cook in an institution or cafeteria, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves creating varied, nutritionally balanced, and appetizing menus by taking advantage of seasonal foods and local availability. The LLM can assist in providing general information on nutrition, seasonal foods, and local availability based on existing knowledge within its training data. It can also generate menu ideas and suggest combinations of dishes. However, the task requires practical knowledge of food preparation, cooking techniques, and taste combinations, which the LLM may not possess. While the LLM can provide some assistance in generating menu ideas, the actual planning and execution of menus may still heavily rely on human expertise in the culinary field.
