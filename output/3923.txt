1: In this task, the main activities involve creating and updating a database of completed appraisals. The task does not require direct interaction with clients or physical property inspection, making it suitable for automation. An LLM could be used to generate appraisal reports based on input data, update the database with new appraisals, and potentially even analyze trends in the data. However, the task does not involve complex decision-making or specialized domain knowledge beyond what the LLM can provide. Therefore, while the LLM can assist in creating and updating the database, it may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task by half.
