1: In this task, the Parking Attendant is responsible for performing personnel activities such as supervising or scheduling employees. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone or with additional software could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task. 

- E0: This task involves human interaction and decision-making that may not be easily automated by the LLM alone. It requires understanding the nuances of personnel management, which may not be effectively handled by the LLM.
- E1: While the LLM could potentially assist in generating written materials related to personnel activities, such as scheduling emails or drafting documents, the core aspects of supervising and scheduling employees involve human judgment and interaction that the LLM may not be able to replicate effectively.
- E2: It is conceivable that additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to help with certain aspects of personnel activities, such as generating employee schedules based on data inputs. However, the complexity of supervising employees and making personnel decisions may still require significant human input.
- E3: The task does not involve image capabilities, so this label does not apply.

Based on the analysis, the most appropriate label for this task is E2.

2: E2

3: Moderate
