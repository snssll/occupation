1: In this task, a dental hygienist is required to feel the lymph nodes under a patient's chin to detect any swelling or tenderness that could indicate the presence of oral cancer. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves physical interaction with a patient, which cannot be replaced by text-based interactions with an LLM.
- It requires tactile skills and the ability to detect subtle changes in the lymph nodes, which cannot be replicated by an LLM.
- The task involves a high degree of human interaction and physical examination, making it unsuitable for automation through text-based tools like an LLM.

Based on these considerations, the task falls under E0 as it cannot be significantly expedited or improved in quality by using an LLM.
