1: In this task, an Automotive Body and Related Repairer is required to apply heat to plastic panels and reshape them by hand. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone or with additional software could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality.

- E0: This task involves physical manipulation of materials (reshaping plastic panels by hand) and requires hands-on skills that cannot be replaced by text-based tools like the LLM. Additionally, the task involves precise manual work that cannot be effectively performed by a language model.

- E1: The task does not involve writing, transforming text, or providing edits to existing text. It is a hands-on task that requires physical skills and manual labor. The LLM cannot directly assist in applying heat to plastic panels or reshaping them by hand.

- E2: While it is conceivable that specialized software could be developed to assist in automotive repair tasks, such as providing guidance on repair techniques or suggesting solutions based on input data, the current capabilities of the LLM alone do not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this physical repair task.

- E3: The task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images. The use of image capabilities would not significantly impact the completion of this hands-on repair task.
