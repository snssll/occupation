1: In this task, a Web Administrator is required to identify or address interoperability requirements, which involves ensuring that different systems, software, and devices can communicate and work together effectively. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM can assist in completing it. 

- E0: This task does not involve direct text input or output that can be easily handled by the LLM. It requires a deep understanding of technical systems and their interactions, which may not be effectively addressed by the LLM alone.

- E1: While the LLM can provide general information on interoperability requirements, the task of identifying and addressing specific requirements may require specialized technical knowledge and expertise that the LLM may not possess. The LLM can assist in providing some background information or general guidance, but the task itself is more complex and may not be significantly expedited by the LLM alone.

- E2: It is conceivable that additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to help with this task. For example, a specialized tool that can analyze different systems and software requirements and provide recommendations based on the input provided. This tool could potentially reduce the time it takes to identify and address interoperability requirements by leveraging the capabilities of the LLM.

- E3: The task does not involve image capabilities, so this label does not apply.

Based on the analysis above, the most appropriate exposure label for this task is E2.

2: E2

3: Moderate
