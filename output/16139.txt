1: In this task, a Laundry and Dry-Cleaning Worker is responsible for spreading soiled articles on work tables and positioning stained portions over vacuum heads or on marble slabs. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if access to the LLM or LLM-powered tools can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality.

- The task involves physical actions such as spreading articles and positioning stained portions, which cannot be directly assisted by the LLM.
- The task does not involve complex decision-making, analysis of data, writing, summarizing, or any other cognitive tasks that the LLM could assist with.
- There is no need for language translation, document summarization, or information retrieval beyond the task description itself.
- The task does not involve any image-related capabilities that the LLM could assist with.

Based on these considerations, it is clear that the task of spreading soiled articles on work tables and positioning stained portions does not align with any of the exposure levels in the rubric. The task is purely physical and does not involve cognitive or information-related aspects that could benefit from LLM assistance.
