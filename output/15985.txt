1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of "Sing or dance during dramatic or comedic performances" for the occupation of Actors, we need to consider the capabilities of the OpenAI large language model (LLM). The task involves physical actions such as singing and dancing, which cannot be directly performed by the LLM. The LLM can provide text-based guidance, scripts, or descriptions related to singing or dancing, but it cannot physically execute these actions. Therefore, the task does not align with the capabilities of the LLM in its current form. As a result, this task falls under E0 as it does not significantly benefit from the use of the LLM.

2: E0
