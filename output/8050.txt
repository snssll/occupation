1: In this task, a Glass Blower, Molder, Bender, or Finisher is required to inspect, weigh, and measure products to ensure they meet specifications. This task involves precise measurements and visual inspection, which cannot be effectively performed by an LLM. The LLM does not have the capability to physically interact with objects or take precise measurements. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not benefit from the capabilities of the LLM.
