1: In this task for Automotive Glass Installers and Repairers, the main steps involve removing dirt, foreign matter, and loose glass from damaged areas, applying primer along windshield or window edges, and allowing the primer to dry. These steps are primarily manual and require physical dexterity and precision. The task does not involve text input or output, complex instructions, or data analysis that could be significantly aided by an LLM. Additionally, the task involves working with physical materials and surfaces, which cannot be directly assisted by an LLM. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM or any tools built on top of it.
