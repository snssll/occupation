1: In this task, the Physical Therapist Aides are responsible for training patients to use orthopedic braces, prostheses, or supportive devices. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality. Since this task involves hands-on training and physical interaction with patients, it cannot be effectively completed using the LLM alone. The LLM does not have the capability to physically train patients or demonstrate the proper use of orthopedic devices. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not benefit from the capabilities of the LLM.

2: E0
