1: For the task of examining objects to be included in exhibits to plan where and how to display them, the most relevant exposure label from the rubric is E0. This task involves physical interaction with objects, visual assessment of the objects, and spatial planning for their display. While an LLM could potentially assist in generating text-based descriptions or suggestions for exhibit layouts, the core aspects of physically examining objects and spatial planning cannot be effectively performed by the LLM alone. Therefore, the task does not align with the capabilities of the LLM or any tools built on top of it.
