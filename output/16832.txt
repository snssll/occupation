1: For the task of teaching social skills to students as a short-term substitute teacher, the exposure to LLM can be analyzed as follows:

- E0: This task involves direct human interaction and requires real-time observation and feedback, which cannot be effectively replaced by LLM or any tool built on top of it. The nuanced and dynamic nature of teaching social skills to students makes it unsuitable for automation through LLM.

- E1: LLM could potentially provide resources, lesson plans, or guidance on teaching social skills. It could also assist in generating ideas for activities or scenarios to help students practice these skills. However, the core aspect of teaching social skills, which involves real-time interaction, modeling, and feedback, cannot be fully automated by LLM.

- E2: While LLM could potentially assist in creating educational materials or providing background information on social skills, the task of teaching social skills is highly interactive and context-dependent. It requires personalized feedback, observation, and adaptation to individual student needs, which are beyond the capabilities of current LLM-powered applications.

- E3: LLM, even with image capabilities, cannot effectively replace the interactive and dynamic nature of teaching social skills to students. This task heavily relies on human interaction, observation, and feedback, which cannot be adequately replicated through text or image-based tools.

Based on the analysis above, the task of teaching social skills to students as a short-term substitute teacher is best classified as E0.
