1: In this task, the Farm and Home Management Educators are required to advise farmers on various aspects such as livestock health maintenance, growing practices, and financial planning. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. Providing advice and demonstrating techniques to farmers involves a significant amount of domain-specific knowledge and expertise. While an LLM could potentially assist in generating general information on these topics, the task also requires practical, hands-on demonstrations and personalized advice tailored to individual farmers' needs. The task involves interacting with farmers, understanding their specific circumstances, and providing customized guidance, which goes beyond the capabilities of the LLM. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it involves a high degree of human interaction, personalized advice, and practical demonstrations that cannot be effectively replaced by an LLM.
