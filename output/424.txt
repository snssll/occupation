1: In this task, the Occupational Therapy Assistants aid patients in dressing and grooming themselves. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes for an average worker to complete this task with equivalent quality. The task involves physical interaction with patients, which cannot be replaced by text-based instructions or responses from the LLM. The LLM cannot physically assist patients in dressing and grooming, so it cannot directly impact the completion time of this task. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not meet the criteria for exposure to LLM.
