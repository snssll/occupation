1: In this task, the Appraisers of Personal and Business Property need to update their appraisals based on changes to the property, such as improvements, damages, or other alterations. To complete this task, the appraiser would typically need to assess the current condition of the property, gather relevant information, and adjust the appraisal value accordingly. With access to the powerful OpenAI large language model (LLM), the appraiser could potentially streamline the process by quickly researching any changes in property values, regulations, or market trends that may impact the appraisal. The LLM could assist in providing up-to-date information on property values, construction costs, market trends, and other relevant data that could influence the updated appraisal. By leveraging the LLM's capabilities, the appraiser could potentially save time in researching and analyzing the necessary information to update the appraisals accurately.
