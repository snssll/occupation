1: In this task, a Fishing and Hunting Worker is required to scrape fat, blubber, or flesh from the skin sides of pelts using knives or hand scrapers. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. This task involves manual labor and physical dexterity, as it requires the worker to use knives or hand scrapers to remove unwanted material from pelts. The task does not involve complex text input or output, and the context is primarily focused on physical actions rather than written instructions or information processing. As such, the task does not align with the capabilities of the LLM, which is designed for text-based tasks and does not have the ability to perform physical actions.
