1: In this task, the occupation of roofers involves installing solar roofing systems with energy-collecting photovoltaic panels. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone or additional software could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task. 

Given the nature of the task, which involves physical installation work and specialized knowledge of roofing and solar systems, it is unlikely that access to the LLM alone would reduce the time it takes to complete the task. The task requires hands-on work, precise measurements, and technical expertise that cannot be substituted by text-based information or AI capabilities. While the LLM could potentially provide some general information about solar roofing systems, it cannot replace the practical skills and physical labor needed for installation.
