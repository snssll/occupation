1: In this task, the Nursing Instructors and Teachers, Postsecondary are required to evaluate and grade students' class work, laboratory and clinic work, assignments, and papers. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM could assist in providing feedback on assignments and papers, generating grading rubrics, and even suggesting improvements in student work based on common errors. It could also help in summarizing key points in lengthy papers for quicker evaluation.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - Additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to analyze student work for plagiarism, provide insights into grading trends, and even offer personalized feedback based on individual student needs.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Since this task primarily involves evaluating written work, there is no significant benefit from image capabilities in this context.
