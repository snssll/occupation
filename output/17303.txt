1: In this task of transporting, assembling, and disassembling materials used in presentations, the main activities involve physical actions such as moving items, setting up equipment, and taking down displays. These actions require physical dexterity and coordination, which cannot be directly assisted by an LLM. While the LLM could potentially provide guidance on how to organize materials or suggest efficient ways to set up a presentation, the core task of physically handling materials is not something the LLM can directly assist with. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not involve text-based activities that the LLM can significantly impact.
