1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of researching, documenting, rating, or selecting alternatives for Web architecture or technologies as a Web and Digital Interface Designer/Web Developer, we need to consider the nature of the task and the capabilities of the LLM.

- The task involves researching and documenting information related to web architecture and technologies. The LLM can assist in gathering information, summarizing documents, providing feedback on documents, and answering questions about documents. It can also help in generating questions related to the topic.

- While the LLM can provide valuable insights and information, it may not significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete the task, as the task requires specialized domain knowledge and expertise in web development.

- Additionally, the task may involve evaluating and rating alternatives, which may require a deeper understanding of technical details and practical implications that the LLM alone may not be able to provide.
