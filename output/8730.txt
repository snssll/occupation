1: In this task, the occupation involves laying and aligning bricks, blocks, or tiles to build or repair structures or high-temperature equipment. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if the task can be significantly aided by the use of the LLM. The task of laying and aligning bricks requires physical labor, precision, and hands-on skills. While the LLM can provide information on techniques, materials, or safety guidelines related to bricklaying, it cannot physically perform the task itself. The task does not involve text input or output, and the context is more practical and physical in nature, making it unsuitable for direct exposure to the LLM.
