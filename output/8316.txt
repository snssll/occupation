1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of instructing undergraduate and graduate students within the areas of cellular or molecular biology as a Molecular and Cellular Biologist, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be impacted by the use of the LLM. In this case, the task involves providing educational instruction, which requires a deep understanding of the subject matter, effective communication skills, and the ability to tailor explanations to the level of the students. While the LLM can provide information and explanations related to cellular and molecular biology, it may not have the expertise or interactive capabilities to effectively instruct students in a classroom setting. The task involves human interaction, personalized feedback, and the ability to adapt teaching methods based on student responses, which are aspects that the LLM may not be able to fully replicate.
