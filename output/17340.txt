1: In this task, a skincare specialist is required to treat facial skin to maintain and improve its appearance using specialized techniques and products. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves hands-on physical interaction with a client's skin, which cannot be performed by an LLM or any software tool. The specialized techniques and products used by skincare specialists require physical application and assessment, which cannot be replicated by text-based instructions alone. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it involves a high degree of human interaction and physical application.
