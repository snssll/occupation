1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of developing and implementing procedures for identifying advertising needs as a Market Research Analyst or Marketing Specialist, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it.

- E1: Direct exposure - The task involves analyzing and strategizing advertising needs, which could benefit from the LLM's ability to provide insights, generate ideas, and assist in developing procedures through text input and output. The LLM can help in brainstorming, refining strategies, and providing detailed recommendations based on the input data.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time to complete this task, additional software built on top of the LLM could enhance the process. For example, specialized tools could be developed to analyze market trends, consumer behavior, and competitor strategies to provide more targeted recommendations for advertising needs.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not directly relevant to this task as it primarily involves text-based analysis and strategy development. Therefore, this task does not fall under E3.
