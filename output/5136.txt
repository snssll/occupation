1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of developing product packaging, display, and pricing strategies for Craft Artists, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM can assist in completing it. 

- Craft Artists typically require creativity and an understanding of market trends to develop effective product packaging, display, and pricing strategies. The LLM can provide information on current market trends, consumer preferences, and pricing strategies based on existing data and knowledge. It can also generate ideas for packaging designs and display arrangements.

- The LLM can assist in researching and summarizing information related to product packaging, display, and pricing strategies, which can save time for the Craft Artists in gathering relevant data.

- However, the task of developing these strategies also involves a significant level of creativity and domain-specific knowledge, which may not be fully captured by the LLM alone. Craft Artists may need to rely on their expertise and artistic skills to come up with unique and appealing packaging and display concepts.
