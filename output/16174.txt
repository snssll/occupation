1: In this task, a gambling dealer is responsible for starting and controlling games, as well as announcing winning numbers or colors. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves primarily verbal communication and basic game operations, which can be easily described and understood by the LLM. The model can generate text instructions on how to start and control games, as well as announce winning outcomes. Since the task does not involve complex decision-making, specialized domain knowledge, or detailed visual analysis, the LLM can effectively assist in providing guidance on how to perform these tasks.

Considering the task's reliance on text-based instructions and communication, the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality. Therefore, this task falls under the E1 label as direct access to the LLM can streamline the process of providing instructions and information related to starting and controlling games in a gambling setting.
