1: Hazardous Materials Removal Workers are responsible for removing hazardous materials such as asbestos or lead from various surfaces using tools like scrapers, vacuums, or high-pressure sprayers. This task involves physical labor and requires specialized training to ensure safety and compliance with regulations. Since the task involves hands-on work with tools, it does not directly involve text-based inputs or outputs that could benefit significantly from the capabilities of an LLM. Additionally, the task requires expertise in handling hazardous materials safely, which cannot be replaced by text-based AI models. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM or any tools built on top of it.
