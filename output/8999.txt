1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of maintaining a lost-and-found collection as a Locker Room, Coatroom, and Dressing Room Attendant, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be impacted by the use of a large language model (LLM).

- E0: This task involves physical organization and management of lost items in a physical space, which cannot be directly assisted by an LLM. The task does not involve text input or output that can be significantly enhanced by the LLM.

- E1: While an LLM could potentially assist in creating documentation or records related to the lost-and-found items, the core task of physically managing and organizing the items in a physical space cannot be directly impacted by the LLM. The time saved by using an LLM for this task would not be significant enough to warrant an E1 label.

- E2: It is conceivable that an application could be developed on top of the LLM to help generate standardized documentation for lost-and-found items or to assist in tracking and categorizing items. However, the physical aspect of maintaining the lost-and-found collection would still require manual effort, and the time saved by using such an application may not be substantial.

- E3: The task of maintaining a lost-and-found collection does not involve image processing or analysis that would benefit from additional image capabilities alongside the LLM. Therefore, an E3 label is not applicable.
