1: In this task, the occupation involves tank car, truck, and ship loaders who are responsible for removing and replacing tank car dome caps or directing other workers in doing so. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be significantly aided by the use of the language model. Since the task involves a physical action of removing and replacing dome caps, it does not directly involve text-based instructions, complex data analysis, or decision-making that could be easily automated by an LLM. The task is more hands-on and requires physical presence and action, which cannot be substituted by text-based instructions alone. Therefore, the task does not align with the capabilities of the LLM in a way that would significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task.
