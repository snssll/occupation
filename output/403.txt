1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of advising students on academic and vocational curricula and career issues as a postsecondary teacher, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM can assist in completing it. 

- E1: If the task involves providing personalized advice to students based on their individual needs and circumstances, the LLM can help generate tailored responses and recommendations. The LLM can assist in crafting responses to common questions about academic curricula, vocational paths, and career issues, thereby reducing the time it takes to provide guidance to students effectively.

- E2: If the task requires accessing up-to-date information on academic programs, vocational trends, and career opportunities, the LLM alone may not be sufficient. However, additional software could be developed to integrate the LLM's capabilities with real-time data sources to provide the most current advice to students.

- E3: If the task involves creating visual aids or presentations to supplement the advice given to students, the LLM's text capabilities combined with image capabilities could significantly enhance the effectiveness of the guidance provided. This could include creating infographics, slideshows, or other visual materials to support the academic and career advice given.
