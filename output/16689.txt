1: In this task, a Refuse and Recyclable Material Collector is responsible for tagging garbage or recycling containers to inform customers of issues such as excess garbage or items that are not allowed. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves primarily written communication (tagging containers with information), which can be easily handled by an LLM through text input and output.
- The task does not require specialized domain knowledge beyond general information about waste management and recycling, which the LLM can provide.
- The task does not involve complex visual analysis or detailed image processing, so image capabilities are not necessary.
- The task does not involve real-time decision-making or physical interaction, making it suitable for automation using an LLM.

Based on these considerations, the task of tagging garbage or recycling containers for informing customers aligns with the capabilities of an LLM for text-based communication and information provision. Therefore, this task falls under label E1 as the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality by handling the written communication aspect efficiently.
