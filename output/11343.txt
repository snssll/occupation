1: For the task of performing administrative duties, such as serving as a department head, the exposure to LLM can be analyzed as follows:

- E0: This task involves a high degree of human interaction and decision-making that impacts human livelihood. It requires leadership skills, interpersonal communication, and strategic decision-making, which cannot be effectively replaced by LLM or LLM-powered tools.

- E1: While the LLM can provide information and guidance on administrative tasks, such as drafting emails, preparing reports, or organizing data, it cannot fully replace the role of a department head. The complexity of the decisions and interactions involved in serving as a department head goes beyond the capabilities of the LLM.

- E2: It is conceivable that additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to assist with certain administrative tasks, such as scheduling, data analysis, or document management. However, the core responsibilities of serving as a department head, including leadership, personnel management, and strategic planning, would still require human expertise.

- E3: The image capabilities of the LLM are not relevant for this task, as it does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images.

Based on the analysis above, the task of performing administrative duties, such as serving as a department head, is best classified as E0.
