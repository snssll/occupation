1: In this task, a Tire Builder is responsible for trimming excess rubber and imperfections during retreading processes. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone or with additional software could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality.

- E0: This task involves physical work that cannot be automated by the LLM or any software tool. It requires manual dexterity and precision to trim excess rubber and imperfections, which cannot be replicated by text-based AI models.

- E1: The task of trimming excess rubber and imperfections is hands-on and requires physical manipulation of materials, which cannot be directly assisted by the LLM. While the LLM could potentially provide information on best practices or safety guidelines for tire building processes, it cannot directly perform the task itself.

- E2: While the LLM could potentially provide information on tire building processes, it cannot directly assist in trimming excess rubber and imperfections during retreading processes. However, it is conceivable that specialized software could be developed to provide real-time guidance or augmented reality tools to assist Tire Builders in identifying imperfections or guiding the trimming process.

- E3: The task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images, so the image capabilities of the LLM would not significantly impact the completion of this task.
