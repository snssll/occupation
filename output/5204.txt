1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of developing teaching materials as a Postsecondary Teaching Assistant, we need to consider the capabilities of the OpenAI large language model (LLM). The task involves creating various educational resources such as syllabi, visual aids, answer keys, supplementary notes, or course websites. The LLM can assist in generating text-based content, providing feedback on drafts, and even suggesting ideas for visual aids or supplementary notes. However, the LLM may not have the ability to create complex visual aids or design intricate course websites on its own. While it can help with text-based content creation, the task may require additional software tools beyond the LLM to fully automate the process of developing teaching materials.
