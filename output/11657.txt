1: In this task, a Wind Turbine Service Technician is required to perform routine maintenance on various components related to wind turbine equipment. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM could assist in providing detailed step-by-step instructions for performing routine maintenance on wind turbine equipment. It could generate maintenance checklists, troubleshoot common issues, or provide explanations for specific maintenance procedures. The LLM could also help in documenting maintenance logs or generating reports based on the maintenance performed.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to create interactive maintenance guides, augmented reality tools for visualizing maintenance procedures, or predictive maintenance models based on historical data and LLM-generated insights.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Since the task involves maintenance on physical equipment, having access to image capabilities could be beneficial. The LLM, in combination with image recognition technology, could assist in identifying components of wind turbine equipment, providing visual guides for maintenance tasks, or analyzing images of equipment to detect potential issues.

Based on the above analysis, the task of performing routine maintenance on wind turbine equipment could be best classified as E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications.
