1: In this task, a Manufacturing Engineer is required to stay updated on developments in the manufacturing field by reading current literature, talking with colleagues, participating in educational programs, attending meetings or workshops, and participating in professional organizations or conferences. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes for a Manufacturing Engineer to stay informed about developments in the manufacturing field through reading, summarizing, and providing insights on the latest literature, research, and trends. The LLM can assist in summarizing articles, providing insights, and even generating questions for further exploration based on the information provided. However, the LLM may not have direct access to up-to-date information unless it is explicitly mentioned in the input. Therefore, while the LLM can aid in some aspects of staying informed, it may not be able to provide real-time updates or access the most current information without specific input.
