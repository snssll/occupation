1: In this task, a helper production worker is required to perform minor repairs to machines, such as replacing damaged or worn parts. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves physical interaction with machines, which cannot be directly handled by an LLM.
- The task requires hands-on skills and knowledge of machinery, which are not within the capabilities of an LLM.
- The task involves practical knowledge of machine repair, which is not typically within the scope of text-based tasks that an LLM can handle.

Based on these considerations, it is clear that the task of performing minor repairs to machines is not something that can be significantly aided by an LLM. Therefore, the appropriate label is E0.

2: E0

3: High
