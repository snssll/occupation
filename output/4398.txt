1: In this task, a Surveying and Mapping Technician is required to design or develop information databases that include geographic or topographic data. To complete this task, the technician needs to organize and structure data related to geographic and topographic information in a database format. This task involves a significant amount of data organization, categorization, and structuring to ensure that the information is easily accessible and usable for mapping purposes.

Considering the task description, the most relevant exposure label from the rubric would be E2 - Exposure by LLM-powered applications. While the LLM alone may not reduce the time it takes to complete the task by half, it is easy to imagine additional software that could be developed on top of the LLM to assist in organizing and structuring geographic and topographic data efficiently. This software could potentially automate certain aspects of database design and development, making the process more streamlined and reducing the overall time required to complete the task.
