1: In this task, a First-Line Supervisor of Housekeeping and Janitorial Workers is required to instruct staff in work policies and procedures, as well as the use and maintenance of equipment. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we can break down the task:
- Writing and transforming text: The LLM can assist in generating detailed instructions on work policies, procedures, and equipment use.
- Providing edits to existing text: The LLM can help refine existing instructions or manuals for staff.
- Providing feedback on documents: The LLM can provide feedback on the clarity and effectiveness of instructional materials.
- Prepare training materials based on general knowledge: The LLM can aid in creating training materials for staff based on standard procedures and equipment guidelines.

Considering the task involves creating instructional materials, providing feedback, and preparing training materials, the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete these tasks with equivalent quality. Therefore, this task falls under label E1.
