1: In this task, the helper-production worker is responsible for packing and storing materials and products. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. Packing and storing materials and products involve physical actions such as lifting, moving, and organizing items. These actions cannot be directly performed by an LLM or any software tool. The task does not involve complex text input or output that would benefit significantly from the capabilities of an LLM. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM or any LLM-powered tool.

2: E0
