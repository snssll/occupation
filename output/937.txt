1: In this task, a Funeral Attendant is responsible for arranging floral offerings or lights around caskets. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone or with additional software could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality.

- E0: This task involves physical actions such as arranging flowers and lights, which cannot be done by the LLM or any software tool. The task also requires in-person presence and interaction, making it unsuitable for automation.

- E1: The LLM could potentially assist in generating text for written materials related to the floral offerings or lights, such as drafting descriptions or instructions. However, the core task of physically arranging the items cannot be automated by the LLM.

- E2: While the LLM could potentially provide information on different types of floral arrangements or lighting options, it cannot directly assist in physically arranging them. Developing software that could recommend specific arrangements based on input criteria might be possible but would not significantly reduce the time spent on the physical task.

- E3: The task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images, so the image capabilities of the LLM are not relevant here.

Based on the above analysis, the most appropriate exposure label for this task is E0.

2: E0

3: High
