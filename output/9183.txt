1: In this task, a Retail Salesperson is required to maintain knowledge of current sales and promotions, policies regarding payment and exchanges, and security practices. To determine the appropriate exposure label for this task in relation to the LLM, we can break it down as follows:

- **Maintain knowledge of current sales and promotions**: The LLM can assist in providing information on current sales and promotions by summarizing data from various sources, generating reports, or even suggesting strategies based on trends. This task could be significantly expedited with the LLM's ability to process and analyze large amounts of data quickly.

- **Policies regarding payment and exchanges**: The LLM can help in summarizing and explaining complex policies related to payment and exchanges. It can also assist in creating training materials or FAQs for employees to understand these policies better. This could save time in training and ensuring consistent understanding among staff.

- **Security practices**: The LLM can provide information on best security practices, help in creating security guidelines, or even generate responses to common security-related queries. It can also assist in updating security protocols based on the latest trends or threats.

Considering the above points, the task of maintaining knowledge of current sales and promotions, policies regarding payment and exchanges, and security practices could benefit significantly from the LLM's capabilities, especially in terms of information retrieval, summarization, and training material generation. Therefore, this task falls under **E1 - Direct exposure** as the LLM can reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality by at least half.
