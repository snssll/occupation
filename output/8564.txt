1: In this task of investigating reports of animal attacks or animal cruelty, an LLM could be used to assist in various aspects. The LLM could help in drafting interview questions for witnesses, providing guidance on collecting evidence effectively, and even generating initial drafts of the reports based on the collected information. The model could also assist in summarizing relevant laws or regulations related to animal control to ensure accurate reporting. However, the task also involves physical aspects such as collecting physical evidence and potentially interacting with animals, which the LLM cannot directly assist with. Overall, while the LLM can aid in several components of the task, it cannot fully replace the need for physical investigation and interaction.
