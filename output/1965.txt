1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of cleaning and polishing furniture and fixtures as a Janitor or Cleaner, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves physical cleaning and polishing, which cannot be directly performed by the LLM or any software tool. While the LLM can provide information on cleaning techniques, products, or safety guidelines, it cannot physically clean or polish objects. Therefore, this task does not fall under E1, E2, or E3 categories as it does not involve text-based tasks that can be significantly aided by the LLM.
