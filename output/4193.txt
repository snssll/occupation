1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of defining the goals of a system and devising flow charts and diagrams for logical operational steps of programs as a Computer Systems Analyst, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves writing and transforming text to describe logical operational steps, which the LLM can assist with by generating text based on the input provided. The LLM can help in creating flow charts and diagrams by providing textual descriptions that can be converted into visual representations by the user. While the LLM can aid in the textual aspects of this task, it may not directly reduce the time significantly for creating visual diagrams, which might require specialized software beyond the LLM's capabilities. Therefore, this task falls under E2 as additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to enhance the visualization aspect of creating flow charts and diagrams.
