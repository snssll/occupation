1: In this task, the Marriage and Family Therapist is required to ask questions that will help clients identify their feelings and behaviors. With the help of the LLM, the therapist could potentially generate a list of probing questions tailored to the client's situation, helping them delve deeper into their emotions and actions. The LLM could assist in crafting open-ended questions that encourage self-reflection and introspection. Additionally, the model could provide suggestions for follow-up questions based on the client's responses, aiding in the therapeutic process. Overall, the LLM could significantly reduce the time it takes for the therapist to prepare for and conduct these questioning sessions, enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of the therapy.
