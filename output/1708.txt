1: In this task, a Credit Authorizer, Checker, or Clerk is required to call customers to collect payment on delinquent accounts. With access to the powerful OpenAI large language model (LLM), the task could potentially be streamlined in the following ways:

- The LLM could assist in drafting scripts or templates for communication with customers, ensuring that the language used is professional, persuasive, and compliant with regulations.
- The LLM could provide guidance on negotiation tactics and strategies to effectively handle different customer responses during the collection calls.
- The LLM could help in analyzing customer data and payment histories to tailor collection strategies based on individual customer profiles.
- The LLM could generate reminders or follow-up messages to be sent to customers after the initial collection calls.

Considering these points, the task of calling customers to collect payment on delinquent accounts could benefit significantly from the LLM's capabilities in providing guidance, generating communication materials, and analyzing data to enhance collection strategies. Therefore, this task falls under the category of E1 - Direct exposure.
