1: Special Effects Artists and Animators create two-dimensional and three-dimensional images depicting objects in motion or illustrating a process using computer animation or modeling programs. This task involves a high level of creativity, artistic skill, and specialized knowledge of animation software. While an LLM could potentially assist with generating ideas, providing feedback on scripts, or even helping with some aspects of the animation process through text-based instructions, the actual creation of images and animations is a highly visual and hands-on task that requires precise control over design elements, movement, and visual effects. The LLM does not have the capability to directly create or manipulate images or animations, especially in a detailed and visually appealing manner. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not significantly benefit from LLM capabilities in reducing the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete the task.
