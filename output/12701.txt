1: In this task, a Correspondence Clerk is responsible for preparing records for shipment by certified mail. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be impacted by the use of the LLM.

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** The task involves preparing records for shipment, which primarily requires following a set process and ensuring accuracy in documentation. The LLM could potentially assist in providing guidance on the specific steps involved in preparing records for certified mail, such as outlining the necessary documentation, packaging requirements, or addressing details. The LLM could also help in generating any written communication that needs to accompany the shipment. Overall, the LLM could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality by providing detailed instructions and templates for the correspondence clerk to follow.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the task itself is relatively straightforward and does not involve complex decision-making, there may be additional software developed on top of the LLM that could automate parts of the process. For example, an application could be created that retrieves shipping information, generates mailing labels, or tracks the shipment status automatically. This additional software could streamline the process further, but the task itself may not require such advanced capabilities to be completed efficiently.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Image capabilities would not significantly impact the completion of this task as it primarily involves preparing records for shipment by certified mail, which is text-based. The task does not require image processing, scanning, or editing, so the image capabilities provided by the LLM would not be relevant in this context.
