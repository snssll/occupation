1: In this task, a landscaping and groundskeeping worker is required to attach wires from planted trees to support stakes. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task and the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves physical work that cannot be directly performed by the LLM, as it requires manual labor and being on-site. The LLM cannot assist in tasks that involve physical actions such as attaching wires to support stakes in real-world settings. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM or any tools built on top of it.

2: E0

3: High
