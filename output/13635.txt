1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of quoting unit exchange rates as a teller, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it. 

- The task involves providing unit exchange rates based on daily international rate sheets or computer displays. This task primarily requires accessing and interpreting information accurately and quickly.
- The LLM can assist in providing up-to-date exchange rate information from the internet or other sources, which could help streamline the process of quoting rates.
- The LLM can also help in summarizing complex rate sheets or data, making it easier for the teller to quickly access the necessary information.
- While the task does not involve complex decision-making or specialized domain knowledge, the LLM's ability to retrieve and summarize information could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality.

Based on these considerations, the task of quoting unit exchange rates as a teller would likely fall under label E1 - Direct exposure.
