1: In this task, the Gambling and Sports Book Writers and Runners are responsible for computing and verifying amounts won or lost by patrons, paying out winnings, and referring patrons to gaming cashiers to collect their winnings. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves computation, verification, and referral based on specific rules and calculations related to gambling and sports betting. While the task involves some level of decision-making and interaction with patrons, the core activities revolve around processing information and performing calculations accurately.

Given that the task primarily involves processing and verifying information, an LLM could potentially assist in automating the computation and verification process. The model could be trained on the specific rules and calculations involved in gambling and sports betting to accurately compute amounts won or lost. It could also provide guidance on referring patrons to gaming cashiers based on predefined criteria. However, the task may also require human judgment in certain situations, such as handling disputes or complex scenarios that may not have clear-cut answers.
