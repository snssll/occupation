1: In this task, a Weighers, Measurers, Checkers, and Samplers, Recordkeeping worker is responsible for maintaining, monitoring, and cleaning work areas. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if the task can be significantly expedited or improved by using the LLM. The task involves physical activities such as cleaning work areas, which cannot be directly assisted by the LLM. While the LLM could potentially provide guidance on recordkeeping or documentation related to the work areas, the core aspect of cleaning and monitoring physical spaces is not something the LLM can directly assist with. Therefore, the task does not align with the capabilities of the LLM, and it falls under E0.

2: E0
