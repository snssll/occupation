1: In this task, a paperhanger applies acetic acid to damp plaster to prevent lime from bleeding through paper. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. This task involves a physical action of applying acetic acid to a surface, which cannot be directly performed by an LLM. The task also requires specific knowledge and skills related to paperhanging and construction, which may not be easily accessible or accurately provided by the LLM. Additionally, the task involves working with potentially hazardous materials, which require proper training and safety precautions that an LLM cannot provide. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not involve text-based activities that can be significantly aided by an LLM.
