1: In this task, an electrician is required to test electrical systems or continuity of circuits using testing devices like ohmmeters, voltmeters, or oscilloscopes to ensure compatibility and safety of the system. This task involves technical knowledge and hands-on skills in electrical systems. The task does not involve text input or output, and the context is more practical and physical rather than text-based. The LLM, even though powerful in text-related tasks, does not have the capability to physically test electrical systems or circuits. Therefore, the task does not fall under E1, E2, or E3 exposure categories as it does not involve text-based interactions or image capabilities that the LLM can assist with.
