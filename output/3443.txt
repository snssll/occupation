1: In this task, a Patternmaker, Wood is responsible for constructing wooden models, templates, full-scale mock-ups, jigs, or molds for shaping parts of products. To determine the appropriate exposure label for this task in relation to the LLM, we need to consider the nature of the work involved. 

- The task involves physical construction of wooden models and templates, which requires hands-on skills and precision.
- The task does not involve text-based inputs or outputs that can be easily processed by the LLM.
- The task is highly specialized and requires domain-specific knowledge of woodworking techniques and materials.
- The task does not involve written documents, data analysis, or decision-making based on text inputs.

Based on these considerations, it is evident that the task of constructing wooden models as a Patternmaker, Wood falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM or any tools built on top of it to significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task.
