1: In this task, a Customer Service Representative is required to complete contract forms, prepare change of address records, or issue service discontinuance orders using computers. With the help of the powerful OpenAI large language model (LLM), the representative could potentially automate the process of completing contract forms by generating the necessary text based on input criteria. The LLM could also assist in preparing change of address records by providing templates or generating the required information based on customer input. Additionally, the LLM could help in issuing service discontinuance orders by generating the necessary documentation or providing guidance on the process.

Considering the nature of the task and the capabilities of the LLM, it falls under E1 - Direct exposure. The LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete these tasks by automating the generation of text and providing guidance on the necessary steps.
