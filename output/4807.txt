1: In this task, a nurse anesthetist is responsible for developing anesthesia care plans for patients undergoing surgery or other medical procedures. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM can assist in completing it. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM can help in generating text-based anesthesia care plans based on the input provided about the patient's medical history, procedure details, and other relevant information. The model can assist in writing and transforming text according to complex instructions, which aligns with the task of developing anesthesia care plans.
- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time it takes to develop anesthesia care plans, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to summarize complex medical information, provide recommendations based on data, or retrieve specialized medical knowledge to enhance the care plans.
- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not directly relevant to developing anesthesia care plans, as the task primarily involves text-based information and medical data analysis.
