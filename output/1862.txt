1: In this task, a Stationary Engineer or Boiler Operator is responsible for checking the air quality of ventilation systems and making adjustments to ensure compliance with safety codes. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves assessing air quality, which may require knowledge of safety codes and regulations. The LLM can provide information on safety codes and regulations related to air quality.
- The task also involves making adjustments to ventilation systems based on the assessment. While the LLM can provide general information on ventilation systems, it may not have the specific technical knowledge required to make precise adjustments.
- The task does not involve complex data analysis or specialized domain knowledge that would require additional software beyond the LLM.
- The task does not involve image processing or detailed visual analysis.

Based on these considerations, the task falls under E2 - Exposure by LLM-powered applications. While the LLM can provide information on safety codes and regulations, additional software tailored to the technical aspects of ventilation systems may further enhance the efficiency of completing this task.
