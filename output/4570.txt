1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of determining depreciation rates and advising management on actions regarding the purchase, lease, or disposal of capitalized items, we need to consider the level of automation and assistance that the LLM can provide in completing this task.

- The task involves analyzing financial data and providing recommendations based on that analysis, which falls within the capabilities of the LLM.
- The LLM can assist in calculating depreciation rates based on provided data and guidelines.
- The LLM can generate recommendations for management actions based on the analysis of financial information and industry best practices.
- The task does not involve precise measurements or detailed visual analysis, which are limitations for the LLM.
- While the task may require some domain-specific knowledge in finance and accounting, the LLM can still provide valuable insights and recommendations based on the information provided.

Based on these considerations, the task falls under E1 as the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality by providing calculations, analysis, and recommendations related to financial data and management decisions.
