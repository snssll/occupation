1: In this task, a locksmith is required to insert new or repaired tumblers into locks to change combinations. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves a physical action of inserting tumblers into locks, which cannot be directly performed by an LLM or any software tool. While the LLM could potentially provide information on how to change lock combinations or offer guidance on locksmithing techniques, it cannot physically insert tumblers into locks. Therefore, this task falls under the E0 category as it involves a high degree of physical interaction that cannot be replaced by the LLM or any software tool.
