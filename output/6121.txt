1: In this task, a photographer is required to enhance, retouch, and resize photographs and negatives using techniques like airbrushing. With the capabilities of the large language model (LLM), it is possible to provide instructions, guidance, and even generate text descriptions for the retouching and enhancing process. The LLM can assist in suggesting techniques, providing step-by-step instructions, and even offering creative ideas for improving the quality of the photographs. However, the LLM does not have direct image editing capabilities, so it cannot directly manipulate the images themselves. While it can provide textual guidance, the actual editing work would still need to be done by a human using image editing software. Therefore, this task falls under E2 exposure as additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to streamline the editing process by integrating image editing capabilities.
