1: In this task, a Correspondence Clerk is responsible for ensuring that money collected is properly recorded and secured. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be completed with the help of an LLM.

- The task involves recording and securing money, which is a practical, hands-on task that requires physical actions such as handling cash, using secure storage, and following specific procedures.
- While the LLM can provide guidance on record-keeping procedures and security measures in written form, it cannot physically handle money or secure it.
- The task does not involve complex data analysis, specialized domain knowledge, or detailed written documentation that would significantly benefit from the LLM's capabilities.
- The task does not involve image processing, reading text from PDFs, or creating/editing digital images, so the image capabilities of the LLM are not relevant here.

Based on these considerations, the task of ensuring that money collected is properly recorded and secured falls under E0 as it does not clearly benefit from the use of an LLM to reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete the task.
