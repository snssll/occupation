1: In this task, the helper is responsible for signaling workers to start geological material extraction or boring. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves a physical action of signaling workers, which cannot be directly performed by an LLM. The task does not involve complex data analysis, decision-making, or information retrieval that would significantly benefit from LLM capabilities. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM or any tools built on top of it.

2: E0
