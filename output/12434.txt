1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of preparing charts or graphs from data samples as an Environmental Scientist, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves transforming data into visual representations and providing summary information, which can be done through text output. The LLM can assist in generating text descriptions of the data and its environmental relevance, but it does not have direct image capabilities to create charts or graphs. While additional software could potentially be developed to work alongside the LLM to automate the creation of charts or graphs based on the text output, this would require significant development beyond the current capabilities of the LLM. Therefore, the task does not fall under E1 as the LLM alone cannot reduce the time it takes to complete the task by at least half. It also does not fall under E2 as the task does not involve highly specialized domain knowledge or complex databases that could be leveraged by additional software. Since the task does not require image capabilities for detailed visual analysis, it does not fall under E3 either. Thus, the most appropriate label for this task is E0.

2: E0

3: Moderate
