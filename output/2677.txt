1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of completing birth certificates as a midwife, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it. 

- E0: This task involves filling out official documents that require accuracy and legal validity. It does not involve complex decision-making or specialized knowledge that the LLM could significantly enhance. The task also does not involve any visual or image processing that would benefit from additional capabilities beyond text processing.

- E1: While the LLM could potentially assist in generating standard text for birth certificates or providing guidance on specific sections, the task of completing birth certificates likely requires human judgment, verification of information, and legal compliance that the LLM alone cannot provide. The task may involve sensitive information that requires human oversight.

- E2: It is conceivable that specialized software could be developed on top of the LLM to streamline the process of completing birth certificates by automating certain sections, cross-referencing data, or providing templates. This software could potentially reduce the time it takes to complete the task by half by integrating with existing databases or legal frameworks.

- E3: The task of completing birth certificates does not involve image processing or detailed visual information that would benefit from additional image capabilities. Therefore, the task does not fall under this category.
