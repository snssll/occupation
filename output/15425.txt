1: In this task, an Insurance Sales Agent is required to seek out new clients and develop clientele by networking to find new customers and generate lists of prospective clients. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves networking to find new customers, which may require writing emails, making phone calls, or attending events to connect with potential clients. The LLM could potentially assist in drafting effective emails or scripts for phone calls to reach out to prospective clients (E1).
- While the LLM could help in generating lists of prospective clients by providing templates or suggestions, the task also involves human interaction and building relationships, which may not be significantly expedited by the LLM alone (E2).
- The task does not involve any image-related capabilities, so E3 does not apply.

Based on the analysis above, the task seems to align most closely with E2 as the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task by at least half, but additional software could be developed to enhance the process.

2: E2

3: Moderate
