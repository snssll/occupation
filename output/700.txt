1: In this task, a Real Estate Sales Agent is required to answer clients' questions regarding various aspects of real estate, including construction work, financing, maintenance, repairs, and appraisals. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves providing information and answering questions related to real estate, which can be effectively handled by an LLM through text input and output.
- The LLM can assist in generating responses based on general knowledge and information available in the text input.
- The task does not involve precise measurements, detailed visuals, or human interaction that would require physical presence.
- The LLM can help in summarizing information, providing explanations, and responding to inquiries related to real estate topics.

Based on these considerations, the task can be significantly expedited and completed with equivalent quality by utilizing the LLM's capabilities. Therefore, the appropriate label for this task would be E1.
