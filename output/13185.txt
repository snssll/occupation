1: In this task, a Library Assistant, Clerical is required to provide assistance to librarians in maintaining collections of various materials. This task involves organizing, cataloging, and shelving items, as well as helping patrons locate materials. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider whether access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality.

- E0: This task involves physical organization and interaction with materials in a library setting, which cannot be directly replaced by the LLM. The LLM cannot physically handle books, periodicals, or other materials, so it cannot significantly reduce the time required for this task.

- E1: While the LLM can provide information on cataloging systems, book organization, and other related topics, it cannot physically assist in shelving or organizing materials. The task of providing hands-on assistance in maintaining collections is not something the LLM can directly perform.

- E2: It is conceivable that additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to assist with cataloging, organizing, and maintaining library collections. This software could potentially automate certain aspects of the task, such as generating catalog entries or suggesting optimal shelving arrangements based on metadata. However, the physical nature of the task still requires human intervention.

- E3: The task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images, so the image capabilities of the LLM are not directly relevant to this task.

Based on the above analysis, the most appropriate label for this task is E2.

2: E2

3: Moderate
