1: In this task, a Postal Service Mail Carrier is required to scan labels on letters or parcels to confirm receipt. With the help of a large language model (LLM), the carrier could potentially automate the process of scanning labels by using optical character recognition (OCR) technology to extract text from images of the labels. The LLM could then interpret the text to confirm receipt of the letters or parcels. This task involves reading text from images, which could be significantly expedited with the assistance of an LLM.

Considering the capabilities of the LLM to process text and potentially assist in image recognition tasks, this task could be classified as E3. The LLM could be used to read text from images, such as labels on letters or parcels, thereby reducing the time it takes to confirm receipt.

2: E3

3: Moderate
