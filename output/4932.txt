1: In this task, an Audio and Video Technician is required to develop manuals, texts, workbooks, or related materials for use in conjunction with production materials or for training purposes. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- Writing manuals, texts, and workbooks involves a significant amount of text generation and transformation, which can be efficiently handled by the large language model (LLM).
- The task does not involve complex image processing or detailed visual work, so the image capabilities of the LLM are not necessary.
- While the task may benefit from specialized domain knowledge related to audio and video production, the LLM can still assist in generating and organizing the written content for manuals and training materials.

Based on these considerations, the task can be significantly expedited and improved in quality by utilizing the LLM for text generation, organization, and potentially even content suggestions based on domain-specific knowledge.
