1: In this task, the Heating, Air Conditioning, and Refrigeration Mechanics and Installers are required to install dehumidifiers or related equipment in spaces like computer rooms that need cool, dry air to operate efficiently. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we can break down the task:
- Research: The LLM can provide information on the latest dehumidifier models, installation techniques, and best practices for computer room environments.
- Writing: The LLM can assist in drafting installation instructions, safety guidelines, or reports related to the installation process.
- Problem-solving: The LLM can help troubleshoot common issues during installation or provide alternative solutions based on input data.
- Decision-making: While the LLM can provide recommendations, the final decision on installation specifics would likely require human judgment based on on-site conditions.

Considering the task involves physical installation work, precise measurements, and hands-on expertise, it falls under the E0 category. The task requires practical skills and direct physical interaction, which cannot be substituted by the LLM.
