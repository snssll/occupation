1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of teaching sociology as a sociologist, we need to consider how the LLM can assist in this specific task. 

- E0: Teaching sociology involves a high degree of human interaction, which cannot be effectively replaced by the LLM. The nuances of teaching, such as adapting to students' learning styles, providing real-time feedback, and engaging in discussions, require human presence and interaction. The LLM cannot replicate these aspects.

- E1: While the LLM can provide information on sociology topics, summarize key concepts, and generate teaching materials based on general knowledge, it cannot fully replace the role of a sociologist in teaching. The interactive and dynamic nature of teaching sociology goes beyond what the LLM can achieve independently.

- E2: It is conceivable that additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to assist sociologists in preparing teaching materials, generating quizzes, or providing supplementary information. However, the core task of teaching sociology, which involves direct interaction with students, facilitating discussions, and assessing learning, remains primarily a human-driven activity.

- E3: The image capabilities of the LLM are not relevant for the task of teaching sociology, as it does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images.

Based on the above analysis, the most appropriate label for the task of teaching sociology is E0.

2: E0

3: High
