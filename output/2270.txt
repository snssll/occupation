1: In this task, the Adult Basic Education, Adult Secondary Education, and English as a Second Language Instructors are required to collaborate with other teachers and professionals in the development of instructional programs. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. Collaborating with others involves communication, sharing ideas, and working together to create educational programs. While an LLM can assist in generating text, providing feedback, and even suggesting ideas, the collaborative aspect of this task involves human interaction, understanding different perspectives, and real-time communication that goes beyond what an LLM can currently achieve. The task also involves a level of creativity, empathy, and understanding of educational principles that may be challenging for an LLM to fully grasp. Therefore, the task does not fit into categories E1, E2, or E3 as it requires human collaboration and expertise that cannot be fully replicated by an LLM.
