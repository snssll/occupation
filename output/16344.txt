1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of studying blueprints as a Boilermaker, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. In this task, the Boilermaker needs to analyze blueprints to understand the locations, relationships, and dimensions of parts. While the LLM can assist with text-based tasks, it does not have the ability to view or interpret visual information such as blueprints. The task of studying blueprints requires a high level of visual analysis and understanding of technical drawings, which is beyond the current capabilities of the LLM. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as the LLM alone cannot significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete the task of studying blueprints.
