1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of collaborating with biologists and other professionals to conduct genetic and biochemical analyses as a Geneticist, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be aided by the use of a large language model (LLM).

- E1: Direct exposure - In this task, the Geneticist would need to communicate effectively with biologists and other professionals, potentially through written communication. An LLM could assist in drafting emails, reports, or other written materials related to the analyses being conducted. The LLM could help in summarizing findings, generating questions, or providing feedback on documents related to the analyses. Therefore, direct access to the LLM could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the task involves collaboration and analysis, which could potentially benefit from specialized domain knowledge or recommendations, the core of the task involves communication and coordination. An LLM alone may not reduce the time it takes to complete the task by half, but additional software built on top of the LLM could potentially enhance the collaboration process by summarizing complex genetic and biochemical information, providing recommendations based on data, or analyzing written information to inform decisions.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - This task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images. Therefore, image capabilities would not significantly impact the completion of this task.

Based on the above analysis, the most fitting label for this task is E1: Direct exposure.

2: E1

3: High
