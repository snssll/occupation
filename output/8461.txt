1: In this task, an Instructional Coordinator is required to interview subject-matter experts or conduct research to develop instructional content. With access to the powerful OpenAI large language model (LLM), the coordinator could potentially use the LLM to generate interview questions based on the subject matter, summarize research findings, draft instructional content, or even assist in conducting virtual interviews. The LLM could also help in organizing and structuring the gathered information efficiently. Overall, the LLM could significantly streamline the process of developing instructional content by providing valuable insights, questions, and content generation support.

Considering the capabilities of the LLM in assisting with tasks related to generating questions, summarizing information, and providing content support, this task falls under the E1 category. The LLM can directly reduce the time it takes to complete the task by offering assistance in various aspects of the research and content development process.
