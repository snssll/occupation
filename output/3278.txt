1: In this task, a Residential Advisor is required to confer with medical personnel to better understand the backgrounds and needs of individual residents. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves communication and information gathering, which can be effectively handled by an LLM through text-based interactions. The LLM can assist in summarizing information provided by medical personnel, generating questions to ask them, and even drafting emails for follow-up. While the task involves some level of human interaction and understanding of medical information, the core of the task can be supported by the LLM's text-based capabilities.
