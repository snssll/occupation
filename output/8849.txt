1: In this task, a glazier is responsible for loading and arranging glass or mirrors onto delivery trucks using tools like suction cups or cranes. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM could significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality. Since this task involves physical labor, such as lifting and arranging heavy glass, it cannot be directly assisted by the LLM. The LLM does not have the capability to perform physical tasks or interact with physical objects like glass or mirrors. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not meet the criteria for exposure to LLM capabilities.

2: E0

3: High
