1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of preparing and delivering lectures to undergraduate or graduate students as an Art, Drama, and Music Teacher, Postsecondary, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The task involves creating and delivering lectures, which heavily relies on written and spoken communication. The LLM can assist in generating lecture content, providing information on acting techniques, music fundamentals, and art history. It can also help in structuring the lectures and ensuring the content is engaging and informative. Additionally, the LLM can aid in responding to student questions or providing additional resources related to the topics.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM can provide valuable assistance in generating lecture content and answering questions, there may be additional software that could be developed on top of the LLM to further enhance the efficiency of preparing and delivering lectures. This software could potentially include features like summarizing complex academic texts, retrieving up-to-date information for lectures, or even creating interactive multimedia presentations.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - The task of preparing and delivering lectures may not heavily rely on image capabilities, as the focus is more on verbal communication and possibly using visual aids like slides or diagrams. While the LLM could potentially assist in creating or editing digital images for presentations, this aspect may not be a significant factor in completing the task.
