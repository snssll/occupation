1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of specifying inputs accessed by the system and planning the distribution and use of the results for Computer Systems Analysts, we need to consider the nature of the task. This task involves analyzing and organizing data inputs for a computer system, which can be a complex and information-intensive process. The task requires understanding the system's requirements, identifying relevant data sources, and strategizing how to utilize the results effectively.

Given that this task involves working with text-based information and making decisions based on that information, it aligns closely with the capabilities of a large language model (LLM). The LLM can assist in processing and organizing textual data, generating insights, and providing recommendations based on the inputs provided. The LLM can help streamline the process of specifying inputs and planning the distribution and use of results by offering insights, suggestions, and potentially even drafting documentation or reports.

Considering the task's reliance on text-based information processing and decision-making, as well as the potential for the LLM to significantly enhance the efficiency and quality of the process, the task falls under the category of E1 - Direct exposure.
