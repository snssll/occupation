1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of recommending the purchase of equipment to control dust, temperature, and humidity in an area of system installation for Computer Hardware Engineers, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves understanding the requirements for environmental control in a specific area, which may require knowledge of different types of equipment, their specifications, and how they interact with the hardware systems being installed.

- E0: This task does not involve direct text-based interactions that can be easily automated by the LLM. It requires specialized knowledge of hardware systems and environmental control equipment, which may not be readily available in text form for the LLM to generate recommendations.

- E1: While the LLM can provide general information on environmental control equipment, it may not have the specific domain knowledge required to make tailored recommendations for Computer Hardware Engineers. The task involves expertise in hardware systems and environmental control, which may not be easily automated by the LLM alone.

- E2: It is conceivable that additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to assist in recommending equipment for environmental control. This software could potentially integrate with databases of hardware specifications and environmental control requirements to provide more targeted recommendations. However, this would require specialized domain knowledge and may not reduce the time to complete the task by half.

- E3: The task does not involve image capabilities, so this label does not apply.

2: E2

3: Moderate
