1: In this task, a Mental Health and Substance Abuse Social Worker is required to counsel or aid family members to help them understand, deal with, or support the client or patient. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. This task involves providing emotional support, guidance, and counseling to family members of clients or patients. While an LLM can provide general information on mental health and substance abuse, it lacks the ability to provide personalized counseling or emotional support tailored to individual family members' needs. The task also involves a high degree of human interaction and emotional intelligence, which are essential in the field of social work. Therefore, the task of counseling or aiding family members in this context is best suited for human professionals with specialized training and experience in mental health and substance abuse social work.
