1: In this task, a real estate broker acts as an intermediary in negotiations between buyers and sellers over property prices and settlement details. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves a high degree of human interaction, negotiation skills, and legal knowledge related to real estate transactions. It requires understanding the needs and preferences of both buyers and sellers, as well as navigating complex legal and financial aspects of property sales. The task also involves face-to-face interactions, building trust, and providing personalized advice based on individual circumstances. These aspects of the task are not easily replicable by an LLM or any software tool. Therefore, the task falls under E0 as it does not clearly decrease the time it takes for an experienced real estate broker to complete the task with high quality by at least half.
