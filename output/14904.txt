1: In this task, a psychiatric technician is required to restrain violent, potentially violent, or suicidal patients by verbal or physical means as necessary. This task involves a high level of human interaction and physical intervention, which cannot be replaced by an LLM or any tool built on top of it. The task also requires real-time assessment of the patient's behavior and immediate response, which is beyond the capabilities of an LLM. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it cannot be significantly expedited or improved by the use of an LLM.
