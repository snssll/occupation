1: For the task of auditioning performers for dance parts, the choreographer needs to evaluate the dancers' skills, creativity, and ability to interpret and perform choreography. This task involves subjective judgment based on artistic criteria, which may not be easily quantifiable. While an LLM could potentially assist in providing general guidance on what to look for in dancers or suggest interview questions, the core of the task involves in-person interaction, observation of physical movement, and artistic judgment, which are not easily replicable by an LLM. Therefore, the task does not seem to benefit significantly from LLM assistance in reducing the time it takes to complete the task.
