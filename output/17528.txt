1: In this task, the occupation of Airline Pilots, Copilots, and Flight Engineers involves using instrumentation to guide flights when visibility is poor. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. Using instrumentation to guide flights in poor visibility requires specialized knowledge, training, and real-time decision-making skills. While an LLM could potentially provide information on flight instruments and procedures, it cannot physically operate the instruments or make real-time decisions during a flight. Additionally, safety-critical tasks like flying an aircraft require human expertise and judgment, which cannot be replaced by an LLM. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it involves precise, real-time decision-making and actions that cannot be automated by an LLM.
