1: In this task, a Clinical Research Coordinator is responsible for assessing the eligibility of potential subjects for clinical trials. This involves conducting screening interviews, reviewing medical records, and discussing with healthcare professionals. To determine the appropriate exposure label for this task:

- E1: Direct access to the LLM could potentially reduce the time it takes to complete this task by providing templates for screening interviews, suggesting relevant questions to ask during interviews, or offering guidance on reviewing medical records efficiently.
- E2: While additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to streamline the process further by automatically extracting relevant information from medical records or providing real-time eligibility assessments based on input data, the current capabilities of the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time to complete the task.
- E3: Image capabilities are not relevant for this task as it primarily involves text-based information and interactions with healthcare professionals.

Based on the above analysis, the most appropriate exposure label for this task is E2.

2: E2

3: Moderate
