1: In this task, a chemist is required to develop, improve, or customize products, equipment, formulas, processes, or analytical methods. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- Developing products, equipment, formulas, processes, or analytical methods involves a high level of domain-specific knowledge and expertise in chemistry.
- While an LLM can provide general information and potentially assist with basic research, it may not have the specialized knowledge required for tasks specific to chemistry.
- The task involves a high degree of creativity, experimentation, and practical application of chemical principles, which may be beyond the capabilities of the LLM.
- Chemists often rely on hands-on experimentation and laboratory work, which cannot be performed by the LLM.

Based on these considerations, it is unlikely that the LLM alone or tools built on top of it could significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced chemist to complete this task with high quality. Therefore, this task is best classified as E0 - No exposure.

2: E0

3: High
