1: In this task, the Real Estate Sales Agents are required to advise clients on various aspects related to real estate transactions, including market conditions, prices, mortgages, legal requirements, and related matters. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes for a real estate agent to provide accurate and detailed advice to clients on these matters. 

Given that the LLM can provide up-to-date information on market conditions, legal requirements, and mortgage rates, it can assist real estate agents in staying informed and providing relevant advice to clients. The LLM can also help in generating responses to common client queries and providing explanations on complex legal terms or processes. However, the task also involves a high degree of human interaction and personalized advice tailored to individual clients, which may not be fully automated by the LLM. While the LLM can provide general information and insights, the task of advising clients on real estate matters may still require the expertise and judgment of a human real estate agent.
