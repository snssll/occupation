1: In this task, a Public Relations Specialist is required to prepare or deliver speeches to further public relations objectives. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM can assist in completing it. 

- The task involves writing and delivering speeches, which can benefit from the LLM's capabilities in generating text and providing language suggestions.
- The LLM can help in crafting persuasive and engaging speeches by providing suggestions, examples, and even generating content based on input criteria.
- The LLM can assist in tailoring the speech to specific audiences, ensuring the message aligns with the public relations objectives.
- While the LLM can aid in the speechwriting process, it may not significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced Public Relations Specialist to deliver the speech in person.

Based on these considerations, the task of preparing or delivering speeches as a Public Relations Specialist could be classified as E1 - Direct exposure.
