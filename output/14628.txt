1: In this task, a Gambling Surveillance Officer or Investigator is required to report violations and suspicious behaviors to supervisors, either verbally or in writing. With the help of the LLM, the officer could potentially draft reports, summarize incidents, and provide detailed descriptions of suspicious behaviors. The LLM could also assist in crafting clear and concise communication to supervisors. However, the task involves a level of judgment and decision-making that may not be easily automated by the LLM alone. While the LLM can aid in generating text, the final decision to report a violation or suspicious behavior still relies on the officer's assessment. Therefore, the task does not fall under E1 as it cannot be fully automated by the LLM. It also does not fit E2 as the task involves a significant level of human judgment that may not be easily replicated by additional software.
