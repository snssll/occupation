1: In this task, a helper production worker is required to mix ingredients according to specified procedures or formulas. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be aided by the LLM. 

- The task involves following specific procedures or formulas, which may not require complex decision-making or specialized knowledge beyond what is provided in the instructions.
- The LLM can potentially assist by providing guidance on following procedures, clarifying any ambiguities in the instructions, or even suggesting alternative mixing methods based on the given formulas.
- The task does not involve highly specialized domain knowledge or complex decision-making that would require additional software beyond the capabilities of the LLM.
- The LLM can easily generate text instructions or explanations to aid in the mixing process, making it a suitable tool for this task.

Based on these considerations, the task of mixing ingredients according to specified procedures or formulas would likely fall under the E1 label, as direct access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality.
