1: In this task, a Fence Erector is required to attach rails or tension wire along the bottoms of posts to form fencing frames. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. This task involves physical work that requires manual labor and precise measurements. It does not involve complex written instructions, data analysis, or decision-making that could be significantly aided by an LLM. The task is straightforward and does not involve text input or output that could be enhanced by the language model. Therefore, the task does not align with any of the exposure levels in the rubric.
