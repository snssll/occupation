1: In this task, a web developer needs to analyze user needs to determine technical requirements for a website or web application. With access to the powerful OpenAI large language model (LLM), the developer can utilize the model to assist in understanding and interpreting user needs, researching technical solutions, and formulating the necessary technical requirements based on the analysis. The LLM can help in generating ideas, providing insights, and suggesting best practices in web development based on the input provided about user needs. This task involves a significant amount of text analysis, research, and decision-making, all of which can be supported by the LLM.

Considering the capabilities of the LLM to assist in text analysis, research, and decision-making related to technical requirements, this task falls under E1 - Direct exposure. The LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes for a web developer to analyze user needs and determine technical requirements by providing valuable insights and suggestions.
