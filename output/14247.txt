1: In this task, a Claims Adjuster, Examiner, or Investigator is required to refer questionable claims to an investigator or claims adjuster for further investigation or settlement. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- E0: This task involves decision-making based on the assessment of the validity of claims, which requires human judgment and expertise. It also involves potentially complex legal and investigative processes that cannot be fully automated by an LLM.
- E1: While an LLM could potentially assist in drafting communication or documentation related to the referral process, the core decision-making and investigative aspects of the task are likely beyond the capabilities of the LLM alone.
- E2: An LLM-powered application could potentially assist in summarizing information related to the claims or providing background research on similar cases. However, the task still heavily relies on human judgment and expertise.
- E3: Image capabilities would not significantly impact this task as it is primarily text-based and does not involve detailed visual analysis.

Considering the above points, the most appropriate label for this task is E2.

2: E2

3: Moderate
