1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of managing tracking and reporting of search-related activities and providing analyses to marketing executives as a Search Marketing Strategist, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be impacted by the use of a large language model (LLM).

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** The task involves analyzing data, preparing reports, and providing insights to marketing executives. An LLM can assist in generating written reports, summarizing data, and even providing recommendations based on the analysis. The LLM can help in transforming raw data into actionable insights, which can save time for the strategist in preparing reports and analyses.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the LLM can assist in generating text-based reports and analyses, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to automate the process further. This software could include features like automatically retrieving data from various sources, integrating real-time data for up-to-date analyses, and providing more advanced insights beyond what the LLM alone can offer.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Image capabilities are not directly relevant to the task of managing tracking and reporting of search-related activities. The task primarily involves working with text-based data and providing analyses to marketing executives, which can be effectively handled by the LLM without the need for image capabilities.
