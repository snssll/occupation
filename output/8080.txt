1: In this task, the occupation involves installing boilers, containers, and other structures. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone or with additional software could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality. 

Given that the task involves physical installation work that requires hands-on skills, precise measurements, and potentially working in hazardous environments, it is unlikely that the LLM or any software built on top of it could directly assist in completing the task. The task does not involve text-based instructions, data analysis, decision-making based on information, or any other aspect where the LLM could provide substantial assistance. Therefore, the task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM or any software that could be developed on top of it.
