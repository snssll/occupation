1: In this task, a Construction Manager or Project Management Specialist is required to prepare and submit budget estimates, progress reports, or cost tracking reports. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves writing and transforming text (budget estimates, progress reports, cost tracking reports) according to specific instructions.
- The task does not require accessing up-to-date facts from the internet unless they are provided in the input.
- The task does not involve highly specialized domain knowledge that the LLM alone cannot provide.
- The task does not involve creating or editing digital images.
- The task does not require detailed measurements or precise visual analysis.
- The task does not involve human interaction, physical demonstrations, or decision-making that impacts human livelihood.

Based on these considerations, the task can be effectively completed with the help of the LLM by generating text outputs based on the input provided. Therefore, this task falls under label E1 as the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality.
