1: In this task, an Ophthalmic Laboratory Technician is responsible for removing lenses from molds and separating them into containers for further processing or storage. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. This task involves manual labor and physical dexterity to handle delicate lenses, which cannot be directly assisted by an LLM. The task does not involve complex decision-making, specialized knowledge retrieval, or document analysis that would benefit significantly from LLM capabilities. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM or any tools built on top of it.
