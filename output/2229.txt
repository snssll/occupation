1: In this task, a Financial and Investment Analyst collaborates with investment bankers to attract new corporate clients. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves collaboration, communication, and strategic planning to attract new clients. While the LLM can provide information and insights related to financial analysis and investment strategies, it may not directly assist in the collaboration aspect of working with investment bankers. The task requires human interaction, negotiation skills, and relationship-building, which are not areas where the LLM can significantly contribute. Therefore, the task does not involve writing or transforming text, providing edits, summarizing documents, or any other text-based activities that the LLM excels at. As a result, the task falls under E0 as it does not clearly benefit from the capabilities of the LLM.

2: E0
