1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of overseeing or providing expertise on manufacturing, assembly, or fabrication processes as a Photonics Engineer, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be aided by the use of a large language model (LLM).

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** If the task involves writing reports, documenting processes, providing feedback on manufacturing procedures, or communicating with team members through written correspondence, the LLM could significantly reduce the time needed to complete these tasks. The LLM could assist in generating detailed reports, summarizing data, or even drafting emails related to the manufacturing processes.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the LLM alone may not directly reduce the time to complete the task by half, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to provide recommendations based on data analysis, suggest improvements to manufacturing processes, or even retrieve up-to-date information on new fabrication techniques.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Since the task does not involve detailed visuals or require image processing, the use of image capabilities provided by the LLM would not significantly impact the completion time of overseeing manufacturing processes in photonics engineering.
