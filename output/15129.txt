1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of reviewing project plans to plan and coordinate project activity for Computer and Information Systems Managers, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it more efficiently.

- E1: Direct exposure - The task involves reviewing project plans, which may require analyzing and understanding complex information. The LLM could assist in summarizing project plans, providing insights or recommendations based on the content of the plans, or even generating reports based on the information in the plans. This direct access to the LLM could significantly reduce the time it takes to review project plans effectively.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone could help with tasks like summarizing project plans or providing insights, additional software built on top of the LLM could further enhance the efficiency of coordinating project activities. For example, a specialized project management tool that integrates with the LLM could automate certain aspects of project coordination based on the information extracted from project plans.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Since the task does not involve working with images or require image analysis, the image capabilities of the LLM would not significantly impact the completion of this task.
