1: In this task, a carpenter is responsible for installing rough door and window frames, subflooring, fixtures, or temporary supports in structures undergoing construction or repair. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. This task involves physical construction work that requires hands-on skills, precision in measurements, and the ability to work with various materials. The task does not involve text-based inputs or outputs that can be easily processed by an LLM. Additionally, the task requires physical interaction with the construction materials and the structure being worked on, which cannot be replaced by text-based processing alone. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM or any tools built on top of it.
