1: In this task, a Transportation Inspector is required to determine the types of licenses and safety equipment needed for transportation operations, as well as calculate applicable fees like tolls and wharfage fees. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could assist in completing it.

- **E0**: This task involves a high level of specificity and domain knowledge related to transportation regulations, licenses, safety equipment, and fee structures. The task also requires practical understanding of the transportation industry, which may not be effectively addressed by the LLM alone. The task involves specific calculations and legal requirements that may not be easily automated by the LLM.

- **E1**: The LLM could potentially assist in providing general information about transportation regulations, license types, safety equipment standards, and fee structures. It could help in summarizing relevant guidelines or regulations, which could aid the inspector in making decisions. However, the task involves specific calculations and legal requirements that may require more specialized tools or software beyond the capabilities of the LLM alone.

- **E2**: While the LLM could provide general information and guidelines related to licenses, safety equipment, and fee structures, additional software could be developed to automate the process of determining specific license requirements, safety equipment standards, and fee calculations. This software could integrate with the LLM to retrieve up-to-date information and provide more tailored recommendations based on the input provided by the inspector.

- **E3**: The task does not involve image processing or detailed visual analysis, so exposure to image capabilities would not significantly impact the completion of the task.
