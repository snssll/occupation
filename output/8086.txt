1: In this task, the Continuous Mining Machine Operators are responsible for installing casings to prevent cave-ins during mining operations. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the complexity of the task and whether the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete it with equivalent quality.

Continuous Mining Machine Operators require hands-on skills and physical presence to operate machinery and install casings in mining environments. This task involves precise measurements, physical labor, and real-time decision-making based on the conditions in the mine. The task does not involve text-based instructions or data analysis that can be easily automated by the LLM.

Given that the task requires physical presence, precise measurements, and real-time decision-making, it is unlikely that the LLM or any tool built on top of it can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete the task. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not benefit from LLM exposure.
