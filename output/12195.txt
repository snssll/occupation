1: In this task, a Tire Builder is responsible for positioning rollers to turn ply edges under and over beads or using steel rods to turn ply edges. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the complexity and nature of the task. 

- This task involves a specific set of actions that are well-defined and do not require complex decision-making or analysis.
- The task description is clear and does not involve subjective interpretation or creative input.
- The task does not require accessing up-to-date information or specialized domain knowledge beyond the scope of the task itself.
- The task does not involve any visual or image processing requirements.

Based on these considerations, the task of positioning rollers or using steel rods in tire building does not significantly benefit from the capabilities of an LLM. The task is straightforward and mechanical in nature, without requiring advanced language processing or decision-making skills that an LLM could enhance. Therefore, this task falls under the E0 category.
