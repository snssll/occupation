1: In this task, a Meeting, Convention, and Event Planner is responsible for coordinating various services for events. This involves managing accommodation, transportation, facilities, catering, signage, displays, special needs requirements, printing, and event security. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if access to the LLM or LLM-powered tools can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality.

- E0: This task involves a high degree of human interaction and coordination of physical services, which cannot be effectively replaced by the LLM alone. The task also requires real-time decision-making and on-the-ground management, which the LLM cannot perform.

- E1: While the LLM could potentially assist in drafting emails, summarizing information, or providing recommendations for event planning based on general knowledge, it cannot directly coordinate services like accommodation, transportation, catering, and event security, which are crucial aspects of this task.

- E2: It is conceivable that additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to help with aspects of event planning, such as summarizing detailed event requirements, retrieving information on venues or services, or providing recommendations based on data analysis. However, the core coordination of services for events would still require human oversight and interaction.

- E3: The task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images, so the image capabilities of the LLM are not directly relevant to this task.

2: E0

3: Certainty level: High
