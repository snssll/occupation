1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of processing and reviewing employment applications as a Human Resources Assistant, I will consider the capabilities of the OpenAI large language model (LLM). The task involves reviewing text-based information (employment applications) to evaluate qualifications or eligibility of applicants. The LLM can assist in tasks such as providing edits to existing text, summarizing documents, answering questions about documents, and maintaining records of written data. In this case, the LLM can help in processing and reviewing employment applications by providing edits, summarizing key points from applications, answering questions about specific qualifications, and maintaining records of applicant information. While the LLM alone may not reduce the time to complete the task by half, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to automate parts of the application review process, making it more efficient.
