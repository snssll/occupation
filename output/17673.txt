1: In this task, a Special Education Teacher is required to visit schools to tutor students with sensory impairments and consult with teachers regarding students' special needs. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves interacting with students and teachers in person, providing hands-on support, and assessing the needs of students with sensory impairments. This task requires physical presence, observation, and direct interaction, which cannot be effectively replaced by the capabilities of an LLM. The LLM cannot provide the necessary physical support, observe students' behaviors, or assess their needs in a hands-on manner. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it cannot be significantly aided by the LLM or any tools built on top of it.
