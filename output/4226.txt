1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of demonstrating and selling hair care products and cosmetics as a Hairdresser, Hairstylist, and Cosmetologist, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it could potentially be impacted by the use of a large language model (LLM).

- E0: This task involves direct human interaction and demonstration of products to customers. It requires physical presence, communication skills, and the ability to assess customer needs in real-time. An LLM cannot replace the hands-on demonstration and personalized interaction required for selling products in a salon setting.

- E1: While an LLM could potentially assist in creating marketing materials, product descriptions, or online content related to the hair care products and cosmetics, the core task of demonstrating and selling products would still heavily rely on in-person interaction and practical demonstration. The LLM could help with writing promotional materials or product information, but it cannot replace the essential human element of sales in this context.

- E2: It is conceivable that additional software could be developed on top of an LLM to automate certain aspects of product promotion, such as generating personalized product recommendations based on customer preferences or analyzing sales data to optimize product offerings. However, the fundamental task of demonstrating and selling products would still require human intervention and interaction.

- E3: The task of demonstrating and selling hair care products and cosmetics does not involve image processing or analysis that would significantly benefit from additional image capabilities. The core of the task lies in interpersonal communication and sales skills rather than visual or image-related tasks.
