1: In this task, a nanny is required to transport children to various locations such as schools, social outings, and medical appointments. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves physical transportation of children, which cannot be directly assisted by the LLM. The LLM cannot drive a vehicle or physically transport children. Additionally, the task does not involve complex data analysis, specialized knowledge retrieval, or document summarization that could be significantly aided by the LLM. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not benefit from the capabilities of the LLM.
