1: In this task, an Airfield Operations Specialist is responsible for posting visual display boards and status boards at an airfield. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone or with additional software could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality.

- E0: This task involves physical work that cannot be automated by the LLM or any software tool. It requires the specialist to physically post the boards, which cannot be done through text-based instructions or automation.
- E1: While the LLM could potentially provide guidance on what information should be included on the boards or how to format them, the actual task of physically posting the boards cannot be completed through text-based instructions alone. Therefore, the time it takes to complete this task would not be significantly reduced by access to the LLM.
- E2: It is conceivable that additional software could be developed to assist in creating the content for the boards or organizing the information to be displayed. However, the physical act of posting the boards would still require human intervention, so the time savings would not be substantial.
- E3: The task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images, so the image capabilities of the LLM would not significantly impact the completion time of this task.

Based on the analysis above, the most appropriate exposure label for this task is E0.

2: E0

3: High
