1: In this task, a tutor is required to participate in training and development sessions to enhance their tutoring skills. With access to the LLM, the tutor could potentially use the model to research and gather information on the latest tutoring practices, techniques, and trends. The LLM could assist in summarizing relevant documents, providing feedback on training materials, generating questions for discussions, or even helping in preparing training materials based on general knowledge. However, the task primarily involves active participation in training sessions, which may not be directly impacted by the LLM's capabilities. While the LLM could provide supplementary information and support, the core aspect of attending and engaging in training sessions remains a human-centric activity.
