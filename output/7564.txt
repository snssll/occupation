1: In this task, an Ophthalmic Laboratory Technician is required to immerse eyeglass frames in solutions to harden, soften, or dye frames. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. This task involves physical manipulation of eyeglass frames and requires hands-on work that cannot be directly performed by an LLM. The task does not involve text input or output, complex instructions, data analysis, or decision-making based on information that an LLM can provide. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM or any tools built on top of it.
