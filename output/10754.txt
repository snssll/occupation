1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of operating disc jockey equipment, such as controllers and microphones, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves physical interaction with equipment, which cannot be directly replaced by text-based interactions with the LLM. The LLM does not have the ability to physically operate equipment or interact with the physical world. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not involve text-based interactions that the LLM can assist with.
