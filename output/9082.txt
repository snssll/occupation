1: In this task, a Teaching Assistant is responsible for maintaining computers in classrooms and laboratories, as well as assisting students with hardware and software use. With the help of the LLM, the TA could potentially receive guidance on troubleshooting common computer issues, finding resources for software updates, or even generating instructional materials for students on how to use specific software programs. The LLM could also assist in creating documentation for computer maintenance procedures. However, since the task involves physical interaction with computers and students, as well as hands-on technical support, the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task. While the LLM could provide some guidance and resources, the hands-on nature of the task may limit the direct impact of the LLM.
