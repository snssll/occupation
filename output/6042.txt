1: In this task, a Healthcare Social Worker is required to educate clients about end-of-life symptoms and options to assist them in making informed decisions. To complete this task, the worker needs to have a deep understanding of medical terminology, end-of-life care options, and the ability to communicate complex information in a sensitive and empathetic manner. The task involves providing detailed information, answering questions, and guiding clients through difficult decisions.

Considering the task requirements, the most suitable exposure label from the rubric would be E0. This task involves a high degree of human interaction, empathy, and nuanced communication skills that cannot be effectively replaced by an LLM. The task also requires the worker to tailor information to the specific needs and emotional state of each client, which goes beyond the capabilities of current AI systems.
