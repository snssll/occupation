1: In this task, a courier or messenger is required to perform routine maintenance on delivery vehicles, such as monitoring fluid levels and replenishing fuel. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone or with additional software could significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality.

- E0: This task involves physical actions like monitoring fluid levels and replenishing fuel, which cannot be directly assisted by the LLM or any software built on top of it. The task also does not involve complex decision-making that could be automated by the LLM.

- E1: The LLM could potentially provide information on best practices for vehicle maintenance, reminders for routine checks, or guidelines for monitoring fluid levels. However, the actual physical act of performing maintenance tasks like replenishing fuel cannot be directly assisted by the LLM. While the LLM could provide some information, it would not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task.

- E2: It is conceivable that additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to create a maintenance schedule for vehicles, track fluid levels remotely, or provide real-time alerts for maintenance needs. This software could potentially streamline the maintenance process and improve efficiency, but as of now, the LLM alone does not offer a substantial advantage in completing this task.

- E3: The task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images, so the image capabilities of the LLM are not relevant in this context.

2: E0
