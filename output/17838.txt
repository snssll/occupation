1: In this task, a Database Architect is required to write and code logical and physical database descriptions, as well as specify identifiers of the database to the management system or direct others in coding descriptions. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The LLM can assist in writing and transforming text and code according to complex instructions. It can also help in providing edits to existing text or code following specifications. However, the task of writing logical and physical database descriptions involves specialized domain knowledge that may not be within the scope of the general capabilities of the LLM. While the LLM can assist in generating text based on provided information, the task of specifying identifiers of databases and directing others in coding descriptions may require highly specialized domain knowledge that goes beyond the capabilities of the LLM.
