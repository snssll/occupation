1: In this task, a Gem and Diamond Worker is required to split gems along pre-marked lines to remove imperfections using blades and jewelers' hammers. This task involves physical manipulation of gems and requires precision and skill. The task does not involve any text input or output, and the context is primarily focused on the physical action of splitting gems. Since the task does not involve any text-based processing or analysis that could benefit from the capabilities of an LLM, it does not fall under E1, E2, or E3 exposure levels. Therefore, this task would be classified as E0 as it does not align with the criteria for exposure to LLM capabilities.

2: E0

3: High
