1: In this task, the Food Preparation Worker is required to operate a cash register, handle money, and give correct change. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves basic arithmetic calculations, handling physical money, and interacting with customers. These aspects do not directly align with the capabilities of the LLM, as it does not have the ability to physically handle money or interact with customers in a real-world setting. While the LLM could potentially provide guidance on how to give correct change or offer tips on operating a cash register, the practical aspects of handling physical money and interacting with customers are beyond its capabilities. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not significantly benefit from the use of the LLM.
