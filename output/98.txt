1: In this task, a Rolling Machine Setter, Operator, or Tender for Metal and Plastic needs to adjust and correct machine set-ups to reduce thicknesses, reshape products, and eliminate product defects. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if the task can be completed more efficiently with the help of an LLM. Since this task involves physical adjustments to machinery and requires hands-on work with equipment, it does not align with the capabilities of an LLM. The LLM cannot physically interact with machinery or perform tasks that require precise measurements or physical adjustments. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not benefit from the use of an LLM.

2: E0
