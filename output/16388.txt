1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of studying the nutritional requirements of animals and the nutritive values of animal feed materials as an Animal Scientist, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be aided by the use of a large language model (LLM) like OpenAI's model.

- Animal Scientists typically engage in research, data analysis, and documentation related to animal nutrition. They may need to access and review scientific literature, conduct experiments, and analyze data to understand the nutritional needs of different animals.
- With access to an LLM, an Animal Scientist could potentially use the model to assist in summarizing research papers, generating reports, answering specific questions related to animal nutrition, and even staying up-to-date with the latest research findings in the field.
- The LLM could help in quickly retrieving information on specific animal feed materials, their nutritive values, and any recent advancements in animal nutrition science.
- While the LLM may not directly reduce the time it takes to conduct experiments or analyze complex data sets, it can significantly aid in the information retrieval, summarization, and knowledge synthesis aspects of the task.

Based on these considerations, the task of studying the nutritional requirements of animals and nutritive values of animal feed materials as an Animal Scientist would likely fall under label E1 - Direct exposure.

2: E1
