1: In this task, the occupation of Carpenters involves installing structures or fixtures using hand or power tools. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes for a carpenter to complete this task with high quality. Carpenters primarily work with physical tools and materials, and the task involves hands-on work that cannot be directly replaced by text-based instructions or information provided by the LLM. The LLM cannot physically install structures or fixtures, and the task requires precise measurements and physical labor, which are not within the capabilities of the LLM. Therefore, the task does not align with the capabilities of the LLM or any tools built on top of it, leading to the conclusion that this task falls under E0.

2: E0

3: High
