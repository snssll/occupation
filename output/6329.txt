1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of estimating set- or exhibit-related costs for Set and Exhibit Designers, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be impacted by the use of the LLM. 

- The task involves estimating costs related to materials, construction, and rental of props or locations. This task primarily requires knowledge of pricing, materials, and construction methods in the context of set and exhibit design.
- The LLM could potentially assist in providing information on current market prices for materials, rental costs, and possibly even suggest cost-saving strategies based on general knowledge.
- While the LLM could help with providing some information, the task itself heavily relies on specific domain knowledge related to set and exhibit design, which may not be easily accessible to the LLM.
- The LLM may not significantly reduce the time it takes to estimate costs compared to a skilled human with domain expertise in set and exhibit design.
