1: In this task, "Assist in the preparation of book displays," a Library Assistant, Clerical would typically be responsible for organizing and setting up book displays in the library. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it could potentially benefit from the use of a large language model (LLM) like OpenAI's model.

- E0: This task involves physical work such as arranging books and setting up displays, which cannot be directly assisted by an LLM. The task does not involve complex data analysis, decision-making, or information retrieval that would significantly benefit from LLM capabilities.

- E1: While an LLM could potentially assist in generating text for signage or display descriptions, the core task of physically setting up book displays would not be significantly expedited by the use of an LLM. The task is more hands-on and practical in nature, requiring physical manipulation of objects rather than text generation.

- E2: It is conceivable that an application could be developed to suggest creative ideas for book displays based on popular themes, genres, or new releases using an LLM. This could potentially streamline the brainstorming process for creating engaging displays. However, the actual physical setup of the displays would still require manual labor.

- E3: The task of "Assist in the preparation of book displays" does not involve image processing, detailed visual analysis, or the creation of digital images. Therefore, the use of image capabilities alongside an LLM would not significantly impact the completion of this task.
