1: In this task, a Web Administrator is responsible for monitoring systems for intrusions or denial of service attacks and reporting security breaches to the appropriate personnel. To determine the exposure label for this task in relation to the LLM, we can break it down as follows:

- **Direct exposure (E1):** The task involves monitoring systems for security breaches and reporting them, which can be done through written communication. The LLM can assist in drafting reports, analyzing potential security threats, and providing guidance on how to respond to breaches. The LLM can help in summarizing security logs, generating incident reports, and even suggesting best practices for handling security incidents. Therefore, the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality.

- **Exposure by LLM-powered applications (E2):** While the LLM alone can assist in various aspects of this task, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to further enhance the monitoring capabilities. For example, an application that integrates with security monitoring tools to provide real-time analysis and alerts based on LLM-generated insights could streamline the process even more. This additional software could potentially reduce the time it takes to complete the task by half.

- **Exposure given image capabilities (E3):** Image capabilities are not directly relevant to monitoring systems for security breaches and reporting them. This task primarily involves text-based monitoring and reporting activities, making image capabilities less impactful in this context.

Based on the above analysis, the most suitable exposure label for this task is **E1 (Direct exposure)**.

2: E1

3: Certainty level: High
