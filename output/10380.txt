1: In this task, an etcher or engraver is required to neutralize workpieces to remove acid, wax, or enamel using various methods such as water, solvents, brushes, or specialized machines. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task and how an LLM could potentially assist in completing it. 

- E0: This task involves physical work that cannot be automated by an LLM. It requires hands-on manipulation of workpieces and specialized tools, which cannot be performed by a language model.
- E1: While the task involves specific instructions for neutralizing workpieces, the physical aspect of using water, solvents, brushes, and machines cannot be directly replaced by an LLM. The LLM may provide information on the chemical properties of the substances used or general guidance, but it cannot physically neutralize the workpieces.
- E2: An LLM-powered application could potentially provide guidance on the best practices for neutralizing workpieces based on chemical properties, safety precautions, or specific techniques. It could also offer recommendations on the most effective solvents or methods to use. However, the physical act of neutralizing the workpieces would still require human intervention.
- E3: This task does not involve image processing or detailed visual instructions that would benefit from image capabilities. Therefore, the use of image capabilities would not significantly impact the completion of this task.
