1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of creating habitat management or restoration plans as an Environmental Restoration Planner, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be aided by the use of the LLM. 

- The task involves creating plans for habitat management and restoration, which requires knowledge of ecological principles, species interactions, and environmental regulations.
- The LLM can assist in providing information on best practices for habitat restoration, examples of successful restoration projects, and potential challenges in weed control.
- The LLM can help generate text for the plans, outline steps for restoration, and suggest strategies for native tree restoration.
- The LLM can also assist in researching specific species, their habitat requirements, and effective weed control methods.

Based on these considerations, the task can benefit significantly from the LLM's ability to provide relevant information, generate text, and assist in research related to habitat management and restoration plans. Therefore, the task falls under label E1 - Direct exposure.
