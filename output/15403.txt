1: In this task, a Real Estate Sales Agent is responsible for securing construction or purchase financing with their own firm or a mortgage company. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves financial transactions and negotiations related to real estate financing. The LLM could potentially assist in providing information on different financing options, explaining terms and processes, drafting communication materials, or even generating responses to common inquiries related to financing. However, the task also involves complex financial regulations, legal considerations, and potentially sensitive client information, which may require human judgment and expertise. While the LLM can provide general information and support, it may not have the specialized knowledge or decision-making capabilities required for this task. Therefore, I would classify this task as E2, as additional software could be developed to enhance the LLM's capabilities in providing recommendations, analyzing financial data, or offering insights into specific financing scenarios.
