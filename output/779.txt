1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of applying caulk, sealants, or other agents to installed surfaces as a Helper in the masonry and tile setting field, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be aided by the use of a large language model (LLM).

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** If the task involves complex instructions, such as specific types of caulk or sealants to be used in different scenarios, the LLM could assist in providing detailed information on the best practices for application. The LLM could generate text on the proper techniques, safety precautions, and potential issues to watch out for during the application process.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the task itself is relatively straightforward, additional software built on top of the LLM could potentially provide real-time guidance based on the specific surface material, environmental conditions, or type of caulk/sealant being used. This software could analyze the input data and provide tailored recommendations for the application process.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** In this case, image capabilities may not significantly enhance the task of applying caulk, sealants, or other agents to installed surfaces. The task primarily involves manual labor and does not heavily rely on visual or image-based information that an LLM with image capabilities could assist with.
