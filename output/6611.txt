1: In this task, an Insurance Appraiser, Auto Damage needs to examine a damaged vehicle to determine the extent of various types of damage. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we can break down the task:
- The task involves visual inspection and assessment of a damaged vehicle, which requires expertise in auto mechanics and structural analysis.
- The task does not involve text input or output, and the context is primarily visual and hands-on.
- The task requires physical presence to examine the vehicle and make accurate assessments based on direct observation.
- The task does not involve writing, summarizing documents, or generating text output.

Based on these considerations, the task does not align with any of the exposure levels in the rubric. The task is primarily hands-on, requires physical inspection, and involves expertise in auto mechanics, which cannot be effectively replaced or significantly aided by an LLM.
