1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of scheduling hearings for Administrative Law Judges, Adjudicators, and Hearing Officers, we need to consider how the task can be completed with the help of an LLM.

- E1: Direct exposure - The task of scheduling hearings involves organizing and managing appointments, which can be facilitated by the LLM through generating schedules, reminders, and notifications based on input criteria such as availability, case priority, and location. The LLM can assist in drafting communication to inform parties involved about the scheduled hearings.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time it takes to schedule hearings, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to streamline the process. This software could integrate with calendars, case management systems, and communication tools to automate scheduling based on predefined rules and criteria.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not relevant for the task of scheduling hearings as it primarily involves text-based information and communication, without the need for image processing.

Based on the above analysis, the task of scheduling hearings for Administrative Law Judges, Adjudicators, and Hearing Officers aligns most closely with E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications.
