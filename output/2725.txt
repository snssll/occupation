1: In this task, the Online Merchants are required to compose images of products using various equipment and software. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if the task can be significantly expedited or improved by the use of an LLM. 

- E0: This task involves physical actions such as using cameras, lighting equipment, and props, which cannot be directly assisted by an LLM. The task also requires visual creativity and technical skills that are not within the capabilities of the LLM.

- E3: While the LLM cannot directly interact with images or video, if there were a system that could view, caption, and create images based on text input, it could potentially assist in generating ideas for product compositions. However, this system cannot take video as input, limiting its direct applicability to this task.

Considering the limitations of the LLM in interacting with images and videos, as well as the physical nature of the task, it is more appropriate to classify this task as E0.

2: E0

3: Moderate
