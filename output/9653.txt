1: In this task, a Septic Tank Servicer and Sewer Pipe Cleaner is required to measure excavation sites within sewers using tools like plumbers' snakes, tapelines, or cutting heads, and mark areas for digging. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality.

- E0: This task involves physical measurements within sewers, which cannot be done by the LLM or any software tool. The task also requires on-site presence and manual work, making it unsuitable for automation by the LLM.

- E1: The LLM cannot physically measure excavation sites or mark areas for digging. While it can provide information on techniques or safety measures related to the task, it cannot directly perform the measurements required.

- E2: Although the LLM could potentially provide information on best practices for measuring excavation sites or safety guidelines, it cannot directly measure or mark areas for digging. However, additional software could be developed to provide guidance or instructions based on the input data provided by the worker.

- E3: The task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images. Therefore, the image capabilities of the LLM are not relevant to this task.

Based on the above analysis, the most appropriate exposure label for this task is E0.

2: E0

3: High
