1: In this task, a glazier is responsible for preparing surfaces for mirror installation by cutting and attaching various materials like mounting strips, moldings, gaskets, and clips. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the complexity of the task and whether the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete it with equivalent quality.

- The task involves physical work such as cutting and attaching materials to surfaces, which cannot be directly performed by the LLM.
- The task requires hands-on skills and precision in working with materials, which are not within the capabilities of the LLM.
- The LLM does not have the ability to interact with physical objects or perform tasks that require physical manipulation.
- While the LLM could potentially provide information on techniques or best practices for mirror installation, it cannot directly assist in the hands-on aspects of the task.

Based on these considerations, the task of cutting and attaching materials for mirror installation by glaziers would be classified as E0 since the LLM cannot significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete the task with high quality.

2: E0

3: High
