1: In this task, a sheet metal worker is required to trim, file, grind, deburr, buff, or smooth surfaces, seams, or joints of assembled parts using hand tools or portable power tools. This task involves manual labor and physical manipulation of materials, which cannot be directly performed by an LLM. The task does not involve text input or output, and the expertise required is in the physical domain rather than the cognitive domain. Therefore, the task does not align with the capabilities of the LLM, and there is no way for the LLM to significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task.
