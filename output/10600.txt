1: Morticians, undertakers, and funeral arrangers often need to obtain specific information to complete legal documents such as death certificates or burial permits. With access to the powerful OpenAI large language model (LLM), these professionals could potentially streamline the process of gathering this information by quickly searching for relevant details, regulations, and requirements. The LLM could assist in summarizing complex legal jargon, providing templates for legal documents, and suggesting key information needed for different types of certificates or permits. This would significantly reduce the time and effort required to complete this task, making it more efficient and accurate.

Considering the nature of the task and the capabilities of the LLM, it falls under the category of E1 - Direct exposure. The LLM can assist in writing and transforming text according to complex instructions, providing edits to existing text following specifications, and maintaining records of written data, all of which are essential for completing legal documents accurately and efficiently.
