1: In this task, a surveyor is required to prepare and maintain sketches, maps, reports, and legal descriptions of surveys. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves a significant amount of text-based work, such as preparing reports and legal descriptions.
- The task requires organizing and structuring information in a clear and concise manner.
- The task involves documenting and certifying survey work performed.

Given that the task primarily involves working with text-based information and organizing data, it is likely that access to the LLM could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task by assisting in generating reports, legal descriptions, and possibly even sketches based on the input data provided.
