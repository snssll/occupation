1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of maintaining inventory and ordering materials as required for the occupation of Farmworkers and Laborers, Crop, Nursery, and Greenhouse, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be supported by the capabilities of the LLM.

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** The task involves managing inventory and ordering materials, which can be largely text-based. The LLM can assist in generating inventory lists, tracking materials, and even drafting orders based on specified criteria. The model can help in organizing and summarizing inventory data, suggesting reorder points, and generating order forms. This direct text-based support can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the LLM can directly assist in text-based tasks related to inventory management and ordering, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to enhance its capabilities further. For example, specialized applications could be created to integrate with inventory management systems, automate ordering processes based on predefined rules, or provide real-time updates on material availability and pricing. These applications could streamline the task even more, although the base LLM alone is already quite effective.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** This task does not involve image processing or detailed visual analysis, so the image capabilities of the LLM are not directly relevant here.
