1: In this task, a Social and Community Service Manager is responsible for direct fundraising activities and preparing public relations materials. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality. 

Direct exposure (E1) could apply if the LLM can assist in writing fundraising proposals, drafting public relations materials, or generating ideas for fundraising campaigns. The LLM could help in crafting persuasive language, providing examples of successful fundraising strategies, or suggesting effective communication strategies for public relations.

Exposure by LLM-powered applications (E2) might be relevant if there were specialized software developed on top of the LLM that could analyze fundraising data, recommend fundraising tactics based on trends, or generate detailed reports on public relations performance. This additional software could enhance the manager's decision-making process and streamline the creation of materials.

Given image capabilities (E3) would not be applicable in this task as it primarily involves text-based activities like writing fundraising proposals and public relations materials. Image capabilities would not significantly impact the completion of these tasks.
