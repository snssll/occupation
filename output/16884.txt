1: In this task, a Weatherization Installer or Technician is required to test and diagnose air flow systems using furnace efficiency analysis equipment. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves technical knowledge related to HVAC systems and equipment, as well as the ability to analyze data from furnace efficiency analysis equipment. While the LLM can provide general information on HVAC systems and equipment, it may not have the specific domain knowledge required to effectively test and diagnose air flow systems using specialized equipment. Additionally, the task involves hands-on work with physical equipment, which is not something the LLM can assist with directly. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not significantly benefit from the capabilities of the LLM.
