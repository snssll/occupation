1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of making minor repairs to a vehicle and changing tires as a Bus Driver, Transit and Intercity, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves physical actions such as repairing vehicles and changing tires, which cannot be directly performed by the LLM or any software tool built on top of it. The task also does not involve text-based instructions or information retrieval that could benefit from the LLM's language processing abilities. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM or any potential software applications that could be developed on top of it.

2: E0

3: High
