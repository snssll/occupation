1: In this task, a nursing assistant is required to undress, wash, and dress patients who are unable to do so for themselves. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves physical interaction with patients, which cannot be performed by an LLM or any software tool. The task requires hands-on care and assistance, which is beyond the capabilities of text-based language models. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it cannot be completed or significantly aided by an LLM.
