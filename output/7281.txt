1: In this task, a Drywall and Ceiling Tile Installer is required to hang dry lines to wall moldings to guide the positioning of main runners. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. Hanging dry lines involves physical work and precise measurements, which cannot be directly assisted by an LLM. The task requires manual labor and expertise in construction techniques, which are beyond the capabilities of the LLM. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not involve text input or output that can be significantly aided by the LLM.
