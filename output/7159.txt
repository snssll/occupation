1: In this task, a Clinical Data Manager is required to generate data queries to resolve validation checks, errors, and omissions in the data entry process. With the help of the most powerful OpenAI large language model (LLM), the task can be significantly expedited. The LLM can assist in generating data queries based on the identified problems, providing suggestions, and even drafting the queries themselves. The model can understand the context of the data entry process, common validation checks, and potential errors and omissions, making it easier for the Clinical Data Manager to address these issues efficiently.

Considering the capabilities of the LLM to understand and generate text based on complex instructions, provide edits following specifications, and assist in data-related tasks, this task falls under the E1 category. Direct access to the LLM can reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality by at least half.
