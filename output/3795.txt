1: In this task, an Advertising and Promotions Manager is required to coordinate with various team members to develop and implement marketing programs. This task involves a significant amount of communication, collaboration, and decision-making based on the input from different stakeholders. While an LLM could potentially assist in generating written content for marketing programs or providing suggestions for marketing strategies, it may not significantly reduce the time it takes to coordinate with team members and make collaborative decisions. The task also involves a level of human interaction and decision-making that may not be easily automated by an LLM alone. Therefore, I would consider this task as having no exposure to LLM (E0).

2: E0

3: Moderate
