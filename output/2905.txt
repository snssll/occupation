1: In this task, a Petroleum Pump System Operator, Refinery Operator, or Gauger is required to conduct general housekeeping of units, which includes wiping up oil spills and performing general cleaning duties. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- Direct exposure (E1): The task of conducting general housekeeping and cleaning duties involves straightforward instructions that can be easily communicated to the LLM. The LLM can generate text describing the steps involved in cleaning up oil spills and performing general cleaning tasks. It can also provide information on best practices for housekeeping in industrial settings. Therefore, this task can be completed with the help of the LLM, reducing the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality.

- Exposure by LLM-powered applications (E2): While the LLM can assist in providing instructions and information related to general housekeeping tasks, there may not be a specific software application that significantly enhances the completion of this task beyond what the LLM can already do. The task does not involve complex data analysis, specialized domain knowledge, or decision-making that would require additional software capabilities. 

- Exposure given image capabilities (E3): This task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images. The task is primarily focused on conducting physical cleaning and housekeeping duties in an industrial setting, which can be effectively addressed through text-based instructions and information provided by the LLM.

Based on the above analysis, the most appropriate label for this task is E1 - Direct exposure.

2: E1

3: High
