1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of applying engineering principles to emerging fields as a Mechanical Engineer, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be facilitated by the use of the LLM.

- Mechanical Engineers typically require a strong foundation in engineering principles and practices, which may involve complex problem-solving, analysis, and design.
- The task of applying these principles to emerging fields like robotics, waste management, or biomedical engineering may involve researching new technologies, understanding specific industry requirements, and developing innovative solutions.
- The LLM can assist in providing information on current trends, recent advancements, and theoretical concepts related to these emerging fields.
- The LLM can help in generating ideas, summarizing research findings, and even proposing potential solutions based on the input provided.
- While the LLM can be a valuable tool for gathering information and generating initial concepts, the actual implementation and detailed engineering work would still require the expertise and experience of a Mechanical Engineer.

Based on these considerations, the task of applying engineering principles to emerging fields as a Mechanical Engineer would likely fall under **E2 - Exposure by LLM-powered applications**. While the LLM can provide valuable insights and information to support the engineer's work, it may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task by half on its own.
