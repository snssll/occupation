1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of writing reports or articles related to environmental engineering issues, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves writing text content, which is well within the capabilities of the LLM. The LLM can assist in generating high-quality written content based on input instructions and information provided. In this case, the LLM can help with tasks such as summarizing technical information, providing insights, and structuring the content effectively. Since the task primarily involves text-based work and does not require specialized domain knowledge beyond what the LLM can provide, it is likely that direct access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality. Therefore, the task falls under label E1.
