1: In this task, the Appraisers and Assessors of Real Estate are required to inspect properties and consider various factors to determine the appraisal value. To complete this task, the appraiser needs to have a good understanding of real estate markets, property values, and factors that influence property prices. The LLM could potentially assist by providing information on current market trends, property values in specific locations, and factors affecting property values. The LLM could also help in generating reports or summaries based on the data provided by the appraiser during property inspections. However, the task of physically inspecting properties, assessing their condition, and interacting with clients or property owners cannot be done by the LLM. Therefore, while the LLM can provide some support in terms of data analysis and report generation, it cannot replace the core functions of an appraiser in physically inspecting properties and interacting with stakeholders.
