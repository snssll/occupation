1: In this task, a surgical assistant is responsible for covering patients with surgical drapes to create and maintain a sterile operative field. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. This task involves physical interaction with patients and requires manual dexterity to ensure the sterile field is maintained. It does not involve writing, summarizing documents, analyzing text, or any other activity that can be directly assisted by an LLM. The task is hands-on and cannot be completed using text-based tools or software. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM or any software built on top of it.
