1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of clearing jams in sorting equipment for Postal Service Mail Sorters, Processors, and Processing Machine Operators, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. In this task, the worker needs to physically interact with the sorting equipment to remove jams, which cannot be done through text input and output alone. The task involves hands-on work that cannot be automated by the LLM or any software built on top of it. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not benefit from the use of the LLM or any LLM-powered tools.
