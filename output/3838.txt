1: In this task, a healthcare social worker is required to counsel clients and patients in individual and group sessions to help them overcome dependencies, recover from illness, and adjust to life. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves providing counseling services, which heavily relies on human interaction, empathy, and understanding of individual needs. While an LLM could potentially assist in providing general information or guidelines on counseling techniques, the core aspect of counseling, which involves building rapport, active listening, and providing personalized support, is highly human-centric and requires emotional intelligence. Therefore, the task does not seem to benefit significantly from LLM capabilities, as the essence of counseling lies in the human touch and personalized approach.
