1: In this task, a cook in a restaurant is required to carve and trim meats for various services. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be significantly expedited or improved by using the language model. Since this task involves physical actions such as carving and trimming meats, which cannot be directly assisted by the LLM, it is unlikely that the model can reduce the time it takes to complete the task with high quality by at least half. The task does not involve text input or output that can be easily processed by the LLM. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM.

2: E0

3: High
