1: In this task, an Electrical and Electronics Repairer working on powerhouses, substations, and relays needs to open and close switches to isolate defective relays and perform adjustments or repairs. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be significantly aided by text-based information processing, such as accessing repair manuals, troubleshooting guides, or technical documentation. Since the task involves technical knowledge and hands-on work, it is unlikely that the LLM alone can reduce the time it takes to complete the task by at least half. While the LLM could potentially provide some general information on electrical systems, it may not have the specific expertise required for this specialized task.
