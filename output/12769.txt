1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of preparing sales contracts and order forms for Sales Representatives, Wholesale and Manufacturing, Except Technical and Scientific Products, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it.

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** The task of preparing sales contracts and order forms involves writing and transforming text according to specific instructions. The LLM can assist in generating text based on provided information, such as terms and conditions, pricing details, and product descriptions. The model can help streamline the process by providing accurate and detailed content for the contracts and forms.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the LLM can be helpful in generating text for contracts and forms, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to further enhance the process. For example, specialized software could be created to automatically populate contract templates with relevant information based on input provided by the user, making the task even more efficient.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Image capabilities would not significantly impact the task of preparing sales contracts and order forms, as it primarily involves text-based content creation. Therefore, this task does not fall under E3.

Based on the analysis above, the task of preparing sales contracts and order forms for Sales Representatives, Wholesale and Manufacturing, Except Technical and Scientific Products, aligns best with **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications)** as additional software could be developed to further streamline the process.
