1: In this task, a Craft Artist is required to select materials based on various characteristics such as strength, color, texture, balance, weight, size, malleability, and other features. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone or with additional software could significantly reduce the time it takes for a Craft Artist to complete this task with equivalent quality.

- E0: This task involves physical interaction and sensory evaluation of materials, which cannot be replaced by text-based tools like the LLM. The nuances of material selection, such as tactile feedback, visual inspection, and physical properties, require human judgment and expertise that cannot be replicated by the LLM.

- E1: While the LLM could potentially provide information on the characteristics of materials based on text input, it cannot replace the hands-on experience and sensory evaluation needed for material selection. The task involves a high degree of human judgment and interaction with physical objects, making it unsuitable for significant automation by the LLM alone.

- E2: It is conceivable that specialized software could be developed to assist Craft Artists in material selection by providing recommendations based on specific criteria input by the artist. This software could potentially analyze vast amounts of data on materials and their properties to aid in decision-making. However, the complex nature of material selection and the need for physical interaction still limit the extent to which the LLM alone can reduce the time for this task by half.

- E3: The task of selecting materials for use based on various characteristics involves physical attributes that cannot be accurately assessed through text-based or image capabilities alone. The LLM's text-based capabilities and image recognition are not sufficient to replace the tactile and visual assessment required for material selection by Craft Artists.
