1: In this task, a Software Quality Assurance Analyst and Tester is required to investigate customer problems referred by technical support. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we can break down the task as follows:

- Investigating customer problems referred by technical support involves analyzing the reported issues, understanding the context, and potentially identifying the root cause of the problems.
- The task may require accessing relevant documentation, logs, and system information to replicate the reported issues.
- The analyst may need to communicate with technical support and customers to gather additional details or clarify the reported problems.
- Based on the investigation, the analyst may need to document their findings, propose solutions, or escalate unresolved issues.

Given the nature of the task, it involves a significant amount of human judgment, interaction, and domain-specific knowledge. While an LLM could assist in generating documentation or providing general guidance on troubleshooting, the core aspects of investigating technical issues, understanding software systems, and communicating effectively with stakeholders require human expertise.
