1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of assimilating arriving children to the school environment by greeting them, helping them remove outerwear, and selecting activities of interest to them, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves interacting with children, assisting them physically, and making decisions based on social cues and individual preferences. These actions require human interaction, physical assistance, and emotional intelligence, which are not tasks that can be effectively performed by an LLM. The LLM lacks the ability to physically assist children, interpret non-verbal cues, or engage in the nuanced social interactions necessary for this task. Therefore, the task falls under E0 as it cannot be significantly aided by the LLM.

2: E0
