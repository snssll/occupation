1: For the task of writing reports of daily activities and irregularities as a Security Guard, the exposure to LLM can be evaluated as follows:

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** The task involves writing detailed reports based on observations and incidents encountered during the shift. The LLM can assist in generating well-written reports by providing language suggestions, structuring the content, and ensuring clarity and coherence in the text. The model can help in summarizing the events and presenting them in a professional manner, potentially reducing the time needed to create comprehensive reports.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the LLM can aid in writing reports efficiently, there may not be a specific software application developed solely on top of the LLM that significantly enhances the process beyond what the model itself can offer. The task is straightforward and does not require highly specialized knowledge or complex databases that would necessitate additional software tools.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Image capabilities are not relevant for this task as it primarily involves writing reports based on textual information rather than dealing with images.

Based on the above analysis, the task of writing reports of daily activities and irregularities as a Security Guard aligns most closely with **E1 (Direct exposure)** to the LLM.
