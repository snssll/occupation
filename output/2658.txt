1: For the task of compiling, copying, sorting, and filing records of office activities as an Office Clerk, General, the exposure to LLM can be analyzed as follows:

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** The task involves a significant amount of text-based work, such as organizing records and transactions. An LLM could potentially assist in generating summaries of records, providing templates for filing systems, or even automating certain aspects of the record-keeping process. The LLM could help in transforming text and providing edits to existing records, which could reduce the time needed to complete the task with equivalent quality.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the task may not be directly reducible to half the time with just the LLM, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to create more efficient record-keeping systems, automate data entry, or provide recommendations for organizing records. Such software could enhance the capabilities of the LLM in handling large volumes of data and improving the efficiency of office clerical tasks.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Image capabilities would not significantly impact the task of compiling, copying, sorting, and filing records of office activities, as the task primarily involves text-based information and does not require detailed image processing.
