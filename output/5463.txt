1: In this task, the Atmospheric and Space Scientist is responsible for providing direct forecasting services at weather stations or broadcasting facilities. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves analyzing weather data, interpreting atmospheric conditions, and making predictions about future weather patterns. This task heavily relies on the scientist's expertise, knowledge of meteorology, and understanding of complex atmospheric processes. While an LLM could potentially assist in providing general information about weather patterns or explaining meteorological concepts, the task of direct forecasting requires real-time data analysis, interpretation, and decision-making based on current conditions, which may not be within the capabilities of the LLM. Therefore, the task falls under E0 as it involves specialized domain knowledge, real-time data analysis, and decision-making that cannot be fully automated by the LLM.
