1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of obtaining credit information about prospective customers as a Sales Representative in Wholesale and Manufacturing, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM can assist in writing and transforming text, providing edits, answering questions, and maintaining records of written data. In this case, the task involves obtaining credit information, which can be done through text-based research and data collection. The LLM can help gather information from various sources and compile it into a report for the Sales Representative.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not reduce the time significantly for this task, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to streamline the process. This software could involve searching for credit information online, analyzing financial data, and generating reports automatically based on the collected information.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not relevant for the task of obtaining credit information about prospective customers. This task primarily involves text-based research and data collection, which can be effectively handled by the LLM without the need for image capabilities.

Based on the above analysis, the task of obtaining credit information about prospective customers as a Sales Representative in Wholesale and Manufacturing is best classified as E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications.
