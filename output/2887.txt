1: In this task, a Farm and Home Management Educator is required to conduct field demonstrations of new products, techniques, or services. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone or with additional software could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task.

- E1: Direct access to the LLM could potentially help in preparing scripts or materials for the field demonstrations, providing information on new products, techniques, or services. The educator could use the LLM to draft detailed explanations, instructions, or summaries to enhance the demonstration process.

- E2: While having access to the LLM alone may not directly reduce the time to conduct field demonstrations, additional software built on top of the LLM could potentially assist in summarizing complex information about the products, techniques, or services to be demonstrated. This software could help in organizing the content, generating scripts, or providing background information efficiently.

- E3: Image capabilities would not significantly impact the task of conducting field demonstrations, as it primarily involves practical demonstrations in real-world settings rather than relying on image processing or creation.

Considering the above points, the task of conducting field demonstrations of new products, techniques, or services could be best classified as E2.
