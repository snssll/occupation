1: Traffic Technicians are responsible for collecting and analyzing data related to traffic patterns, accidents, and other transportation-related information. One of the tasks they perform is preparing graphs, charts, diagrams, or other aids to illustrate observations or conclusions. To determine the appropriate exposure label for this task in relation to the LLM, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- **E0**: This task involves creating visual aids based on data analysis, which may require a high degree of human judgment and interpretation. While an LLM could potentially assist in generating text-based analysis or summaries of the data, creating visual aids like graphs and charts may not be significantly expedited by the LLM alone. Additionally, the task does not involve detailed image processing or require specialized domain knowledge beyond what the LLM can provide.

- **E1**: If the task involved generating text-based summaries of the data that could then be used to create the visual aids, the LLM could significantly reduce the time needed for this part of the process. However, since the task specifically mentions preparing graphs, charts, and diagrams, which are more visual in nature, the direct use of the LLM may not halve the time required to complete the task.

- **E2**: While an application built on top of the LLM could potentially assist in summarizing the data or providing insights that could inform the creation of visual aids, the task itself does not inherently require specialized domain knowledge or complex databases that would significantly benefit from additional software beyond the LLM.

- **E3**: This task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images, so the additional image capabilities provided by an E3 system are not directly relevant to this task.
