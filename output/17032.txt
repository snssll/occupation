1: In this task, a Government Property Inspector or Investigator is required to testify in court or at administrative proceedings regarding their investigation findings. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in this process. 

- E0: This task involves human interaction and legal proceedings that require the expertise and judgment of a human inspector or investigator. The task of testifying in court involves providing firsthand accounts, interpretations, and responses to questions that are based on personal experiences and professional judgment. The LLM cannot replace the role of a human in such a scenario.

- E1: While the LLM could potentially assist in drafting written reports or summaries of investigation findings, it cannot directly participate in legal proceedings or testify in court. The task of testifying requires human judgment, understanding of legal procedures, and the ability to respond to questions in real-time, which the LLM is not equipped to handle.

- E2: It is challenging to imagine additional software built on top of the LLM that could significantly reduce the time it takes for a Government Property Inspector or Investigator to testify in court. Legal proceedings involve complex interactions, legal knowledge, and real-time decision-making that go beyond the capabilities of the LLM.

- E3: The task of testifying in court does not involve image capabilities that could be leveraged by the LLM. Therefore, exposure to image capabilities would not significantly impact the completion of this task.

Based on the above analysis, the most appropriate exposure label for this task is E0.

2: E0

3: High
