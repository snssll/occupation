1: In this task, a Compliance Officer is responsible for warning violators of infractions or penalties. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality. 

- The task involves straightforward communication and does not require complex decision-making or specialized domain knowledge beyond what the LLM can provide.
- The LLM can easily generate warning messages or templates for different types of violations.
