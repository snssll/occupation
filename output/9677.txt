1: In this task, Electromechanical Equipment Assemblers are required to measure parts using precision measuring instruments to determine tolerances. This task involves precise measurements that require human judgment and decision-making based on the measurements taken. The task does not involve text input or output that can be easily processed by an LLM. While the LLM could potentially provide information on how to use the measuring instruments or general information about tolerances, it cannot physically measure the parts or make judgments based on the measurements. Therefore, the task does not align with any of the exposure levels in the rubric.
