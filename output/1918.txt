1: In this task, the Aircraft Structure, Surfaces, Rigging, and Systems Assemblers are required to clean aircraft structures, parts, or components using specific cleaning products or techniques to reduce emissions. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be significantly aided by the language model. The task involves following specific instructions for cleaning, which may not benefit greatly from the language model's capabilities. The task is practical and hands-on, involving the physical cleaning of aircraft components, which cannot be directly assisted by the LLM. While the LLM could potentially provide information on different cleaning techniques or products, the actual cleaning process itself cannot be automated or significantly enhanced by the model.
