1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of investigating and reporting on accidents as a Stationary Engineer or Boiler Operator, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be completed with the help of an LLM.

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** If the task involves writing reports based on accident investigations, the LLM can assist in generating detailed and accurate reports by providing information on common causes of accidents, safety protocols, and best practices in accident reporting. The LLM can help in structuring the report, ensuring clarity and coherence in the presentation of findings.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the LLM can aid in generating text and providing information, there may be additional software that could be developed to streamline the process further. For instance, specialized software could be created to analyze accident data, extract key insights, and automatically generate reports based on the findings. This software could integrate with the LLM to enhance the efficiency of the reporting process.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Since the task of investigating accidents may involve reviewing images or diagrams related to the incidents, having access to image capabilities along with the LLM could potentially aid in analyzing visual evidence. The system could assist in captioning images, creating visual representations of accident scenarios, or editing digital images to enhance the clarity of the report.

Based on the above considerations, the task of investigating and reporting on accidents as a Stationary Engineer or Boiler Operator could be classified as **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications)**. While the LLM can provide valuable information and aid in report writing, the development of specialized software could further optimize the process of analyzing accident data and generating comprehensive reports.
