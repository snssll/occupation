1: In this task, a lodging manager is required to observe and monitor staff performance to ensure efficient operations and adherence to the facility's policies and procedures. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves observing and monitoring staff performance, which is primarily a human interaction and observation-based activity. While the LLM could potentially assist in generating reports or providing insights based on data input, the core aspect of observing and monitoring staff performance in real-time would still require human judgment and interaction. The LLM may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task, as it cannot directly observe staff performance or ensure adherence to policies and procedures. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not clearly decrease the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete the task with high quality by at least half.
