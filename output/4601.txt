1: In this task, a Plasterer and Stucco Mason needs to determine the materials required for a job and place orders accordingly. With access to the powerful OpenAI large language model (LLM), the worker can input details about the job requirements, such as the area to be covered, the type of surface, and any specific material preferences. The LLM can then assist in calculating the quantities of plaster, stucco, and other materials needed based on industry standards and best practices. Additionally, the LLM can help in sourcing suppliers, comparing prices, and generating order forms. Overall, the LLM can significantly streamline the process of determining materials and placing orders by providing accurate calculations and recommendations.

Considering the capabilities of the LLM in assisting with text input and output tasks, such as calculations, recommendations, and generating forms, this task falls under the category of E1 - Direct exposure. The LLM can effectively reduce the time it takes to complete the task by at least half by providing accurate material estimations and order placement assistance.
