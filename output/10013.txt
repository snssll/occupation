1: In this task, a food server in a non-restaurant setting is required to monitor food preparation or serving techniques to ensure proper procedures are followed. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be significantly aided by the use of the language model. The task involves observing and ensuring compliance with established procedures, which is primarily a hands-on and visual task. While the LLM could potentially provide information on food safety procedures or guidelines, it cannot physically monitor or observe the actual food preparation process. Therefore, the task does not align well with the capabilities of the LLM, and it is unlikely that the model can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task.
