1: In this task, a veterinarian is required to determine the effects of drug therapies, antibiotics, or new surgical techniques by testing them on animals. This task involves conducting experiments on animals to evaluate the efficacy and safety of different treatments. The task does not involve text input or output, and it requires hands-on experimentation and observation. Since the task involves physical experimentation and does not rely on text-based information processing, it falls under the E0 category. The LLM cannot directly assist in conducting experiments on animals or evaluating the effects of drug therapies through physical testing.
