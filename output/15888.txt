1: In this task, a sewer is required to sew buttonholes or add lace or other trimming to garments. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete the task with high quality by at least half.

- E0: This task involves physical sewing, which cannot be automated by the LLM or any software tool. The intricate work of sewing buttonholes or adding lace requires manual dexterity and precision, which cannot be replicated by text-based AI models.

- E1: While the LLM could potentially provide instructions or guidance on how to sew buttonholes or add trimming, it cannot physically perform the task. The actual sewing work is hands-on and cannot be directly completed by the LLM.

- E2: It is challenging to imagine additional software that could be developed on top of the LLM to automate the physical act of sewing buttonholes or adding lace. This task is highly manual and requires human skills that are not easily replicable by software.

- E3: The task of sewing buttonholes or adding lace does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images. Therefore, image capabilities would not significantly impact the completion of this task.
