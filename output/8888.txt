1: In this task, the crane and tower operator is responsible for loading or unloading bundles from trucks and moving containers to storage bins using moving equipment. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality. Since this task involves physical operation of moving equipment and handling loads, it cannot be directly completed using the LLM. The LLM does not have the capability to physically operate machinery or handle physical objects, so it cannot directly assist in completing this task.
