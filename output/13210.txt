1: In this task, a Licensed Practical or Licensed Vocational Nurse is required to provide basic patient care or treatments, such as taking temperatures, dressing wounds, treating bedsores, giving enemas, etc. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves hands-on patient care that requires physical interaction and specialized medical knowledge. While an LLM could potentially provide information on medical procedures or guidelines, it cannot physically perform the tasks involved in patient care. Therefore, the task falls under E0 as it does not involve tasks that can be significantly expedited or enhanced by the use of an LLM.

2: E0
