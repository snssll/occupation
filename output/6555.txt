1: To determine the appropriate exposure label for the task of examining and analyzing tax assets and liabilities to determine the resolution of delinquent tax problems, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could assist in completing it. 

- Tax examination and analysis involve reviewing financial documents, understanding tax laws and regulations, and making decisions based on complex information.
- The LLM can assist in providing information on tax laws and regulations, offering insights into financial analysis, and generating potential solutions based on the input data.
- While the LLM can provide general information and suggestions, it may not have access to up-to-date tax laws or specific financial data required for accurate analysis.
- The task also involves making decisions based on the analysis, which may require human judgment and expertise beyond what the LLM can provide.

Based on these considerations, the task falls under E2 - Exposure by LLM-powered applications. While the LLM can assist in providing information and generating potential solutions, additional software tailored to tax examination and analysis tasks would be needed to significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with high quality.
