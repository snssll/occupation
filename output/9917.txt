1: In this task, a Stationary Engineer or Boiler Operator is required to monitor and inspect various equipment to ensure they are operating efficiently and safely. This task involves observing and checking different components of machinery and systems. While an LLM could potentially assist in providing information on the standard procedures for monitoring and inspecting equipment, it cannot physically carry out the monitoring and inspection process. The task also involves hands-on work and direct interaction with machinery, which cannot be replaced by the LLM. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not clearly decrease the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete the task with high quality by at least half.
