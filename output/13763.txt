1: In this task for Data Entry Keyers, the main activity involves reading source documents and entering data into specific fields using keyboards or scanners. This task is highly text-based and involves processing information from documents into a digital format. A large language model (LLM) could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task by providing assistance in reading, understanding, and potentially even extracting data from the source documents. The LLM could help in recognizing patterns, suggesting data entry formats, and even automating some parts of the data entry process. Overall, the LLM could streamline the data entry process and improve efficiency.

Considering the nature of the task and the potential for the LLM to assist in various aspects of data entry, I would classify this task as E1 - Direct exposure.
