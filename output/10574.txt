1: Commercial pilots need to obtain and review various data to determine flight plans. With the help of an LLM, a pilot could potentially input the relevant data and receive assistance in analyzing it to determine the best flight plan. The LLM could help in processing information related to load weights, fuel supplies, weather conditions, and flight schedules to suggest optimal routes or identify necessary adjustments. However, the task also involves real-time decision-making based on dynamic factors like weather updates, air traffic conditions, and unforeseen circumstances, which may not be effectively handled by an LLM alone. Therefore, while the LLM could assist in data analysis and planning, the real-time nature of piloting may limit the extent to which the task can be fully automated.
