1: In this task, a sheet metal worker is required to fasten roof panel edges or machine-made moldings to structures by nailing or welding. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. This task involves physical work that requires manual labor and expertise in metalworking techniques. The task does not involve text input or output, and the context is primarily related to hands-on construction work rather than information processing. As such, the task does not align with the capabilities of the LLM, which is focused on text-based tasks and information processing. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not benefit from the capabilities of the LLM.
