1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of submitting project deliverables to clients as a Project Management Specialist, we need to consider the level of exposure to LLM. 

- E0: This task involves interacting with clients, ensuring quality standards, and managing project deliverables, which are all human-centric activities that require a high degree of human interaction and decision-making. LLM cannot replace the need for direct client communication and decision-making in this context.

- E1: While the LLM could potentially assist in drafting emails or reports related to project deliverables, the core aspect of client interaction and ensuring quality standards would still require human judgment and communication. The task is not solely text-based and involves a significant amount of human interaction and decision-making.

- E2: It is conceivable that software could be developed on top of the LLM to help organize project deliverables, track adherence to quality standards, or even automate certain communication aspects. However, the complexity of client interactions and the nuanced judgment required in project management may limit the extent to which LLM-powered tools can significantly reduce the time needed to complete this task.

- E3: The task does not involve image processing or detailed visual analysis, so exposure to image capabilities would not significantly impact the completion of this task.
