1: In this task, Funeral Attendants are responsible for obtaining burial permits and registering deaths. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task and how LLM could assist in completing it. 

- Funeral Attendants typically need to navigate legal requirements and paperwork related to deaths and burials. The task of obtaining burial permits and registering deaths involves dealing with official documentation and procedures.
- The LLM could potentially assist by providing information on the process of obtaining burial permits, legal requirements for registering deaths, and possibly even generating template documents or responses.
- While the LLM can provide general information and guidance on the task, it may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task, as it involves specific legal and administrative processes that may require human verification and interaction.
- The task does not involve complex data analysis, specialized domain knowledge, or image processing that would significantly benefit from additional software beyond the LLM itself.

Based on these considerations, the task of obtaining burial permits and registering deaths for Funeral Attendants would likely fall under E0 as the use of the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with high quality.
