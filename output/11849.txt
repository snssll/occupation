1: In this task, a Helper-Roofer is responsible for placing tiles on a roof, nailing them to roof boards, and covering nailheads with roofing cement. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the complexity of the task and whether the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete it with equivalent quality.

- The task involves physical labor such as placing tiles and nailing them, which cannot be directly assisted by the LLM.
- The task does not involve complex decision-making or specialized knowledge that would benefit significantly from LLM capabilities.
- The task does not require text input or output, making it unsuitable for direct interaction with the LLM.
- While the LLM could potentially provide general information on roofing techniques or safety guidelines, it would not significantly impact the completion of the physical task itself.

Based on these considerations, the task falls under E0 as it does not meet the criteria for exposure to LLM assistance.
