1: In this task, the helper is required to repair and maintain automotive and drilling equipment using hand tools. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. Repairing and maintaining equipment involves hands-on work that requires physical interaction with the tools and machinery. This task does not involve writing, summarizing, analyzing text, or any other activity that can be directly assisted by an LLM. The LLM cannot physically repair or maintain equipment, and the task does not involve text-based activities that the LLM could significantly assist with. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM or any tools built on top of it.
