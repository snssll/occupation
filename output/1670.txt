1: In this task, a Fuel Cell Engineer is required to calculate the efficiency or power output of a fuel cell system or process. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The LLM can assist in providing information on fuel cell technology, explaining concepts related to efficiency and power output, and potentially even providing formulas or equations for calculations. However, the actual calculation itself involves specific technical knowledge and expertise in fuel cell engineering, which the LLM may not possess. While the LLM can provide general guidance and information, the task ultimately requires specialized domain knowledge and expertise to perform the calculations accurately.
