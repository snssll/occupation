1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of gathering and reviewing climate-related studies as a Climate Change Policy Analyst, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM in assisting with this task. The LLM can help in summarizing documents, providing feedback on documents, and answering questions about documents. In this case, the task involves gathering and reviewing climate-related studies from various sources, which can be time-consuming and require analyzing a large amount of text. The LLM can assist in summarizing these studies, providing insights, and potentially even identifying key points for analysis. However, the task does not involve specialized domain knowledge or highly complex databases that would require additional software beyond the LLM itself. Therefore, the task falls under E1 as the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality by at least half.
