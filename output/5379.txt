1: In this task, a Fundraising Manager is responsible for directing activities related to developing and implementing fundraising strategies and programs. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves overseeing external agencies, establishments, or departments in the fundraising process. This task requires a high level of human interaction, decision-making, and strategic planning. While the LLM can provide information on fundraising strategies and programs, it cannot replace the need for human oversight, collaboration, and relationship-building in fundraising activities. Additionally, the task involves making decisions that impact fundraising efforts, which cannot be fully automated by the LLM. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not significantly benefit from LLM capabilities in reducing the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete the task.
