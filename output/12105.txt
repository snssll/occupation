1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of planning, scheduling, or coordinating project activities to meet deadlines as a Project Management Specialist, we need to consider how the LLM can assist in this task. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM can help in writing and transforming text by providing templates, creating schedules, and drafting project plans based on input. It can also assist in providing edits to existing project documents and summarizing project progress reports. Therefore, the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality by at least half.
- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to further streamline project management tasks, the core task of planning, scheduling, and coordinating project activities can already be efficiently supported by the LLM alone.
- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not relevant for this task as it primarily involves text-based project management activities.

Based on the above analysis, the task of planning, scheduling, or coordinating project activities to meet deadlines as a Project Management Specialist falls under E1: Direct exposure.
