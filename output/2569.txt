1: In this task, a Cardiovascular Technologist or Technician is required to compare measurements of heart wall thickness and chamber sizes to standard norms to identify abnormalities. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could assist in completing it.

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** The task involves comparing measurements and identifying abnormalities based on standard norms. The LLM could potentially assist in providing information on standard norms for heart wall thickness and chamber sizes. It could also help in interpreting the measurements and providing insights into what constitutes abnormalities. The LLM could generate text explaining the significance of certain measurements and how they deviate from the norm, aiding the technician in their analysis.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the LLM could provide valuable information and insights, it may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task by half. However, with the development of specialized software that integrates the LLM's capabilities with real-time data on standard norms and abnormalities in cardiovascular measurements, the task could potentially be completed more efficiently.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** This task does not involve image processing or detailed visual analysis, so the image capabilities of the LLM would not significantly impact the completion of the task.

Considering the above points, the task of comparing measurements of heart wall thickness and chamber sizes to standard norms to identify abnormalities aligns best with **E1 (Direct exposure)** as the LLM can directly assist in providing information and insights relevant to the task.
