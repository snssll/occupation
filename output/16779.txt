1: In this task, the Low Vision Therapists, Orientation and Mobility Specialists, and Vision Rehabilitation Therapists are required to teach cane skills to individuals with visual impairments. This task involves hands-on training and demonstration of various techniques such as cane use with a guide, diagonal techniques, and two-point touches. The task does not involve text input or output that can be directly processed by an LLM. It requires physical interaction, demonstration, and feedback, which cannot be replicated by the LLM. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM or any tools built on top of it.
