1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of observing alarm registers and scanning maps to determine if a specific emergency is in the dispatch service area for Public Safety Telecommunicators, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves analyzing visual information (maps) and making a decision based on that information. The LLM does not have the ability to view, caption, or create images, so it cannot directly assist with scanning maps. Additionally, the task requires real-time decision-making based on the visual information, which the LLM cannot do. Therefore, the task does not fall under E1, E2, or E3 exposure categories as the LLM alone cannot significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with high quality.
