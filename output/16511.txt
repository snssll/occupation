1: In this task, an embalmer is required to supervise funeral attendants and other funeral home staff. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if the task can be significantly expedited or improved by using the LLM. The task involves human interaction and supervision, which does not directly benefit from the text-based capabilities of the LLM. The LLM cannot physically supervise staff or interact with them in person, so it cannot directly assist in this task. Additionally, the task does not involve complex text-based instructions, writing, summarizing, or any other text-related activities that the LLM could enhance. Therefore, the task does not fall under E1, E2, or E3 categories.

2: E0
