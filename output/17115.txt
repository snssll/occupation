1: In this task, the occupation of surveyors involves training assistants and helpers to perform surveys or draft maps under their direction. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if the task can be significantly expedited or improved by using the LLM. 

- Direct exposure (E1): The task of training assistants and helpers involves a significant amount of human interaction, guidance, and hands-on training. While the LLM could potentially assist in creating training materials or providing information on surveying techniques, the core aspect of training and directing work requires human interaction and practical experience. Therefore, the direct use of the LLM is unlikely to reduce the time significantly for an experienced worker to complete this task.

- Exposure by LLM-powered applications (E2): It is conceivable that specialized software could be developed on top of the LLM to assist in creating training materials, providing guidance on surveying techniques, or organizing information. However, the nature of training assistants and helpers in surveying involves practical skills, fieldwork, and hands-on experience, which may not be effectively replaced or significantly expedited by LLM-powered applications alone.

- Exposure given image capabilities (E3): Image capabilities would not have a significant impact on training assistants and helpers in surveying tasks. While visual aids could be helpful in some aspects of training, the core of the task involves practical training, guidance, and fieldwork which cannot be effectively replaced by image capabilities.

Based on the analysis, the task of training assistants and helpers in surveying is best classified as E0, as the use of the LLM or LLM-powered tools is unlikely to significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task.
