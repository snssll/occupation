1: In this task, an orthodontist is required to study various diagnostic records to develop patient treatment plans. With access to the most powerful OpenAI large language model (LLM), the model can assist in summarizing and analyzing the information present in these records. The LLM can help in interpreting medical or dental histories, understanding plaster models of teeth, analyzing photos of a patient's face and teeth, and interpreting X-rays. The model can also provide insights into common treatment plans based on the information provided in the records. Overall, the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes for an orthodontist to analyze and interpret these diagnostic records, leading to more efficient treatment planning.
