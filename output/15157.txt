1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of reviewing scientific proposals and research papers as an astronomer, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it. 

- E0: Since reviewing scientific proposals and research papers involves a high level of expertise, critical thinking, and domain-specific knowledge, it is unlikely that the LLM alone or tools built on top of it could significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced astronomer to complete this task with high quality. The task requires deep understanding, analysis, and evaluation of complex scientific content, which may not be effectively handled by the LLM.

- E1: While the LLM could potentially assist in summarizing documents or providing initial insights into the content of scientific proposals and research papers, the task of reviewing them involves more than just text processing. It requires domain-specific expertise, understanding of current research trends, and the ability to critically evaluate the scientific merit of the work. The LLM may help with some aspects of the task, but it is unlikely to reduce the time significantly or match the expertise required for thorough review.

- E2: It is conceivable that additional software built on top of the LLM could be developed to assist astronomers in summarizing lengthy documents, retrieving relevant information from databases, or even providing recommendations based on existing research. However, the complexity of evaluating scientific proposals and research papers goes beyond text processing and would require specialized tools tailored to the field of astronomy.

- E3: Given the task does not involve image processing or detailed visual analysis, the inclusion of image capabilities would not significantly impact the time it takes to review scientific proposals and research papers as an astronomer.
