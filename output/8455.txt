1: In this task, a coroner is required to interview individuals present at death scenes to gather information that can help determine the manner of death. With the help of an LLM, the coroner could potentially generate a list of relevant questions to ask during these interviews, based on common patterns and factors that may be indicative of different manners of death. The LLM could also assist in summarizing the information gathered during the interviews, organizing it in a structured manner, and even providing suggestions on potential follow-up questions based on the initial responses. Additionally, the LLM could aid in drafting reports based on the collected information, ensuring that all key details are included. Overall, the LLM could significantly streamline the information-gathering and documentation process for coroners, making their workflow more efficient.
