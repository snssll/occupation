1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of positioning instructions and comments onto drawings as a Mechanical Drafter, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The task involves writing and transforming text onto drawings according to specific instructions. The LLM can assist in generating text based on given instructions, which could potentially speed up the process of adding comments onto drawings. The LLM can help drafters come up with precise wording and formatting for the instructions, saving time and effort.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to streamline the process. For example, a specialized tool could be created that allows drafters to input instructions and automatically generates the text in the desired format on the drawings. This tool could integrate with the LLM to provide efficient assistance.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - This task does not involve reading text from PDFs or editing digital images, so the image capabilities of the LLM are not directly relevant to completing this task.

Considering the above points, the task of positioning instructions and comments onto drawings as a Mechanical Drafter could be best classified as E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications.
