1: In this task, a Financial Manager is responsible for establishing procedures for the custody or control of assets, records, loan collateral, or securities to ensure safekeeping. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves setting up procedures, which may require writing and transforming text according to specific instructions.
- It may involve providing edits to existing procedures or documents following certain specifications.
- The task could potentially benefit from the LLM's ability to generate recommendations based on general knowledge or financial best practices.
- While the task does not involve highly specialized domain knowledge, it does require a good understanding of financial management principles, which the LLM can provide information on.
- The LLM could assist in preparing training materials related to financial management procedures.

Considering these points, the task falls under E1 as the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task by providing relevant information, generating recommendations, and assisting in writing and transforming text to establish the required procedures.
