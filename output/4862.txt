1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of developing designs using specialized computer software as a Craft Artist, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. In this case, the task involves using specialized computer software, which implies a level of creativity and expertise in design. While the LLM can assist with generating text-based content and providing information, it may not have the ability to directly interact with design software or create visual designs. The task requires hands-on manipulation of design tools, which is beyond the current capabilities of the LLM. Therefore, the task does not fall under E1, E2, or E3 as the LLM alone cannot significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task of developing designs using specialized computer software for Craft Artists.
