1: In this task, a Search Marketing Strategist is required to propose online or multiple-sales-channel campaigns to marketing executives. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM can assist in completing it. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM can help in generating campaign proposals by providing insights, suggestions, and even draft campaign plans based on the input provided. It can assist in crafting persuasive and data-driven proposals to present to marketing executives. The LLM can also help in refining the language, ensuring clarity and coherence in the proposals.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM can aid in generating content for the campaign proposals, additional software could be developed to streamline the process further. This software could automate parts of the proposal creation, integrate real-time data for campaign optimization, and provide detailed analytics to support the proposed strategies.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not directly relevant to this task as it primarily involves proposing online or multiple-sales-channel campaigns through text-based content. Therefore, image capabilities would not significantly impact the completion of this task.

Based on the above analysis, the task of proposing online or multiple-sales-channel campaigns to marketing executives aligns best with the E2 label, as while the LLM can assist in generating content, additional software could further enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposal creation process.
