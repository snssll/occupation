1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of interviewing clients by telephone or in person to gather financial information as a Credit Counselor, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be aided by the use of a large language model (LLM).

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** The task involves conducting interviews with clients to gather financial information. An LLM could potentially assist in preparing interview questions, analyzing responses, and generating reports based on the gathered information. The LLM could also help in drafting follow-up communications or recommendations for clients based on the financial data collected. Overall, the LLM could significantly reduce the time and effort required to conduct these interviews and process the financial information.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the LLM alone can streamline the process of conducting interviews and processing financial information, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to further enhance the efficiency of this task. For example, specialized applications could be created to automatically extract key financial data from interview transcripts, generate personalized financial advice based on client responses, or provide real-time analysis of financial situations. These applications could further optimize the workflow of Credit Counselors in gathering and utilizing financial information.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Image capabilities are not directly relevant to the task of interviewing clients to gather financial information. This task primarily involves verbal communication and data collection, which can be effectively handled by the LLM without the need for image processing.
