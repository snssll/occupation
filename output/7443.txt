1: In this task, a Solar Photovoltaic Installer needs to identify installation locations suitable for PV arrays based on factors like orientation, area, solar access, and structural integrity. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we can break down the task:
- Identifying suitable installation locations involves analyzing various factors and making decisions based on technical knowledge and site-specific conditions.
- While the LLM can provide general information about solar energy and PV systems, it may not have access to real-time data on specific locations' orientation, area, solar access, or structural integrity.
- The task requires expertise in assessing physical locations, which may involve on-site visits, measurements, and detailed analysis beyond what an LLM can provide.
