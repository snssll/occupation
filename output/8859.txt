1: In this task, the Light Truck Driver is responsible for loading and unloading trucks, vans, or automobiles. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality. Since this task involves physical labor and manual work, it cannot be directly completed using the LLM. The LLM does not have the capability to physically load or unload vehicles. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not meet the criteria for exposure to the LLM.

2: E0

3: High
