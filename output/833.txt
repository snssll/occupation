1: In this task, the occupation of Acupuncturists involves applying moxibustion to patients. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if the task can be significantly expedited or improved by using the LLM. Since the task involves a physical procedure of applying moxibustion, which requires hands-on interaction with patients, it cannot be directly assisted by the LLM. The LLM cannot physically apply moxibustion or interact with patients in person. Additionally, this task does not involve complex data analysis, writing, or information retrieval that the LLM could significantly enhance. Therefore, the task does not fall under E1, E2, or E3 categories.
