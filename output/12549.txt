1: In this task, a Landscape Architect is required to prepare graphic representations or drawings of proposed plans or designs. With the help of the LLM, the architect could potentially generate text descriptions of the proposed plans or designs, which could then be used as a basis for creating the graphic representations. The LLM could assist in providing detailed descriptions, dimensions, and other relevant information that could be translated into visual representations. However, the LLM itself does not have the capability to directly create graphic representations or drawings. Therefore, while the LLM could aid in the initial stages of planning and design by providing textual descriptions, additional software or tools would be needed to translate this text into actual graphic representations. This task falls under E2 exposure as it could benefit from the development of software that can work in conjunction with the LLM to create graphic representations based on the text input provided.
