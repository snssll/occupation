1: In this task, the occupation involves repairing and maintaining metal forms and equipment using hand tools, sledges, and bars. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality. Since this task involves physical repair work with hand tools, sledges, and bars, it does not directly involve text input or output that the LLM can assist with. The LLM cannot physically repair or maintain metal forms and equipment, so it cannot directly impact the completion time of this task.
