1: In this task, the Bus and Truck Mechanics and Diesel Engine Specialists are required to install or repair accessories on buses, trucks, or diesel engines. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. Installing or repairing accessories may involve specific technical knowledge, understanding of different vehicle systems, and hands-on skills. While the task description is relatively straightforward, the actual execution may require physical interaction with the vehicles and tools, which cannot be performed by the LLM. The LLM lacks the ability to physically interact with objects, making it unsuitable for tasks that involve hands-on work like repairing or installing accessories on vehicles. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not benefit from the capabilities of the LLM.
