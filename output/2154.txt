1: In this task, the Makeup Artist is required to cleanse and tone the skin before applying makeup. This task involves specific steps and techniques to ensure the skin is properly prepped for makeup application. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced Makeup Artist to complete this task with high quality.

- E0: This task involves physical interaction with the client's skin, which cannot be replaced by text-based tools like the LLM. The LLM cannot physically cleanse or tone the skin, so it cannot directly assist in this task.

- E1: The LLM could potentially provide written instructions or guidance on the best practices for cleansing and toning the skin before makeup application. However, since this task involves physical actions and techniques, the LLM alone cannot perform the task or significantly reduce the time it takes to complete it.

- E2: While the LLM could potentially provide general information on skincare routines or products, it cannot directly perform the task of cleansing and toning the skin. Additional software that could be developed on top of the LLM, such as a virtual skincare assistant, might be able to provide step-by-step guidance or recommendations for cleansing and toning routines, but such a tool would require more than just text-based capabilities.

- E3: The task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images, so the image capabilities of the LLM are not relevant in this context.
