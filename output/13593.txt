1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of "Purchase equipment, materials, or parts" for Manufacturing Engineers in terms of exposure to LLM, we need to consider the nature of the task and how LLM could potentially assist in completing it more efficiently.

- E0: This task involves making purchasing decisions which require human judgment, negotiation skills, and possibly interactions with vendors. LLM may not significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task as it involves real-time decision-making and interactions that cannot be fully automated.

- E1: LLM could potentially assist in researching and providing information on equipment, materials, or parts. It could help in generating lists of potential suppliers, comparing prices, or summarizing specifications. However, the actual purchasing decision and negotiation process would still require human intervention.

- E2: With additional software development, LLM could be integrated with databases of suppliers, pricing information, and inventory levels to provide real-time recommendations for purchasing decisions. It could also analyze historical data to optimize purchasing strategies. This would require a more specialized application beyond the capabilities of the base LLM.

- E3: Image capabilities would not significantly impact the task of purchasing equipment, materials, or parts as it primarily involves text-based information and interactions with suppliers. Therefore, image capabilities are not relevant in this context.
