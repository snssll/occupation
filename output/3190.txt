1: In this task, a Financial and Investment Analyst is required to confer with clients to restructure debt, refinance debt, or raise new debt. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves interacting with clients to discuss financial matters, which requires human interaction and decision-making based on nuanced financial information and client needs. 
- While the LLM can provide information on financial concepts and strategies, it cannot replace the personalized advice and negotiation skills needed in client meetings.
- The task also involves understanding the specific financial situation of each client, which may not be captured accurately by the LLM without up-to-date and detailed information.
- Additionally, the task may involve legal considerations and regulations that require human expertise and judgment.

Based on these considerations, the task of conferring with clients to restructure debt, refinance debt, or raise new debt is best classified as E0 - No exposure to LLM.
