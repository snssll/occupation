1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of forecasting political, economic, and social trends as a Political Scientist, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The LLM can process text input and output text based on the context provided within 2000 words. In this case, the task involves analyzing and predicting trends in various domains, which requires a deep understanding of current events, historical data, and expert knowledge in political science.

- E0: This task involves a high level of expertise, critical thinking, and analysis that goes beyond what the LLM can provide on its own. The LLM may assist in gathering information or generating some insights, but the final forecasting would require human judgment and domain expertise.

- E1: While the LLM can provide information on current events and historical data, forecasting trends involves complex analysis, interpretation, and domain-specific knowledge that the LLM may not possess. The LLM can assist in gathering data and generating some insights, but the final forecasting would likely require significant human input.

- E2: It is conceivable that additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to assist Political Scientists in trend forecasting by summarizing vast amounts of data, providing recommendations based on historical trends, and analyzing complex relationships. However, the task still heavily relies on human expertise and judgment.

- E3: The task of forecasting trends does not directly involve image processing capabilities, so exposure to image capabilities would not significantly impact the completion of this task.

2: E0

3: Moderate
