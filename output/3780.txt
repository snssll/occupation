1: In this task, a Set and Exhibit Designer is responsible for coordinating the transportation of sets built off-site and setting them up at the site of use. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves logistical coordination, which may require communication, planning, and organization skills.
- The task does not involve complex decision-making that impacts human livelihood or legal requirements.
- The task does not involve precise measurements or detailed visuals that would require human interaction.
- While the task may benefit from written communication skills, negotiation, and coordination, it does not inherently require specialized domain knowledge beyond general logistics and design principles.

Based on these considerations, the task does not significantly benefit from the capabilities of an LLM or additional software beyond what is commonly available for logistical coordination tasks.
