1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of providing staff and users with assistance in solving computer-related problems as a Computer Systems Analyst, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The task involves responding to computer-related issues and providing solutions. The LLM could be used to generate responses to common problems, provide troubleshooting steps, or offer explanations for technical issues. By leveraging the LLM's capabilities to generate text and code, the task of assisting with computer problems could be significantly expedited and completed with equivalent quality.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not reduce the time it takes to complete the task by half, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to streamline the process further. This software could potentially analyze complex technical issues, retrieve relevant information from databases, or provide tailored solutions based on specific user queries.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not directly relevant to the task of providing assistance with computer-related problems, as the task primarily involves text-based communication and troubleshooting rather than visual analysis.

Based on the above considerations, the task of providing staff and users with assistance in solving computer-related problems as a Computer Systems Analyst is best classified as E1: Direct exposure.
