1: In this task, a manicurist or pedicurist uses rotary abrasive wheels to shape and smooth nails or artificial extensions. This task involves physical manipulation and precision in working with nails, which cannot be directly performed by an LLM. The LLM does not have the capability to physically interact with objects or perform tasks that require precise measurements or physical dexterity. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not involve text input or output that can be processed by the LLM.
