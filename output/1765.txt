1: In this task, the Clinical Nurse Specialist is required to chair nursing departments or committees. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality. 

- E0: This task involves human interaction and decision-making that cannot be fully automated by the LLM. It requires leadership skills, communication, and collaboration, which are not within the capabilities of the LLM.
- E1: The LLM can provide information or guidance on how to chair nursing departments or committees, but it cannot fully replace the human skills and interactions needed for this task. While it can assist in generating documents or providing information, the core aspects of chairing a committee require human judgment and leadership.
- E2: It is conceivable that software could be developed on top of the LLM to assist in organizing information, generating reports, or providing recommendations for committee meetings. However, the core task of chairing a committee still heavily relies on human skills and decision-making.
- E3: Image capabilities are not relevant for this task.
