1: In this task, a Fence Erector is responsible for stretching wire, wire mesh, or chain link fencing between posts and attaching the fencing to frames. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves physical labor, such as stretching wire and attaching fencing, which cannot be directly performed by an LLM. The task does not involve complex decision-making, specialized domain knowledge, or detailed data analysis that would significantly benefit from LLM capabilities. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM or any tools built on top of it.

2: E0
