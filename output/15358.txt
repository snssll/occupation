1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of screening job applicants and hiring new employees as a First-Line Supervisor of Housekeeping and Janitorial Workers, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be supported by the capabilities of the LLM. 

- E0: This task involves human interaction, decision-making based on interviews, and assessments of candidates beyond just written information. The LLM cannot make final hiring decisions that impact human livelihood, so it cannot fully replace the human judgment required in this task. Therefore, this task is not suitable for automation using the LLM.

- E1: While the LLM can assist in drafting job descriptions, screening questions, or email templates for communication with applicants, the core task of interviewing candidates, assessing their fit for the role, and making final hiring decisions involves a high degree of human judgment and interaction. The LLM can provide some support in the initial stages of the hiring process, but it cannot fully automate the task of screening and hiring new employees.

- E2: With additional software development, it is conceivable that an application could be built on top of the LLM to assist in screening job applicants by analyzing resumes, conducting initial screenings based on predefined criteria, or even providing recommendations based on candidate profiles. However, the final hiring decision would still require human judgment and interaction. The LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task, but with the right application, it could streamline certain aspects of the hiring process.

- E3: Image capabilities are not relevant to the task of screening job applicants and hiring new employees in this context.
