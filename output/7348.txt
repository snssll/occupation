1: In this task, a Helper in Installation, Maintenance, and Repair Workers is responsible for holding or supplying tools, parts, equipment, and supplies for other workers. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task. Since the task involves physical actions like holding tools and supplies, it does not seem like the LLM or any LLM-powered tool can directly assist in completing this task. The task does not involve complex written instructions, data analysis, decision-making, or any other activity where the LLM could provide substantial assistance.
