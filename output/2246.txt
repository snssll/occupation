- E0: This task involves human collaboration, decision-making, and integration of logistics with various business functions. It requires understanding the specific needs of different departments and aligning logistics processes accordingly. The task does not involve direct text-based interactions or data processing that could be significantly expedited by an LLM.

- E1: While an LLM could potentially assist in generating written communications or summaries related to the integration of logistics with business systems, the core aspect of this task involves collaboration, decision-making, and understanding complex business processes. The LLM may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality.

- E2: An LLM-powered application could potentially assist in summarizing documents related to logistics and business systems, retrieving relevant information, or providing recommendations based on data. However, the task still heavily relies on human judgment, collaboration, and decision-making, which may not be significantly expedited by the LLM alone.

- E3: Image capabilities are not relevant for this task as it primarily involves text-based interactions and collaboration between departments.
