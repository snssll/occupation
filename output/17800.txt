1: In this task, the occupation involves demonstrators and product promoters working as a team to accommodate large crowds. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone or with additional software could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality. 

- Demonstrating and accommodating large crowds require physical presence and interaction, which cannot be replaced by text-based interactions with the LLM.
- The task does not involve writing, summarizing documents, providing feedback on documents, or any other text-based activities that the LLM could directly assist with.
- While the LLM could potentially provide information or guidance on how to manage large crowds, the core aspect of physically accommodating crowds as a team cannot be directly facilitated by the LLM.

Based on these considerations, it is clear that the task of working as part of a team of demonstrators to accommodate large crowds falls under the E0 label as it does not benefit from direct exposure to the LLM.
