1: In this task, a rigger is responsible for attaching pulleys and blocks to fixed overhead structures using bolts and clamps. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone or additional software could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality.

- E0: This task involves physical work that cannot be performed by the LLM or any software tools. It requires hands-on skills and precise measurements, making it unsuitable for automation by the LLM.

- E1: The task description does not involve text input or output that the LLM could directly assist with. The task is practical and manual, requiring physical interaction with structures and tools. Therefore, the LLM would not be able to reduce the time it takes to complete this task by at least half.

- E2: While it's conceivable that specialized software could be developed to assist riggers in planning or organizing their tasks, the core activity of physically attaching pulleys and blocks to structures remains a manual process. The LLM alone would not significantly expedite this task.

- E3: The task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images. Therefore, the LLM's capabilities combined with image processing tools would not provide a significant advantage in completing this task.
