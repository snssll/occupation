1: In this task, a Surveying and Mapping Technician is required to prepare cost estimates for mapping projects. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves analyzing project requirements, understanding mapping techniques, and estimating costs based on various factors such as labor, equipment, and materials.
- The task does not involve direct text input or output that can be easily automated by an LLM. It requires specialized knowledge in surveying and mapping.
- While an LLM could potentially assist in providing general information on mapping techniques or cost estimation principles, it may not significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced technician to prepare accurate cost estimates for mapping projects.
- Developing software on top of the LLM that could accurately estimate costs for mapping projects would require highly specialized domain knowledge and complex algorithms, making it less likely to reduce the time significantly.

Based on these considerations, the task of preparing cost estimates for mapping projects is best classified as E0 - No exposure.

2: E0

3: Moderate
