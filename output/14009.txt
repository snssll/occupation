1: In this task, a food server working in a non-restaurant setting would need to record the amounts and types of special food items served to customers. With the help of the LLM, the food server could potentially automate this task by inputting the information and having the model generate a detailed record. The LLM could assist in accurately documenting the special food items served, quantities, and any other relevant details. This would involve writing down the information in a structured format, which the LLM could then process and organize effectively. As a result, the LLM could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality, making it fall under the E1 label.
