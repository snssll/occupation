1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of picking up and delivering furniture as part of the occupation of Upholsterers, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task itself involves physical actions of transporting furniture, which cannot be directly assisted by the LLM or any software tools built on top of it. The task does not involve text input or output, complex instructions, data analysis, or decision-making that can be significantly aided by the LLM. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not align with any of the exposure levels described in the rubric.
