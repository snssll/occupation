1: In this task, a Customs Broker is required to quote duty and tax rates on goods to be imported, based on federal tariffs and excise taxes. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves accessing and understanding federal tariffs and excise taxes, which may require searching and interpreting complex legal documents and regulations.
- The task also involves providing accurate quotes based on this information, which requires precision and attention to detail.
- While an LLM could potentially assist in summarizing or interpreting some of the information related to tariffs and taxes, the task involves specialized domain knowledge that may not be readily available in the LLM's training data.
- Additionally, the task may require accessing up-to-date information on federal tariffs, which the LLM may not be able to provide without recent data.

Based on these considerations, the task falls under E2 - Exposure by LLM-powered applications. While the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task, additional software built on top of the LLM could potentially streamline the process by summarizing complex legal documents, providing recommendations based on data, or retrieving specialized domain knowledge.
