1: In this task, a recreational therapist is required to encourage clients with special needs to acquire new skills and engage in health-promoting leisure activities. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be significantly expedited or improved by using the language model. The LLM could potentially assist in providing personalized recommendations for leisure activities based on the specific needs and circumstances of each client. It could also help in generating creative ideas for skill-building activities tailored to individual clients. Additionally, the LLM could aid in researching new trends in health-promoting leisure activities to keep the therapy sessions engaging and beneficial for the clients. However, the task also involves a high degree of human interaction, empathy, and understanding of individual client needs, which may not be effectively replaced by the LLM. While the LLM can provide suggestions and information, the core of the therapist's role involves building relationships and understanding the clients on a deeper level, which may not be fully achievable through text-based interactions with the model.
