1: In this task, a web developer or digital interface designer is required to perform website tests according to planned schedules or after any website or product revision. With access to the powerful OpenAI large language model (LLM), the developer could potentially automate the process of generating test cases, executing tests, and analyzing the results. The LLM could assist in creating detailed test plans, generating test scripts, and even interpreting test results to identify issues. This would significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the testing process, as manual testing can be time-consuming and prone to human error. Therefore, this task falls under E1 as the LLM can streamline the testing process and improve efficiency.
