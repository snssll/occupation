1: In this task of testing and evaluating the performance of new aircraft, the exposure to LLM can be analyzed as follows:

- **E0**: This task involves hands-on testing and evaluation of physical aircraft, which cannot be done by the LLM or any software tool. The task requires practical experience, knowledge of aviation regulations, and physical presence, making it unsuitable for automation or assistance from LLM.

- **E1**: While the LLM could potentially assist in generating reports, analyzing data, or providing information on aircraft performance based on existing data, it cannot directly test or evaluate the performance of new aircraft. The task involves practical skills and real-world testing that cannot be fully automated by the LLM.

- **E2**: It is conceivable that specialized software could be developed to assist in analyzing test data, generating reports, or providing insights based on performance metrics collected during testing. This software could leverage the LLM's capabilities to process and interpret data, but the core task of physically testing and evaluating new aircraft would still require human expertise.

- **E3**: The task does not involve image processing or analysis that would benefit significantly from additional image capabilities beyond the LLM's text-based capabilities. Therefore, exposure to image capabilities would not have a significant impact on completing this task.

Based on the analysis above, the most appropriate label for this task is **E2**.

2: E2

3: Moderate
