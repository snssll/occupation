1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of recommending shipping solutions to minimize cost or environmental impacts for Freight Forwarders, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves analyzing data, making recommendations, and potentially accessing specialized domain knowledge related to shipping and logistics.

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM can assist in analyzing data related to shipping costs and environmental impacts, generating recommendations based on input criteria, and providing insights into best practices in the freight forwarding industry. It can help in summarizing information, generating potential solutions, and even drafting reports or emails to communicate recommendations.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone can handle a significant portion of the task, additional software could be developed to enhance its capabilities further. For example, a specialized tool could be created to retrieve real-time data on shipping rates, environmental regulations, or industry trends to provide more up-to-date recommendations.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not directly relevant to this task as it primarily involves text-based data analysis and decision-making related to shipping solutions.
