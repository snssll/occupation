1: In this task, a Video Game Designer is required to guide design discussions between development teams. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it. 

- E0: This task involves guiding design discussions, which typically require human interaction, understanding of complex game design principles, and real-time collaboration with team members. The LLM, even in its most powerful form, may not be able to fully replicate the nuanced communication and decision-making processes involved in guiding such discussions. Additionally, the LLM cannot make decisions that impact human livelihood, which may be crucial in design discussions.

- E1: While the LLM could potentially provide insights, suggestions, or even generate ideas related to game design based on the input provided, it may not significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced Video Game Designer to guide design discussions between development teams. The interactive and dynamic nature of design discussions may require real-time feedback, creativity, and collaboration that the LLM alone may not be able to fully replicate.

- E2: It is conceivable that additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to assist Video Game Designers in guiding design discussions more effectively. This software could potentially analyze past design discussions, provide recommendations based on industry trends, or even facilitate virtual design collaboration platforms. Such tools could enhance the efficiency of design discussions, but they would likely require more than just the capabilities of the LLM itself.

- E3: The task of guiding design discussions does not involve image processing or creation, so the image capabilities of the LLM would not significantly impact the completion of this task.
