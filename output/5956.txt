1: In this task, the Highway Maintenance Worker is required to drive heavy equipment and vehicles to perform various maintenance activities on highways. The task involves operating machinery to sweep debris, mow grass, remove snow and ice, and spread salt and sand. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality.

Given the nature of the task, which involves physical operation of heavy equipment and vehicles, it is clear that the LLM cannot directly assist in driving or operating machinery. The task also does not involve complex decision-making that could be informed by the LLM. Therefore, the LLM or any tools built on top of it would not be able to reduce the time significantly for a Highway Maintenance Worker to complete this task.
