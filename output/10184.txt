1: In this task, a Security Management Specialist is required to monitor tapes or digital recordings to identify the source of losses. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The LLM can process text inputs and outputs, but it does not have the ability to view or analyze images or videos. Since this task involves monitoring tapes or digital recordings, which are visual inputs, the LLM alone would not be able to directly assist in completing this task. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not clearly decrease the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete the task with high quality by at least half.

2: E0

3: High
