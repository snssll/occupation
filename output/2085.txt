1: In this task, a waiter or waitress is responsible for cleaning tables or counters after patrons have finished dining. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it more efficiently.

- E0: This task involves physical interaction and manual labor, such as clearing dishes, wiping tables, and organizing dining areas. The LLM does not have the capability to perform physical tasks, so it cannot directly assist in cleaning tables or counters.

- E1: The LLM could potentially provide guidance on best practices for table cleaning, suggest efficient cleaning techniques, or help in drafting training materials for restaurant staff on table cleaning procedures. However, the actual cleaning process itself cannot be automated or significantly expedited by the LLM.

- E2: While the LLM could potentially be used to develop software that tracks table cleaning schedules, generates cleaning checklists, or provides reminders for staff, the core task of physically cleaning tables would still require human intervention. The LLM could assist in creating documentation or training materials related to table cleaning procedures.

- E3: The task of cleaning tables or counters does not involve image processing or analysis, so the image capabilities of the LLM would not significantly impact the completion of this task.

Based on the above analysis, the most appropriate label for this task is E1.

2: E1

3: Moderate
