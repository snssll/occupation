1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of expanding or modifying a system to serve new purposes or improve workflow as a Computer Systems Analyst, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be aided by the capabilities of the LLM.

- Computer Systems Analysts typically involve analyzing computer systems and processes to improve efficiency and functionality. In this task, the analyst would need to understand the current system, identify areas for improvement, and implement changes to meet new requirements or enhance workflow.
- The LLM could assist in providing insights, generating ideas for system modifications, and even helping with the documentation of the changes required.
- The LLM could be used to research best practices, industry trends, or specific technical information related to system modifications.
- While the LLM can provide valuable information and suggestions, the actual implementation of system changes would require technical expertise beyond what the LLM can offer.
