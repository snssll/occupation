1: For the task of reformatting documents by moving paragraphs or columns, the most efficient way to complete this task with equivalent quality using an LLM would involve providing specific instructions on how to reformat the document. The LLM could then generate the revised document based on these instructions, saving time compared to manually moving paragraphs or columns. This task falls under the category of "Writing and transforming text and code according to complex instructions" which is listed under E1 in the exposure rubric. Therefore, based on the nature of the task and the potential for the LLM to significantly reduce the time it takes to complete it with equivalent quality, I would assign the label E1 to this task.

2: E1

3: High
