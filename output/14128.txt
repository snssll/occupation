1: In this task, a detective or criminal investigator is required to record the progress of an investigation, maintain informational files on suspects, and submit reports to authorize warrants. With the help of the LLM, the investigator could potentially streamline the process of recording progress by dictating notes or reports, organizing and summarizing information on suspects, and even drafting initial versions of reports for submission. The LLM could assist in generating structured reports based on the input data provided by the investigator. However, the task also involves a level of critical thinking, analysis, and decision-making that the LLM may not be able to fully handle, especially when it comes to interpreting complex investigative findings and making judgment calls. Therefore, while the LLM can aid in certain aspects of the task, it may not significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced investigator to complete the entire task with high quality.
