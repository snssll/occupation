1: In this task, a Loading and Moving Machine Operator in Underground Mining directs other workers to perform specific actions such as moving stakes, placing blocks, positioning anchors or cables, or moving materials. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be completed more efficiently with the help of the LLM. Since this task involves physical actions and coordination of workers in a mining environment, it does not directly involve text-based or information processing tasks that could benefit significantly from LLM assistance. The task requires hands-on direction and supervision, which cannot be replaced by text-based AI tools. Therefore, the task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM.
