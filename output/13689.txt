1: In this task, the worker needs to read blueprints, work orders, or production schedules to determine product or job instructions or specifications. This task involves interpreting written documents to understand the requirements for a welding, soldering, or brazing job. An LLM could potentially assist by summarizing the key points from these documents, providing additional context or explanations, or even generating questions based on the information provided. However, since the task primarily involves reading and understanding technical documents, the LLM may not significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task.
