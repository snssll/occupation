1: In this task, a Nursing Assistant is required to provide information to visitors or callers, such as directions, visiting hours, or patient status information. With the help of the LLM, the assistant can easily draft responses to common inquiries, provide detailed directions, and even generate scripts for answering phone calls. The LLM can assist in formulating clear and concise responses, ensuring accuracy in the information provided. However, since the task involves human interaction and real-time communication, the LLM cannot directly interact with visitors or callers. Therefore, the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to prepare information responses but cannot fully replace the human interaction aspect of the task.
