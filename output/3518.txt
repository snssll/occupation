1: In this task, a Clinical and Counseling Psychologist is required to consult with other professionals, agencies, or universities to discuss therapies, treatments, counseling resources or techniques, and to share occupational information. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves communication, sharing information, and discussing therapies and treatments, which are primarily text-based activities. An LLM could assist in generating responses, drafting emails, summarizing information, providing feedback on documents, and potentially even suggesting therapy techniques based on the input provided. While the LLM may not have the specialized domain knowledge of a Clinical and Counseling Psychologist, it can still aid in the communication aspects of the task.
