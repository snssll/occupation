1: In this task, the Low Vision Therapists, Orientation and Mobility Specialists, and Vision Rehabilitation Therapists need to refer clients to various services to enhance visual and life functioning. To complete this task, they would need to have access to information about different services, their locations, contact details, and the specific areas of expertise they offer. An LLM could potentially assist in providing information about these services, including descriptions, reviews, and contact information, which could help the therapists make informed referrals. The LLM could also help in generating referral letters or emails based on the specific needs of the clients. Overall, the LLM could significantly reduce the time it takes to gather and organize information about services for referrals.
