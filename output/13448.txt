1: In this task, an archivist is required to provide reference services and assistance to users seeking archival materials. With access to the powerful OpenAI large language model (LLM), the archivist could potentially use the LLM to quickly search and retrieve information from archival databases, historical documents, and other sources to assist users in finding the materials they need. The LLM could also help in summarizing complex archival documents, generating responses to user queries, and even providing recommendations based on the information available. Overall, the LLM could significantly streamline the process of providing reference services and assistance for archival materials.

Considering the capabilities of the LLM in assisting with tasks related to searching, summarizing, generating responses, and providing recommendations, this task falls under the category of E1 - Direct exposure. The LLM can directly reduce the time it takes to complete the task of providing reference services and assistance for archival materials by at least half with equivalent quality.
