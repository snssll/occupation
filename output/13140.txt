1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of providing advice on best practices and implementation for selection as an Industrial-Organizational Psychologist, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could assist in completing it. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The task involves providing advice based on established best practices in the field of Industrial-Organizational Psychology. The LLM could assist in generating recommendations, summarizing research findings, and drafting reports on best practices for selection processes. The model could also help in crafting communication materials to convey these recommendations effectively.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time it takes to provide advice on best practices and implementation for selection, additional software built on top of the LLM could enhance the process. This software could include tools for analyzing large datasets related to selection processes, generating tailored recommendations based on specific organizational needs, and creating interactive training materials for implementation.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not relevant for this task as it primarily involves providing advice on best practices and implementation for selection, which is text-based and does not require image processing.
