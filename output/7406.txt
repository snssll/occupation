1: In this task, a Laundry and Dry-Cleaning Worker is required to identify articles' fabrics and original dyes by sight and touch, or by testing samples with fire or chemical reagents. This task involves a hands-on approach that requires physical interaction with the materials being tested. It also involves specialized knowledge of fabrics and dyes, which may not be easily accessible through the LLM alone. The LLM does not have the capability to physically touch or test samples with fire or chemical reagents. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not clearly decrease the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete the task with high quality by at least half.

2: E0

3: High
