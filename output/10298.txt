1: In this task, the Bridge and Lock Tenders are responsible for moving levers to activate traffic signals, navigation lights, and alarms. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality. The task itself is straightforward and does not involve complex decision-making or specialized knowledge beyond the basic understanding of operating levers. The LLM could potentially provide information on the proper procedures for activating these signals and lights, but this information is likely already covered in training materials specific to this occupation. Therefore, the task does not require any text transformation, complex analysis, or specialized knowledge that would benefit significantly from LLM access.
