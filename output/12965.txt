1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of presenting research findings as an astronomer, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM could assist in writing and transforming text by helping to draft conference presentations or journal papers based on the research findings provided by the astronomer. It could also provide feedback on the clarity and coherence of the written content, improving the overall quality of the presentation or paper.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time it takes to present research findings, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to summarize complex astronomical data, generate insights, or even assist in creating visual aids for presentations.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities would not significantly impact the task of presenting research findings in scientific conferences or journals, as the focus is primarily on written content rather than visual images.

Based on the above analysis, the task of presenting research findings as an astronomer would likely fall under E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications, as additional software leveraging the LLM's capabilities could enhance the efficiency and quality of the presentation or paper.
