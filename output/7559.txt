1: In this task, the occupation involves operating machines to shape and form products. The specific task involves igniting burners to preheat products or using torches to apply heat. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if the task can be significantly expedited or improved by using the LLM. Since this task is very hands-on and involves physical actions like igniting burners and using torches, it does not seem like the LLM can directly assist in completing the task. The LLM cannot physically ignite burners or apply heat using torches. Therefore, the task does not fall under E1, E2, or E3 as the LLM cannot reduce the time it takes to complete the task with high quality by at least half.

2: E0

3: High
