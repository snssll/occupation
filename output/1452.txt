1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of attending rehearsals and production meetings to obtain and share information related to sets as a Set and Exhibit Designer, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be facilitated by the use of a large language model (LLM).

- E0: This task involves attending rehearsals and production meetings in person, which requires physical presence and human interaction. The task does not involve text-based activities that can be significantly expedited by the LLM.

- E1: While the LLM could potentially assist in summarizing meeting notes or generating reports based on the information obtained, the core task of attending rehearsals and production meetings still heavily relies on physical presence and direct interaction, which cannot be replaced by the LLM.

- E2: It is conceivable that software could be developed to help organize and summarize information from rehearsals and meetings, but the task of attending these events and actively participating in them would still require human presence. The LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task.

- E3: The task does not involve image processing or analysis that would benefit from additional image capabilities alongside the LLM.
