1: In this task, a Park Naturalist is responsible for providing care for park program animals. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality. 

- The task of providing care for park program animals involves hands-on activities such as feeding, cleaning, and monitoring the animals' health and well-being. This task requires physical interaction and specialized knowledge about animal care, behavior, and biology.
- While the LLM can provide information and guidance on animal care practices, it cannot physically care for the animals or replace the hands-on tasks involved in this occupation.
- The LLM may be able to offer general advice or information on animal care, but the practical aspects of providing direct care to animals cannot be fully automated or replaced by text-based assistance.

Based on these considerations, the task of providing care for park program animals falls under E0 as it involves physical interaction and specialized knowledge that cannot be effectively replaced by the LLM alone.
