1: Special Education Teachers, Elementary School are responsible for preparing, administering, or grading tests and assignments to evaluate students' progress. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. In this case, the task involves creating and evaluating educational materials, which can be text-based. An LLM could potentially assist in generating test questions, providing feedback on assignments, or even summarizing student progress reports. Since the task involves working with text-based information and does not require specialized domain knowledge beyond education, the LLM could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality. Therefore, this task falls under E1 as the LLM can directly assist in writing and transforming text according to complex instructions related to educational assessments.
