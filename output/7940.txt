1: In this task, an Aircraft Structure, Surfaces, Rigging, and Systems Assembler is required to inspect or test installed units, parts, systems, or assemblies for fit, alignment, performance, defects, or compliance with standards using measuring instruments or test equipment. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The LLM can provide information, generate text, and assist in tasks that involve text-based instructions or data. However, the task of physically inspecting or testing aircraft components using measuring instruments or test equipment involves hands-on work that cannot be directly performed by the LLM. The LLM does not have the ability to physically interact with objects or perform measurements in the real world. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it cannot be significantly expedited or completed by the LLM.
