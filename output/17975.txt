1: In this task, an Advertising Sales Agent is required to write sales outlines for use by staff. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM can assist in completing it. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM can help in writing and transforming text according to complex instructions. It can generate sales outlines based on input criteria provided by the user, potentially saving time and effort for the Advertising Sales Agent.
- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not reduce the time to complete the task by half, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to summarize documents, retrieve up-to-date facts for sales outlines, or provide recommendations based on data.
- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not relevant for this task as it involves writing sales outlines and does not require image processing.

Considering the task of writing sales outlines for use by staff, the most suitable exposure label appears to be E2. While the LLM can directly assist in generating text based on input criteria, additional software could enhance the process by summarizing documents, retrieving up-to-date facts, or providing recommendations, thereby potentially reducing the time to complete the task.
