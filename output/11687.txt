1: Dermatologists perform a variety of tasks related to diagnosing and treating skin conditions. One of the tasks mentioned is performing skin surgery to improve appearance, make early diagnoses, or control diseases such as skin cancer. This task involves a high level of expertise, precision, and hands-on skills that cannot be replicated by an LLM. The task requires physical interaction with patients, precise measurements, and real-time decision-making based on visual and tactile cues. Since the task involves surgical procedures and direct patient care, it falls under the category of tasks that cannot be automated or assisted by LLMs. Therefore, this task would be classified as E0 as it does not benefit from LLM exposure.
