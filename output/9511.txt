1: In this task, a Heavy and Tractor-Trailer Truck Driver is required to maneuver trucks into loading or unloading positions based on signals from the loading crew and ensuring that the vehicle and loading equipment are correctly positioned. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if access to the LLM or LLM-powered tools can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality.

- E0: This task involves physical maneuvering of trucks, which cannot be automated by the LLM or any LLM-powered tool. The task also requires real-time interaction with the loading crew, which cannot be replaced by text-based tools.

- E1: The task does not involve writing, transforming text, or providing feedback on documents. It is a hands-on task that requires physical skills and real-time decision-making based on visual and auditory cues. The LLM cannot directly assist in completing this task.

- E2: While it is conceivable that software could be developed to assist truck drivers in maneuvering trucks more efficiently, such as through automated driving systems, this would involve complex real-world interactions and safety considerations beyond the capabilities of the LLM alone.

- E3: The task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images. The primary focus is on physical actions and interactions rather than visual or text-based tasks that could benefit from image capabilities.

2: E0
