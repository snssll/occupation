1: In this task for Ophthalmic Laboratory Technicians, the main responsibility is to mount and secure lens blanks or optical lenses in various machines for processing. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. This task involves physical manipulation of objects (lens blanks or optical lenses) and operating machinery, which cannot be directly assisted by an LLM. The task does not involve text input or output, complex instructions, data analysis, or decision-making based on information that an LLM could provide. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM.
