1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of identifying appropriate Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and reporting key metrics from digital campaigns as a Search Marketing Strategist, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves analyzing data from digital campaigns and selecting relevant KPIs, which requires domain-specific knowledge and expertise in digital marketing.

- E0: This task does not involve any direct text-based input or output that can be significantly enhanced by the LLM. The task is more focused on data analysis and decision-making based on domain expertise rather than text generation or transformation.

- E1: While the LLM could potentially assist in generating reports or summaries based on the data provided, the core task of selecting appropriate KPIs and interpreting key metrics relies heavily on domain knowledge and expertise in digital marketing. The LLM may not be able to provide the specialized insights needed for this task.

- E2: It is conceivable that additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to help streamline the process of analyzing digital campaign data and suggesting relevant KPIs. This software could potentially automate certain aspects of data analysis and reporting, but the task still heavily relies on the expertise of the Search Marketing Strategist.

- E3: The task does not involve image capabilities, so exposure to LLM and image capabilities would not significantly impact the completion of this task.
