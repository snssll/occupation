1: In this task, a Glazier is responsible for preparing the work site by moving furniture and covering floors or furnishings with drop cloths to protect them during the glass installation process. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task and whether the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete it with high quality.

- The task involves physical labor, such as moving furniture, which cannot be directly assisted by the LLM.
- The task does not involve complex text input or output that the LLM could assist with.
- There are no specific instructions, complex decisions, or specialized knowledge required that the LLM could provide.

Based on these considerations, it is clear that the task of moving furniture and covering floors for Glaziers does not align with any of the exposure labels provided. The task is physical in nature and does not involve text-based instructions or decision-making that the LLM could assist with.
