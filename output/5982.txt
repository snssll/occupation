1: In this task, the occupation is Driver/Sales Workers, and the specific task mentioned is driving trucks to deliver items. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete the task with high quality by at least half.

- E0: This task involves physical driving of trucks, which cannot be automated by the LLM or any software tool. The task requires real-time decision-making, navigation, and interaction with the physical environment, making it unsuitable for automation by the LLM.

- E1: The task of driving trucks to deliver items is highly practical and involves real-world skills that cannot be directly replaced by the LLM. While the LLM could potentially assist with route planning or communication aspects of the job, the core task of physically driving the truck cannot be significantly impacted by the LLM alone.

- E2: While the LLM could potentially be used to develop software tools for route optimization, communication scripts, or documentation purposes related to the task, the direct impact on reducing the time it takes to complete the task by half is not feasible. The task involves a significant physical component that cannot be automated by the LLM alone.

- E3: The task of driving trucks does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images. Therefore, the image capabilities of the LLM would not significantly impact the completion time of this task.
