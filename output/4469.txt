1: In this task of designing sludge treatment plants as a Water/Wastewater Engineer, the use of the most powerful OpenAI large language model (LLM) could potentially fall under E2 exposure. While the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task by at least half, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to streamline the design process. This software could potentially assist in generating initial design concepts, providing recommendations based on data input, or even analyzing complex data related to sludge treatment processes. The LLM could be used to access and summarize relevant information, but the task itself involves specialized domain knowledge and technical expertise that may not be fully covered by the LLM alone.
