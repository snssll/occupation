1: In this task, a security guard is responsible for monitoring and adjusting controls that regulate building systems like air conditioning, furnace, or boiler. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes for a security guard to complete this task with high quality.

- E0: This task involves physical monitoring and adjustment of building systems, which cannot be done through text input and output alone. The task requires hands-on interaction and precise adjustments, making it unsuitable for automation using the LLM.
- E1: While the LLM could potentially provide information on how to monitor and adjust building systems, the actual physical actions required for this task cannot be performed by the LLM. Therefore, the LLM alone cannot reduce the time it takes to complete this task by at least half.
- E2: Developing software on top of the LLM that could remotely control building systems based on text input might be possible, but it would require specialized hardware and integration with the building's systems. This additional software could potentially reduce the time it takes to complete the task by half.
- E3: The LLM, combined with image capabilities, could potentially assist in providing visual instructions or diagrams related to building systems. However, this task primarily involves physical adjustments rather than visual information, so the image capabilities may not significantly reduce the time to complete the task.
