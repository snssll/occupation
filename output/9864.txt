1: In this task, a file clerk is responsible for modifying or improving filing systems or implementing new filing systems. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- File clerks typically work with organizing and managing physical or digital files, which involves a significant amount of manual work.
- The task of modifying or improving filing systems requires understanding the current system, identifying areas for enhancement, and implementing changes effectively.
- While the task involves some level of decision-making and organization, it primarily revolves around manual labor and practical knowledge of filing systems.

Considering these points, it is unlikely that direct access to an LLM would significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task. The task is more hands-on and practical, involving physical or digital organization that may not benefit substantially from the capabilities of an LLM.
