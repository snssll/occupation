1: In this task, an Orthotist or Prosthetist is required to examine, interview, and measure patients to determine their appliance needs and identify factors that could affect appliance fit. With access to the LLM, the Orthotist or Prosthetist could potentially use the model to assist in documenting patient information, generating reports, or even researching new developments in orthotics and prosthetics. The LLM could help in summarizing patient histories, generating standardized interview questions, or providing information on the latest advancements in the field. However, the task itself involves physical measurements and direct interaction with patients, which cannot be fully replaced by the LLM. While the LLM could assist in some aspects of the task, such as documentation and research, it cannot perform the essential hands-on examination and measurement required in this occupation.
