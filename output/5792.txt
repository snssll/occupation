1: In this task, an Animal Caretaker is responsible for cleaning and maintaining animal quarters and equipment. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if the task can be significantly expedited or improved by using the LLM. The task involves physical cleaning and organization, which cannot be directly assisted by the LLM. While the LLM could potentially provide information on the best cleaning practices or suggest disinfectants, the core task of physically cleaning and organizing cannot be automated by the LLM. Therefore, the task does not fall under E1, E2, or E3 as it does not involve text input or output, specialized knowledge retrieval, or image capabilities.

2: E0

3: High
