1: In this task, a Sales Representative is required to contact regular and prospective customers to demonstrate products, explain product features, and solicit orders. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The task involves communication with customers, which can be facilitated by the LLM in drafting emails, product descriptions, or responses to inquiries. The LLM can assist in generating effective communication scripts or product information.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM can help in drafting communication, it may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task by half. However, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to streamline customer interactions, track customer preferences, or provide personalized product recommendations.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not relevant to this task as it primarily involves verbal communication with customers and does not require image processing.

Based on the above analysis, the task of contacting regular and prospective customers to demonstrate products, explain product features, and solicit orders aligns best with E1: Direct exposure to the LLM.
