1: In this task, a Transportation Security Screener is required to locate suspicious bags pictured in printouts sent from remote monitoring areas and set these bags aside for inspection. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves visual identification of suspicious bags in printouts, which requires human judgment and decision-making based on visual cues. While an LLM could potentially assist in providing general information on identifying suspicious items, it lacks the ability to view images or printouts to locate specific bags. As a result, this task does not fall under E1, E2, or E3 categories as it involves a high degree of human interaction and visual identification that cannot be effectively performed by an LLM.
