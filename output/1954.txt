1: In this task, the Weatherization Installers and Technicians are responsible for cleaning and maintaining tools and equipment. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality. Since this task involves physical actions such as cleaning and maintaining tools and equipment, it does not directly involve text input or output that the LLM can assist with. The task also does not involve complex decision-making or analysis that the LLM could contribute to. Therefore, this task does not align with any of the exposure labels provided.
