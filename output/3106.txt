1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of conducting social research to advance knowledge in the social work field as a Healthcare Social Worker, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. In this task, the LLM can assist in various ways such as providing information on research methodologies, summarizing existing research studies, generating potential research questions, and even helping in drafting research proposals. The LLM can also assist in analyzing data and providing insights based on the information provided.
