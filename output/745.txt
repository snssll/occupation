1: In this task, a Library Technician is required to answer routine telephone or in-person reference inquiries and refer patrons to librarians for further assistance when necessary. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- E0: This task involves direct human interaction and judgment in determining when to refer patrons to librarians. The LLM cannot make decisions that impact human livelihood, and it cannot handle in-person interactions. Therefore, using the LLM would not significantly reduce the time it takes for a Library Technician to complete this task.

- E1: While the LLM could potentially assist in drafting responses to routine inquiries, it cannot handle in-person interactions or make the judgment calls necessary to refer patrons to librarians. The task involves a level of human interaction and decision-making that the LLM cannot fully replicate.

- E2: It is conceivable that additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to help with answering routine inquiries by providing suggested responses based on common queries. However, the task still involves human judgment in determining when to escalate inquiries to librarians, which the LLM alone cannot handle.

- E3: The task does not involve image capabilities, so this exposure level does not apply.

2: E0

3: High
