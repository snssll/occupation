1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of "Market or promote the casino to bring in business" for Gambling Managers in terms of exposure to LLM, we need to consider the nature of the task. This task involves creating strategies and campaigns to attract customers to a casino. An LLM could potentially assist in generating ideas for marketing campaigns, drafting promotional materials, analyzing customer data to target specific demographics, and providing insights on effective marketing techniques.

- E1: Direct exposure - If the task involves writing marketing copy, generating campaign ideas, or analyzing customer data, the LLM could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete these subtasks with equivalent quality by providing suggestions, insights, and content generation.
- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not reduce the time by half for this task, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to automate market research, competitor analysis, and campaign optimization, thereby enhancing the efficiency of the overall marketing process.
- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities would not significantly impact the task of marketing or promoting a casino, as the primary focus is on text-based content creation, data analysis, and strategy development.
