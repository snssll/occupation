1: In this task, the Morticians, Undertakers, and Funeral Arrangers are required to perform embalming duties when necessary. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality. 

- The task of performing embalming duties involves a high level of hands-on, practical skills that cannot be directly replaced by text-based instructions or responses from the LLM.
- Embalming requires precise measurements, knowledge of anatomy, and physical manipulation of the body, which are not tasks that can be completed through text-based interactions with the LLM.
- The LLM does not have the capability to physically perform embalming duties or provide real-time guidance for such a task.
- While the LLM could potentially provide information on embalming techniques or guidelines, the practical application of embalming duties would still require physical presence and expertise beyond what the LLM can offer.

Based on these considerations, the task of performing embalming duties for Morticians, Undertakers, and Funeral Arrangers would be classified as E0 - No exposure.
