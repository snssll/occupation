1: In this task, a Merchandise Displayer and Window Trimmer is responsible for installing booths, exhibits, displays, carpets, or drapes according to a floor plan or specific instructions. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if the task can be significantly expedited or improved by using the LLM. 

- The task involves physical installation work, which cannot be directly assisted by the LLM.
- The task requires following specific instructions and floor plans, which do not necessarily benefit from the text-based capabilities of the LLM.
- The LLM does not have the ability to physically handle materials like booths, exhibits, carpets, or drapes.

Based on these considerations, it is clear that the task of installing booths, exhibits, displays, carpets, or drapes as guided by a floor plan does not align with any of the exposure levels in the rubric. The task is not text-based, and the LLM cannot directly assist in the physical installation process.
