1: In this task, a Home Appliance Repairer needs to communicate with customers or refer to work orders to understand the issues with appliances. With access to the powerful OpenAI large language model (LLM), the repairer could potentially use the model to assist in understanding complex technical issues, troubleshooting problems, or even generating responses to common appliance malfunctions based on the information provided by customers or work orders. The LLM could help in summarizing technical manuals, providing troubleshooting steps, or suggesting possible solutions based on the symptoms described. This task involves text input (customer descriptions or work orders) and text output (understanding appliance malfunctions), which the LLM is well-equipped to handle. Therefore, this task falls under E1 as the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to understand appliance malfunctions and provide relevant information.
