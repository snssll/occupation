1: In this task, a Digital Forensics Analyst needs to adhere to legal policies and procedures related to handling digital media. The task involves understanding and applying complex legal regulations and guidelines to ensure the proper handling of digital evidence. The LLM can assist in providing information on current legal policies and procedures related to digital forensics, as well as help in interpreting and summarizing legal documents. The model can also generate sample procedures or guidelines based on the input provided.
