1: In this task, a makeup artist working in theatrical and performance settings needs to study production information to determine makeup requirements. With access to the LLM, the artist could potentially use the model to assist in researching character descriptions, period settings, and other relevant information to inform their makeup decisions. The LLM could help in summarizing and providing additional context on the characters, settings, and situations mentioned in the production information. It could also assist in generating ideas for makeup designs based on the provided details. However, since this task involves a significant amount of creativity, interpretation, and practical application of makeup skills, the LLM alone may not be able to reduce the time it takes to complete the task by at least half. While the LLM could provide information and suggestions, the actual makeup application and artistic decisions would still heavily rely on the expertise and creativity of the makeup artist.
