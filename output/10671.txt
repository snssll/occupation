1: In this task, the occupation involves locksmiths and safe repairers, who are responsible for opening safe locks by drilling. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be impacted by the capabilities of the LLM. 

- E0: This task involves physical work that cannot be automated by the LLM. Opening safe locks by drilling requires hands-on skills and precise actions that cannot be replicated by a language model alone. Therefore, this task does not benefit from LLM capabilities.

- E1: While the LLM could potentially provide information on safe lock mechanisms or general locksmithing techniques, it cannot physically open a safe lock by drilling. The task is highly practical and requires manual intervention, making it unsuitable for direct LLM assistance.

- E2: It is challenging to imagine additional software that could be developed on top of the LLM to automate the physical act of opening safe locks by drilling. This task is inherently hands-on and does not lend itself to automation through software tools.

- E3: The task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images. It is purely a physical task that cannot be enhanced by image capabilities.

Based on the analysis above, the most appropriate label for this task is E0.

2: E0

3: High
