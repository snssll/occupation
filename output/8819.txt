1: In this task, the main activity involves physically lifting workpieces onto work tables, either manually or with the help of hoists or crane operators. This task is primarily physical in nature and requires manual labor. The task does not involve complex decision-making, analysis, or information processing that could benefit from the capabilities of a large language model (LLM). Therefore, there is no direct exposure of the task to LLM as it cannot assist in physical tasks like lifting workpieces.
