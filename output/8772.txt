1: In this task, a teaching assistant in a postsecondary setting is required to lead discussion sections, tutorials, or laboratory sections. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. Leading discussions, tutorials, or laboratory sections involves interacting with students, facilitating learning, answering questions, providing guidance, and assessing student understanding. These activities require human interaction, real-time feedback, and the ability to adapt to students' needs and responses. While an LLM could potentially assist in preparing materials for these sessions, providing information, or generating content, the core aspect of leading these sections involves interpersonal skills, pedagogical knowledge, and real-time engagement, which are not easily replicable by an LLM. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it involves a high degree of human interaction and cannot be significantly expedited by the use of an LLM.
