1: In this task, a Loan Officer is responsible for submitting applications to credit analysts for verification and recommendation. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. Loan Officers typically handle a significant amount of paperwork and documentation related to loan applications. The task involves processing and submitting applications, which may require understanding financial information, assessing creditworthiness, and ensuring compliance with lending regulations.

Given that the task involves processing text-based information (loan applications) and making submissions based on specific criteria (verification and recommendation to credit analysts), it is likely that access to an LLM could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task. The LLM could assist in summarizing key information from loan applications, generating reports, providing insights on creditworthiness, and even drafting submission emails to credit analysts.

Considering the potential for the LLM to streamline the process of reviewing and submitting loan applications, I would classify this task as E1 - Direct exposure.

2: E1

3: Moderate
