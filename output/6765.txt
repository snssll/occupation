1: In this task, the athlete or sports competitor is required to exercise or practice under the guidance of trainers or coaches to enhance skills, improve physical fitness, or get ready for competitions. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves following specific instructions provided by trainers or coaches, which can be translated into text input for the LLM. The LLM can assist in generating workout plans, practice routines, or strategies based on the input provided. It can also help in summarizing training techniques, providing feedback on performance, or even generating questions related to training sessions. However, the task does not involve complex data analysis, highly specialized domain knowledge, or the need for image capabilities. Therefore, the task falls under E1 as the LLM can significantly reduce the time required to complete the task by providing text-based assistance and generating relevant content.
