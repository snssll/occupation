1: In this task, an animal trainer is required to place tack or harnesses on horses to help them get used to the feel of the equipment. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes for an animal trainer to complete this task with high quality. Since this task involves physical interaction with animals and requires hands-on work, it is unlikely that the LLM or any tool built on top of it can effectively assist in completing this task. The LLM cannot physically interact with animals or perform tasks that require physical dexterity. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not benefit from the capabilities of the LLM.

2: E0

3: High
