1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of measuring and analyzing system performance for Solar Photovoltaic Installers, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be aided by the use of a large language model (LLM).

- Solar Photovoltaic Installers typically need to collect data on system performance and operating parameters to assess the condition of solar energy systems. This task involves analyzing data and making assessments based on the information gathered.
- An LLM could potentially assist in providing guidance on how to measure and analyze system performance, offering insights on best practices, data analysis techniques, and potential issues to look out for.
- The LLM could also help in interpreting complex data sets, providing explanations for certain trends or anomalies in the system performance data.
- While the LLM may not directly measure system performance (as it requires physical data collection), it can significantly aid in the analysis and interpretation of the data collected by Solar Photovoltaic Installers.

Based on these considerations, the task of measuring and analyzing system performance for Solar Photovoltaic Installers could be classified as E2 - Exposure by LLM-powered applications. While the LLM alone may not reduce the time it takes to physically measure system performance, additional software built on top of the LLM could streamline the data analysis process and provide valuable insights.
