1: In this task, the goal is to train demonstrators to present a company's products or services. This involves providing instructions, guidance, and possibly demonstrations to ensure that the demonstrators effectively showcase the products or services to potential customers. To complete this task, the LLM could potentially assist in generating training materials, scripts, or guidelines for the demonstrators. The LLM could also help in creating interactive training modules or simulations to enhance the training process. However, the task also requires hands-on training, observation, and feedback, which may not be fully replaceable by the LLM alone. While the LLM can provide valuable resources and information, the actual training and interaction with demonstrators may still require human involvement.
