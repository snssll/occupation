1: In this task, a Gambling Surveillance Officer or Investigator acts as oversight or security agents for management or customers in a gambling establishment. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality. 

- E0: This task involves physical surveillance and security measures that require human presence and interaction. The LLM cannot physically oversee or provide security in a gambling establishment.
- E1: While the LLM can provide information and insights related to gambling regulations, trends, or best practices, it cannot physically act as a surveillance officer or investigator. The task of physically overseeing and providing security would still require human intervention.
- E2: It is conceivable that software could be developed on top of the LLM to analyze data related to gambling activities, flag suspicious behavior, or provide recommendations based on patterns detected. However, the physical aspect of acting as oversight or security agents would still require human involvement.
- E3: The task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images, so the image capabilities of the LLM are not directly relevant to this task.

Based on the above analysis, the most appropriate label for this task is E0.

2: E0

3: High
