1: In this task, a courier or messenger unloads goods from large trucks and loads them onto smaller delivery vehicles. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone or with additional software could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality.

- E0: This task involves physical labor, such as unloading and loading goods, which cannot be automated by the LLM or any software tool. It requires human interaction and physical movement, making it unsuitable for automation using the LLM.
