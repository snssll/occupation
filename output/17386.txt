1: In this task, a Computer Systems Analyst is required to troubleshoot program and system malfunctions to restore normal functioning. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves analyzing and diagnosing issues related to computer systems and programs, which can benefit from the LLM's ability to provide information, explanations, and potential solutions based on the input provided.
- The LLM can assist in generating troubleshooting steps, suggesting possible causes of malfunctions, and providing insights into common issues related to computer systems.
- While the LLM may not directly reduce the time it takes to troubleshoot a specific issue, it can enhance the analyst's knowledge base and provide additional perspectives that could aid in problem-solving.
- The task does not involve detailed visual analysis or physical interactions, making it suitable for text-based assistance from the LLM.

Based on these considerations, the task of troubleshooting program and system malfunctions as a Computer Systems Analyst would likely fall under the E1 label. The LLM can provide valuable information, explanations, and potential solutions to assist in the troubleshooting process, ultimately improving the quality and efficiency of the analyst's work.
