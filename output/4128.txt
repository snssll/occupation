1: In this task, a Control and Valve Installer and Repairer is required to cut seats to receive new orifices, tap inspection ports, and perform other repairs using hand tools and machine tools. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be completed more efficiently with the help of the LLM. Since this task involves physical work with hand tools and machine tools, it does not directly involve text input or output that the LLM can assist with. The task requires manual skills and technical knowledge related to repairing valves and control systems, which are not within the capabilities of the LLM. Therefore, the task does not fall under E1, E2, or E3 exposure levels.

2: E0

3: High
