1: In this task, the occupation of Tire Builders involves filling cuts and holes in tires using hot rubber. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality. 

- E0: This task involves a physical, hands-on process that cannot be automated by the LLM or any software tools. The task requires manual dexterity and working with hot rubber, which cannot be replicated by text-based AI models.
- E1: The LLM could potentially provide information on best practices for filling cuts and holes in tires, safety precautions, or alternative materials to use. It could also assist in generating written instructions or documentation related to this task. However, the actual physical task of filling cuts and holes with hot rubber cannot be directly performed by the LLM.
- E2: While the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task, it is conceivable that additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to provide virtual simulations or training modules for Tire Builders. This software could offer interactive guides, safety tips, and troubleshooting advice related to filling cuts and holes in tires.
- E3: The task does not involve image processing or detailed visual instructions that would require additional image capabilities beyond the LLM's text-based capabilities.
