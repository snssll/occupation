1: For the task of preparing for trial by organizing exhibits as a Paralegal or Legal Assistant, the exposure to LLM can be evaluated as follows:

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM can assist in organizing exhibits by providing templates, guidelines, or suggestions on how to efficiently organize and present exhibits for trial. It can also help in drafting descriptions or labels for exhibits. The LLM can streamline the process of organizing exhibits by generating lists, categorizing items, or even suggesting the most effective ways to present evidence. Overall, the LLM can significantly reduce the time and effort required to organize exhibits for trial.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone can provide some assistance in organizing exhibits, additional software could be developed to enhance this process further. For example, specialized software could be created that integrates with the LLM to automatically categorize exhibits based on legal requirements, generate exhibit logs, or even cross-reference exhibits with relevant case law. Such software could further streamline the organization process and provide more advanced features tailored to legal proceedings.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities would not significantly impact the task of organizing exhibits for trial, as it primarily involves textual and organizational work rather than detailed image processing or analysis.
