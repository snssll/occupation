1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of performing administrative and management functions related to the practice of law as a lawyer, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. In this case, the task involves handling various administrative tasks within a legal practice, such as managing documents, schedules, client communications, and other operational aspects. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM can assist in writing and transforming text, providing edits, summarizing documents, answering questions, and maintaining records. It can help with drafting emails, preparing training materials, and informing individuals via written communication. However, the task of performing administrative and management functions in a legal setting may involve a level of complexity and domain-specific knowledge that goes beyond what the LLM can handle independently. While the LLM can assist with some aspects of this task, it may not significantly reduce the time needed to complete it with equivalent quality.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While it is conceivable that additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to streamline certain administrative functions within a legal practice, such as document management or client communication, the complexity and specificity of legal operations may require highly specialized domain knowledge that the LLM alone may not possess. Therefore, while there is potential for software applications to be built on top of the LLM to aid in these tasks, the current capabilities of the LLM may not be sufficient to significantly reduce the time needed to complete the task.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities would not significantly impact the completion of administrative and management functions related to the practice of law, as these tasks primarily involve text-based documents, communication, and operational aspects rather than image processing.
