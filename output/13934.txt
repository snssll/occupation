1: In this task, an Order Clerk is required to recommend merchandise or services that will meet customers' needs. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we can break down the task as follows:

- The task involves understanding customer needs and preferences, which may require some level of human judgment and empathy.
- The task also involves knowledge of the merchandise or services offered by the company, which may require domain-specific knowledge.
- The task does not involve complex data analysis or specialized knowledge retrieval beyond what the LLM can provide.

Based on these considerations, the task does not clearly benefit from direct access to the LLM through an interface like ChatGPT, as it requires a level of human judgment and domain-specific knowledge that the LLM may not possess. Additionally, while it is conceivable that additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to assist with recommending merchandise or services, the task's reliance on human judgment and empathy makes it less likely that such software could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task.
