1: In this task, a gambling dealer is responsible for receiving, verifying, and recording patrons' cash wagers. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if access to the LLM or LLM-powered tools can significantly reduce the time it takes for a gambling dealer to complete this task with high quality.

- E0: This task involves physical interaction with patrons, handling cash, and verifying wagers, which are activities that cannot be automated by the LLM. Additionally, legal regulations likely require human involvement in these processes. Therefore, the task is not suitable for automation using the LLM.

- E1: While the LLM could potentially assist in generating documentation related to wagers or providing information on gambling regulations, the core task of physically receiving and verifying cash wagers cannot be effectively automated by the LLM alone. The task involves real-time interactions and physical actions that require human judgment and verification.

- E2: Developing software on top of the LLM that could potentially assist in summarizing gambling regulations, providing real-time alerts on wager limits, or generating reports related to wagers might be possible. However, the core task of physically handling cash wagers and verifying them would still require human involvement.

- E3: The task does not involve image processing or detailed visual analysis that would benefit from additional image capabilities. Therefore, exposure to image capabilities would not significantly impact the completion of this task.
