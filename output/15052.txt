1: In this task, a Human Factors Engineer or Ergonomist is required to review health, safety, accident, or worker compensation records to evaluate safety program effectiveness or to identify jobs with a high incidence of injury. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves reviewing records, which can be a text-based activity.
- The task requires analyzing and evaluating information from these records to draw conclusions about safety program effectiveness and injury rates.
- The task does not involve precise measurements or detailed visuals that would require physical interaction.
- The task relies on data analysis and interpretation, which can be supported by an LLM to extract insights and provide recommendations based on the information provided.

Based on these considerations, the task can benefit from the capabilities of an LLM to assist in analyzing and interpreting the records, making it suitable for an exposure label.
