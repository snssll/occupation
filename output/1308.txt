1: In this task, the Occupational Therapy Aides assist occupational therapists in planning, implementing, and administering therapy programs. This involves activities such as restoring, reinforcing, and enhancing performance using selected activities and special equipment. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be significantly aided by the use of the language model. The LLM could potentially assist in providing information on therapy techniques, equipment usage, and program planning. It could also help in generating reports, summarizing patient progress, or even suggesting alternative therapy approaches based on the input provided. However, since this task involves hands-on assistance, physical activities, and direct interaction with patients, the LLM's assistance may be limited to providing information and suggestions rather than directly performing the tasks. Therefore, the task falls under E2 as additional software could be developed to aid in summarizing patient progress, suggesting therapy techniques, or providing recommendations based on data input.
