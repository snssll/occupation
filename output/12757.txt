1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of preparing requests for proposals or statements of work as a biologist, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it. 

- Biologists typically need to write detailed and specific documents outlining the requirements for research projects, collaborations, or contracts. This task involves a significant amount of text generation and structuring to clearly communicate the objectives, scope, and expectations of the proposed work.
- The LLM can assist in generating and refining the text for these documents based on the biologist's input, helping to ensure clarity, coherence, and completeness in the proposals or statements of work.
- The LLM can also provide suggestions for key elements to include, help with formatting, and offer language improvements to enhance the overall quality of the documents.

Based on these considerations, the task of preparing requests for proposals or statements of work as a biologist could be classified as E1 - Direct exposure. The LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task by providing text generation and editing support, resulting in equivalent quality output.
