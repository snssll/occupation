1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of participating in multidisciplinary projects in areas such as virtual reality, human-computer interaction, or robotics as a Computer and Information Research Scientist, we need to consider the exposure to LLM.

- E1: Direct exposure - If the task involves writing reports, analyzing data, providing feedback, or any other text-based activities related to the multidisciplinary projects, the LLM could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete these tasks with equivalent quality. The LLM can assist in generating text, summarizing information, and providing insights based on the input data.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not reduce the time to complete the task by half, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to summarize research papers, retrieve up-to-date information on virtual reality, human-computer interaction, or robotics, and provide recommendations based on the data analyzed in the projects.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Since the task does not explicitly involve working with images, reading text from PDFs, or creating/editing digital images, the image capabilities of the LLM are not directly relevant to this task.

Based on the above considerations, the task of participating in multidisciplinary projects in areas such as virtual reality, human-computer interaction, or robotics would likely fall under **E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications**.
