1: In this task, a Traffic Technician is required to develop plans or long-range strategies for providing adequate parking space. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. Since this task involves strategic planning and decision-making based on various factors such as traffic flow, urban development, and regulations, it requires human judgment, critical thinking, and domain-specific knowledge. While an LLM can provide information on general concepts related to parking space management, it may not have access to specific local regulations, urban planning data, or real-time traffic information needed to create effective long-range strategies. Therefore, the task falls under E0 as it involves decision-making that requires human expertise and access to specialized knowledge beyond what the LLM can provide.
