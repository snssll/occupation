1: In this task, a Computer Network Support Specialist is required to configure security settings or access permissions for groups or individuals. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves working with technical information related to computer networks, which may require specific domain knowledge.
- The task is focused on configuring security settings and access permissions, which may involve understanding complex systems and protocols.
- While the task involves technical expertise, it primarily revolves around text-based instructions and configurations.

Based on these considerations, the task falls under E2 - Exposure by LLM-powered applications. Although the LLM alone may not reduce the time significantly for this task, additional software built on top of the LLM could streamline the process by providing recommendations, analyzing information, or retrieving specialized domain knowledge related to network security.
