1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of employing financial models as a Financial and Investment Analyst, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be supported by the capabilities of the LLM.

- Financial modeling involves complex calculations, scenario analysis, and forecasting based on historical data and assumptions. The LLM can assist in generating text-based explanations, providing insights, and potentially even generating parts of the financial models based on the input data and requirements.
- The task does not involve precise measurements or detailed visuals that would require direct human interaction or physical manipulation.
- While the LLM can assist in writing and transforming text, providing insights, and potentially even generating parts of financial models, it may not significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced analyst to complete the task with high quality. The task requires specialized financial knowledge and expertise that the LLM alone may not possess.
- It is conceivable that additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to enhance its capabilities for financial modeling tasks, such as integrating with financial databases, performing more advanced calculations, or providing real-time market data analysis.

Based on these considerations, the task of employing financial models as a Financial and Investment Analyst would likely fall under label E2 - Exposure by LLM-powered applications.
