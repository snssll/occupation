1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of promoting the university by participating in events and developing partnerships, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves a significant amount of human interaction, networking, and relationship-building, which are not easily replicable by an LLM. While the LLM can assist in drafting communication materials or providing information about the university, the core activities of attending events, engaging with stakeholders, and fostering partnerships require human presence and decision-making. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not significantly benefit from LLM capabilities.

2: E0
