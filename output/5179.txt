1: In this task, a Geographic Information Systems (GIS) Technologist or Technician is required to develop specialized computer software routines, internet-based GIS databases, or business applications to customize geographic information. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider the complexity of the task and whether the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete it with equivalent quality. 

- Developing specialized computer software routines may involve writing code, which the LLM can assist with by providing code snippets, explanations, or even generating code based on specific requirements.
- Creating internet-based GIS databases may involve structuring data, designing interfaces, and integrating various components, which the LLM can help with by providing guidance, suggestions, or even generating parts of the database structure.
- Customizing business applications for geographic information may involve understanding user requirements, data analysis, and software development, which the LLM can assist with by providing insights, recommendations, or even generating parts of the application logic.

Considering the nature of the task and the LLM's capabilities in assisting with writing code, providing guidance, and generating content, this task falls under E1 as the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality.
