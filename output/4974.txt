1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of developing new recipes for baked goods as a baker, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The LLM can assist in providing recipe ideas, suggesting ingredient combinations, and offering guidance on baking techniques. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM can help in generating new recipe ideas, providing ingredient suggestions, and offering detailed instructions on baking techniques. This can significantly reduce the time it takes for a baker to come up with new recipes, as the LLM can provide inspiration and guidance throughout the recipe development process.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone can assist in generating new recipe ideas, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to further streamline the recipe development process. This software could include features like analyzing existing recipes, incorporating user preferences, and generating variations based on feedback.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not directly relevant to the task of developing new recipes for baked goods, as it primarily involves text-based instructions and ingredient lists rather than visual content.
