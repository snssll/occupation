1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of repairing or replacing broken components of machinery or equipment as an Industrial Machinery Mechanic, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it.

- E1: Direct exposure - The task involves a practical, hands-on aspect of physically repairing or replacing components of machinery. While the LLM could potentially provide guidance on troubleshooting or repair procedures through text instructions, it cannot physically perform the repair or replacement itself. Therefore, the direct use of the LLM would not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not directly reduce the time to complete the task, it is conceivable that additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to provide interactive repair guides, troubleshooting tips, or access to specialized knowledge databases related to industrial machinery. Such tools could potentially enhance the efficiency of the repair process by providing quick access to relevant information.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - The task of repairing machinery may involve referencing technical diagrams, schematics, or images of components. If the LLM were integrated with image capabilities that could assist in identifying parts or providing visual aids for repair procedures, it could potentially streamline the repair process by offering visual guidance.
