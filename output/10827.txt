1: In this task, a Lighting Technician operates lighting systems during productions. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes for a Lighting Technician to operate manual or automated lighting systems. Since this task involves hands-on work and real-time adjustments during productions, it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM, which is primarily text-based and does not have the ability to physically control lighting systems. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not benefit from the use of the LLM.

2: E0

3: High
