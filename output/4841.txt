1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of developing core analytical capabilities or model libraries as a Financial Quantitative Analyst, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be impacted by the use of the LLM.

- Financial Quantitative Analysts typically require a deep understanding of advanced statistical, quantitative, and econometric techniques to develop analytical models. This task involves a high level of expertise and specialized knowledge in the field of finance and quantitative analysis.
- While the LLM can assist in generating text, providing information, and even basic analysis, the task of developing core analytical capabilities or model libraries requires more than just text generation. It involves complex mathematical and statistical computations, as well as domain-specific knowledge that may not be readily available in the LLM.
- The LLM may be able to provide some general information or insights related to financial analysis, but it is unlikely to have the specialized knowledge and expertise required to develop advanced analytical models specific to the field of finance.

Based on these considerations, the task of developing core analytical capabilities or model libraries as a Financial Quantitative Analyst would likely fall under E0 as it requires specialized domain knowledge and expertise that goes beyond the capabilities of the LLM.
