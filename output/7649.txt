1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of informing customers about foreign currency regulations and computing transaction fees for currency exchanges as a teller, we need to consider the nature of the task and the potential impact of using an LLM.

- This task involves providing information to customers about foreign currency regulations, which may require accessing up-to-date information. The LLM can assist in generating accurate and detailed explanations based on the input provided.
- Additionally, computing transaction fees for currency exchanges involves calculations that the LLM can easily perform, saving time and reducing the potential for errors.
