1: In this task, a First-Line Supervisor of Retail Sales Workers is responsible for keeping records of purchases, sales, and requisitions. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves maintaining records, which can be done efficiently by an LLM through text input and output. The LLM can assist in organizing and summarizing data related to purchases, sales, and requisitions.
- The task does not require specialized domain knowledge or complex databases beyond what the LLM can handle with text-based information.
- The task does not involve image capabilities, as it primarily deals with text-based records.
- While the task may not be directly reducible to half the time with just the LLM, it is easy to imagine additional software that could be developed on top of the LLM to automate record-keeping processes further.

Considering these points, the task of keeping records of purchases, sales, and requisitions for First-Line Supervisors of Retail Sales Workers would fall under label E2 - Exposure by LLM-powered applications.
