1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of administering document and system access rights and revision control as a Document Management Specialist, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it. 

- Document and system access rights management involves setting permissions, restrictions, and controls on who can view, edit, or delete documents within a system. This task requires understanding security protocols, compliance regulations, and organizational policies.
- Revision control ensures that changes to documents are tracked, recorded, and managed effectively to maintain the integrity of master documents. This involves versioning, tracking changes, and ensuring proper documentation of revisions.

Given the complexity and specificity of this task, it is unlikely that the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete it by at least half. While the LLM could potentially assist in generating documentation or providing general information on best practices, the task itself requires a deep understanding of security protocols and document management practices that may not be effectively addressed by the LLM alone.
