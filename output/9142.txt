1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of maintaining files as a Production, Planning, and Expediting Clerk, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be impacted by the use of an LLM. In this task, the main responsibilities involve organizing and managing various types of records and documents related to production, planning, and expediting activities. The task requires attention to detail, accuracy, and organization skills.

- E1: Direct exposure - If the LLM can assist in organizing and managing files, such as providing templates for record-keeping, suggesting efficient ways to categorize documents, or automating certain aspects of file maintenance, then the task could be completed more efficiently with equivalent quality by using the LLM directly.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time it takes to maintain files, it is conceivable that additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to streamline file organization, retrieval, and management. This software could potentially offer advanced features like intelligent search functions, automated data entry, or integration with other systems to enhance file maintenance processes.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Since the task of maintaining files primarily involves text-based records and documents, image capabilities would not have a significant impact on improving the efficiency of this task. Therefore, this task is not likely to fall under E3.
