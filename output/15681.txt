1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of serving on academic or administrative committees, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it. 

- E1: If the task involves writing reports, drafting policies, or providing recommendations based on complex institutional data, the LLM could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete these tasks with equivalent quality. The LLM could help in generating detailed reports, analyzing data, and drafting documents related to institutional policies and academic issues.
- E2: If the task requires accessing and summarizing large volumes of academic literature, historical data, or legal documents to inform committee decisions, the LLM alone may not reduce the time by half, but additional software could be developed to assist in summarizing and analyzing these documents efficiently.
- E3: If the task involves reviewing visual data, such as charts, graphs, or images related to academic or administrative matters, the LLM's image capabilities could be useful in processing and interpreting this information.
