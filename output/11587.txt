1: In this task, a First-Line Supervisor of Material-Moving Machine and Vehicle Operators is responsible for performing or scheduling repairs or preventive maintenance of vehicles or other equipment. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it.

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM could assist in writing repair instructions, maintenance schedules, or communicating with technicians regarding repairs. It could also help in documenting maintenance procedures or generating reports related to the maintenance activities. The LLM could provide text-based guidance and information related to vehicle maintenance.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time it takes to perform or schedule repairs or maintenance, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to streamline the process. This software could potentially analyze maintenance data, provide recommendations for preventive maintenance based on historical data, or even assist in diagnosing vehicle issues based on input data.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Since this task primarily involves text-based instructions and communication related to vehicle maintenance, image capabilities may not significantly impact the completion of the task. The task does not involve detailed image analysis or editing, making image capabilities less relevant in this context.
