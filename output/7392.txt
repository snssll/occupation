1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of identifying and resolving deficiencies in photovoltaic system installation or materials for Solar Photovoltaic Installers, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. In this task, the LLM could potentially assist by providing information on common deficiencies in PV system installations, suggesting troubleshooting steps, offering best practices for installation, and recommending materials to address specific issues. The LLM could also help in generating reports or documentation related to the identified deficiencies and solutions. However, since this task involves hands-on work and practical knowledge of PV systems, the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete the task with high quality. While the LLM can provide information and guidance, the actual resolution of deficiencies would require physical intervention and expertise beyond what the LLM can offer.
