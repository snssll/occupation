1: In this task, the Nursing Instructor or Teacher is required to prepare and deliver lectures to students on various topics related to nursing. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be significantly aided by the use of the language model. The LLM can assist in generating lecture notes, providing additional resources, suggesting interactive teaching methods, creating quizzes or assessments, and even helping in structuring the lecture content. Since the task involves a significant amount of text-based work, including research, content creation, and communication, the LLM can be highly beneficial in enhancing the efficiency and quality of the lecture preparation process.

Considering the nature of the task and the potential for the LLM to streamline various aspects of lecture preparation, it aligns more closely with E1 exposure. The LLM can assist in writing and transforming text, providing edits, generating questions, and preparing training materials, all of which are relevant to the task of preparing and delivering lectures as a Nursing Instructor or Teacher.
