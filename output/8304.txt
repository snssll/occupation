1: In this task, the First-Line Supervisors of Retail Sales Workers are required to instruct staff on how to handle difficult and complicated sales situations. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves providing guidance and instructions on a specific topic related to retail sales, which can be effectively communicated through text. The task does not require specialized domain knowledge beyond retail sales, and the information needed to provide instructions is likely within the scope of general knowledge or can be provided in the input text. The task does not involve visual elements or complex data analysis. Therefore, the task can be completed efficiently using the LLM to generate written instructions or guidance for handling difficult sales situations.
