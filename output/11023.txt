- E0: This task involves a high degree of human interaction and decision-making that may require nuanced understanding of cultural and educational contexts.

- E1: While the LLM could potentially assist in generating written materials, such as program descriptions or communication with participants, the core aspects of organizing and directing study abroad programs involve complex decision-making, interpersonal skills, and practical logistics that go beyond text generation. The LLM may not significantly reduce the time or improve the quality of completing this task.

- E2: It is conceivable that additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to assist with certain aspects of organizing study abroad programs, such as summarizing relevant documents, providing recommendations based on data analysis, or retrieving specialized domain knowledge related to specific destinations. However, the core responsibilities of organizing and directing study abroad programs still heavily rely on human judgment and expertise that may not be easily automated.
