1: In this task, a Multiple Machine Tool Setter, Operator, or Tender for Metal and Plastic needs to start machines and engage various mechanisms. This task involves physical actions such as turning handwheels or valves. Since the task is hands-on and requires physical manipulation of machinery, it does not involve text input or output that can be processed by an LLM. Therefore, the task does not fall under any of the exposure categories (E0, E1, E2, E3) as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM.
