1: In this task, a Brickmason or Blockmason is required to measure distances from reference points and mark guidelines using tools like plumb bobs and levels. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone or with additional software could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task. 

- E0: This task involves physical measurements and the use of tools that require manual work. The LLM does not have the capability to physically measure distances or use tools like plumb bobs and levels. Therefore, the task cannot be completed using the LLM or LLM-powered tools.
