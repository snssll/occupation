1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of controlling traffic passing near, in, or around work zones as a Construction Laborer, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves ensuring the safety of workers and the public by managing traffic flow in construction areas. This task requires physical presence and interaction with moving vehicles, making it unsuitable for automation using the LLM or any LLM-powered tools. The task also involves real-time decision-making based on visual cues and situational awareness, which are not within the current capabilities of the LLM. Therefore, this task falls under the E0 category as it cannot be significantly aided by the LLM.

2: E0
