1: In this task, a Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Physician is required to examine patients to assess various aspects such as mobility, strength, communication, or cognition. This task involves physical interaction with patients, observation of their movements, and direct assessment of their abilities. The task does not involve text-based inputs or outputs that can be easily processed by an LLM. Since the task requires hands-on examination and assessment of patients, it falls under the category of tasks that cannot be effectively completed by an LLM or any software tool built on top of it. Therefore, this task would be classified as E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM.
