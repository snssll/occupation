1: In this task, an Elevator and Escalator Installer and Repairer is required to locate malfunctions in various components of elevators and escalators using test equipment. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be significantly aided by the use of the language model. The task involves hands-on work with physical equipment and requires technical knowledge and skills related to elevator and escalator systems. While the LLM could potentially provide information on troubleshooting techniques or general information about elevator components, it cannot physically interact with the equipment or perform the testing itself. Therefore, the task does not align with the capabilities of the LLM, and it falls under E0 as it does not significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete the task.
