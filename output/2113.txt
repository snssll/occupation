1: In this task, a Diagnostic Medical Sonographer is responsible for cleaning, checking, and maintaining sonographic equipment. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone or with additional software could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality.

- E1: Direct exposure - The task involves straightforward instructions related to equipment maintenance, which could be easily guided by the LLM through text-based instructions or checklists. The LLM could provide detailed steps on how to clean, check, and maintain the equipment, as well as troubleshoot common issues. This direct guidance could reduce the time needed to complete the task.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not reduce the time significantly for this task, additional software could be developed to provide interactive maintenance guides, troubleshooting tips, and real-time assistance for repairs. Such software could integrate with the LLM's capabilities to offer more specialized advice based on the specific equipment being used.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Since this task primarily involves equipment maintenance rather than image-related activities, the image capabilities of the LLM would not have a significant impact on completing this task.
