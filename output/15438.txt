1: In this task, a firefighter is required to select and attach hose nozzles based on the type of fire and then direct streams of water or chemicals onto fires. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves physical actions such as selecting and attaching hose nozzles and directing streams of water or chemicals onto fires. These actions cannot be performed by an LLM or any software tool alone. Additionally, the task requires real-time decision-making based on the type of fire, which involves assessing the situation, understanding the fire dynamics, and making quick judgments. Since the task involves physical actions and real-time decision-making that cannot be automated by an LLM, it falls under E0.
