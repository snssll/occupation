1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of monitoring traffic flow to locate safe gaps for pedestrians to cross streets as a Crossing Guard or Flagger, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be aided by the use of a large language model (LLM).

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** The task involves real-time decision-making based on observing traffic flow and ensuring pedestrian safety. While an LLM could potentially provide information on traffic regulations or safety guidelines, the real-time nature of the task and the need for physical presence to direct pedestrians across the street make it unlikely that the LLM alone could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** It is conceivable that an application could be developed on top of the LLM that provides real-time traffic updates, safety alerts, or even suggestions for optimal crossing times based on traffic patterns. However, the physical aspect of the task, such as physically stopping traffic when needed, would still require human intervention. Therefore, while an application could enhance the task, it may not reduce the time it takes to complete the task by half.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Image capabilities would not significantly impact the task of monitoring traffic flow and ensuring pedestrian safety as it primarily involves real-time observation and decision-making rather than image processing.
