1: In this task, the main activity is sweeping or scrubbing floors, which is a physical task that cannot be directly performed by an LLM. The task does not involve any complex decision-making, analysis, or writing that would benefit significantly from LLM capabilities. Therefore, there is no clear way for the LLM to reduce the time it takes to complete this task with high quality by at least half. As such, this task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM.
