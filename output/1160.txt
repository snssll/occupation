1: In this task, a Lighting Technician is required to assess the safety of wiring or equipment set-up to determine the risk of fire or electrical shock. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be aided by the LLM. 

- **E0**: This task involves physical inspection and assessment of wiring and equipment set-up, which requires hands-on work and expertise in electrical systems. The task also involves ensuring compliance with safety regulations and standards, which may involve specific knowledge and experience in the field. The LLM, even with its text-based capabilities, cannot replace the need for physical inspection and practical knowledge required for this task.

- **E1**: The LLM could potentially assist in providing general information on safety standards, regulations, and best practices related to electrical systems. It could also help in generating reports or documentation based on the findings of the assessment. However, the core aspect of physically assessing the safety of wiring and equipment set-up, which involves hands-on work and practical knowledge, cannot be effectively replaced by the LLM alone.

- **E2**: While the LLM could potentially be used to access and summarize information on safety standards and regulations, it would not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task by half. Developing software on top of the LLM that could assist in generating safety assessment reports or providing recommendations based on the assessment findings might be possible, but it would require additional capabilities beyond what the LLM currently offers.

- **E3**: The task does not involve image processing or detailed visual analysis that would require additional image capabilities beyond what the LLM offers. Therefore, this task does not fall under E3.
