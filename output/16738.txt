1: In this task, a News Analyst, Reporter, or Journalist is required to take pictures or video and process them for inclusion in a story. This task involves both visual and written components. While the LLM can assist with writing and editing text for the story, it does not have the capability to take pictures or videos. Additionally, the LLM does not have the ability to process visual content or make decisions based on visual input. As a result, this task falls under E0 as the LLM alone cannot significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task.
