1: In this task, the occupation involves providing information to customers on the care of trees, shrubs, flowers, plants, and lawns. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if the task can be significantly expedited or improved by using the LLM. 

- The task involves providing information, which the LLM can assist with by generating detailed care instructions, tips, and advice for various plants and trees.
- The LLM can also help in creating educational materials or guides for customers on plant care.
- Additionally, the LLM can aid in responding to specific customer queries related to plant care, thereby enhancing customer service.

Considering these points, the task can benefit from the LLM's capabilities in generating text, providing information, and assisting in customer interactions related to plant care. Therefore, the task falls under label E1 as direct access to the LLM can reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality by at least half.
