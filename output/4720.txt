1: In this task, a Web Administrator is responsible for developing website performance metrics. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM can assist in completing it. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM can help in writing and transforming text related to website performance metrics, providing edits to existing metrics, and generating ideas for different metrics to track. The LLM can also assist in summarizing information related to website performance, which can be useful in developing metrics. Therefore, the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality by at least half.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone can assist in various aspects of developing website performance metrics, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to automate the process further. This software could potentially retrieve up-to-date performance data from the internet, analyze trends, and make recommendations based on the data. This additional software could further enhance the efficiency of developing website performance metrics.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not directly relevant to developing website performance metrics. This task primarily involves working with text and data related to website performance, which can be effectively handled by the LLM without the need for image capabilities.

Based on the above analysis, the task of developing website performance metrics for Web Administrators falls under E1: Direct exposure.
