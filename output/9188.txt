1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of maintaining knowledge of relevant national and international current events as a legislator, we need to consider how the LLM can assist in this task. The LLM can provide information on past events and general knowledge, but it cannot access up-to-date facts unless they are explicitly provided in the input. In this case, the task requires staying updated on current events, which may involve recent news and developments. While the LLM can help summarize past events or provide background information, it cannot independently retrieve the most recent news without it being explicitly stated in the input. Therefore, the LLM alone would not significantly reduce the time it takes for a legislator to stay informed about current events.
