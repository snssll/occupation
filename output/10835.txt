1: In this task, the Continuous Mining Machine Operators operate mining machines to gather coal and convey it to floors or shuttle cars. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves operating mining machines, which is a hands-on, physical activity that requires being present at the mining site. This task does not involve text input or output, and the context is primarily related to physical actions rather than written information. As such, the task does not align with the capabilities of the LLM, which is focused on text-based tasks and does not have the ability to perform physical actions or operate machinery. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not benefit from the use of the LLM or any tools built on top of it.
