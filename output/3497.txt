1: In this task, a Funeral Home Manager consults with families or friends of the deceased to arrange funeral details. This task involves a significant amount of communication, empathy, and attention to detail. While the LLM could potentially assist in generating sample obituary notice wordings or providing information on casket selection, the core of the task involves personal interactions and emotional support, which cannot be effectively replaced by the LLM. The nuances of dealing with grieving families, understanding their specific needs, and providing personalized support require human touch and empathy, which the LLM lacks. Therefore, the task falls under E0 as it does not significantly benefit from LLM capabilities.

2: E0
