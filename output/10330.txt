1: In this task, a curator is responsible for negotiating and authorizing the purchase, sale, exchange, or loan of collections. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes for a curator to complete this task with high quality. 

- E0: This task involves negotiation, decision-making, and potentially legal considerations that require human judgment and interaction. The LLM cannot make decisions that might impact human livelihood, and negotiating transactions like purchases, sales, exchanges, or loans involve complex factors beyond text-based information processing.
- E1: While the LLM could potentially assist in drafting written correspondence related to negotiations or providing background information on items in collections, the core aspects of negotiation and authorization require human expertise, judgment, and interaction. The LLM alone cannot significantly reduce the time it takes for a curator to complete these tasks.
- E2: It is conceivable that additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to assist curators in tasks such as summarizing information about collections, retrieving relevant market data, or providing legal insights. However, the core task of negotiating and authorizing transactions still heavily relies on human decision-making and expertise.
- E3: The task does not involve image processing or analysis, so the image capabilities of the LLM are not relevant in this context.
