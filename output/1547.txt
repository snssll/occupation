1: In this task, a Mechanical Door Repairer is required to bore or cut holes in flooring for installation using hand or power tools. This task involves physical labor and precise measurements, which cannot be directly assisted by an LLM. The LLM cannot perform tasks that require physical actions or measurements, so it cannot directly reduce the time it takes to complete this task. Additionally, this task does not involve complex written instructions, data analysis, or specialized knowledge that the LLM could assist with. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not meet the criteria for exposure to LLM capabilities.
