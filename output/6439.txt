1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of evaluating mechanical designs or prototypes for energy performance or environmental impact as a Mechanical Engineer, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be aided by the use of a large language model (LLM).

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** If the task involves analyzing and evaluating text-based information related to mechanical designs or prototypes, an LLM could significantly reduce the time it takes to gather relevant data, provide insights, and generate reports based on the input. The LLM could assist in summarizing technical documents, providing feedback on energy performance or environmental impact, and even generating recommendations based on the analysis.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While an LLM alone may not reduce the time it takes to complete the task by half, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to enhance the analysis process. This software could include capabilities such as retrieving up-to-date information on energy efficiency technologies, environmental regulations, or industry best practices to complement the evaluation process.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Since the task specifically mentions evaluating designs or prototypes, which may involve visual elements, having access to image capabilities in addition to the LLM could aid in analyzing and interpreting visual data related to energy performance or environmental impact. This could involve scanning images of designs, diagrams, or prototypes to provide a more comprehensive evaluation.
