1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of assigning and grading class work and homework for teachers in various educational settings, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be supported by the capabilities of the LLM. 

- Assigning class work and homework involves creating tasks, instructions, and materials for students. This task can be supported by the LLM through generating various types of assignments based on specific criteria provided by the teacher.
- Grading class work and homework involves evaluating student submissions, providing feedback, and assigning grades. The LLM can assist in grading by providing automated feedback based on predefined criteria or by generating model answers for certain types of assignments.

Given that the task involves a significant amount of text-based input and output, the LLM can be used to streamline the process of creating assignments, grading student work, and providing feedback. The LLM can generate a variety of assignment types and help automate parts of the grading process, saving time for teachers.
