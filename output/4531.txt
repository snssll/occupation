1: In this task, a Helper-Installation, Maintenance, and Repair Worker is required to design, weld, and fabricate parts based on blueprints or mechanical plans. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves technical skills such as welding and fabrication, which require hands-on work and precise measurements. While an LLM could potentially assist in generating text-based instructions or providing theoretical knowledge about welding and fabrication techniques, it cannot physically perform the welding or fabrication tasks. Additionally, the task involves interpreting blueprints and mechanical plans, which may require visual understanding and spatial reasoning, areas where LLMs are not specialized. Therefore, the task does not seem to benefit significantly from LLM capabilities, as it primarily involves manual work and technical skills that cannot be directly replaced by text-based assistance.
