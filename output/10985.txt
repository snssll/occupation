1: In this task, a bartender is required to order or requisition liquors and supplies. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be completed with the help of an LLM. 

- E0: This task involves physical actions such as ordering and requisitioning, which cannot be directly performed by an LLM. Additionally, it may involve specific knowledge of inventory, pricing, and supplier relationships that are not typically within the scope of an LLM's capabilities. Therefore, this task is unlikely to benefit significantly from LLM assistance.

- E1: While an LLM could potentially assist in drafting emails or written communications related to ordering supplies, the core task of actually placing orders and managing inventory is not something that can be directly automated by an LLM. The complexity of supplier relationships, pricing negotiations, and inventory management requires human judgment and interaction.

- E2: It is conceivable that specialized software could be developed on top of an LLM to help with inventory management, supplier recommendations, or pricing analysis. Such software could potentially streamline the process of ordering supplies for bartenders. However, this would require a more sophisticated system beyond the capabilities of the LLM alone.

- E3: Image capabilities are not relevant to this task, as it does not involve image processing or analysis.
