1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of recording license numbers of vehicles disregarding traffic signals and reporting infractions to appropriate authorities as a Crossing Guard or Flagger, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be aided by the use of an LLM.

- The task involves recording license numbers, which is a straightforward data collection process that can be easily done by a human.
- Reporting infractions to appropriate authorities may involve some level of documentation and communication, which could benefit from the LLM's ability to assist in writing and transforming text according to complex instructions.
- While the LLM could potentially help in drafting reports or documenting incidents, the task does not involve complex decision-making or specialized domain knowledge that would significantly benefit from the LLM's capabilities beyond basic text generation.

Considering these points, the task of recording license numbers of vehicles disregarding traffic signals and reporting infractions to appropriate authorities falls under E1 exposure, as the LLM can assist in writing reports or documenting incidents, but the task itself is not highly complex or specialized.
