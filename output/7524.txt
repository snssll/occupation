1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of identifying stations, introducing or closing shows, ad-libbing, or using scripts as a Broadcast Announcer or Radio Disc Jockey, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves a significant amount of text-based work, such as reading scripts, ad-libbing, and potentially researching stations. The LLM can assist in generating scripts, providing ad-lib suggestions, and potentially even helping with station research.
