1: In this task, a Set and Exhibit Designer is responsible for assigning staff to complete design ideas and prepare sketches, illustrations, and detailed drawings of sets, graphics, and animations. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves coordinating and overseeing the creation of visual designs, which can benefit from the LLM's capabilities in generating text and providing guidance on design concepts.
