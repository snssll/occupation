1: In this task, a Floor Layer is required to heat and soften floor covering materials to patch cracks or fit floor coverings around irregular surfaces using a blowtorch. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. This task involves physical work that cannot be directly performed by an LLM. The use of a blowtorch and the physical manipulation of floor covering materials are actions that require human intervention and cannot be replicated by text-based AI models. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not involve activities that can be significantly aided by an LLM.

2: E0
