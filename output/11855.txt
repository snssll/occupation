1: In this task of placing wheels on balancing machines to determine counterweights required to balance wheels, the primary actions involve physical manipulation of the wheels and machines. This task does not involve text input or output, and the context is based on physical objects and measurements. The task also requires precise measurements and direct interaction with the equipment, which cannot be replaced by text-based instructions or responses from an LLM. Therefore, the task does not align with any of the exposure levels in the rubric.
