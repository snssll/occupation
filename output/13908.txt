1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of recommending data-driven solutions to key stakeholders as a Data Scientist, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM in assisting with this task. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM can assist in generating data-driven solutions by analyzing data, providing insights, and even drafting reports or recommendations based on the analysis. It can help in formulating the language and structure of the recommendations to key stakeholders.
- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone can provide valuable insights and recommendations, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to streamline the process further by automating data analysis, generating visualizations, and integrating real-time data for more accurate recommendations.
- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not directly relevant to the task of recommending data-driven solutions to key stakeholders, so this label does not apply.

Considering the above points, the task of recommending data-driven solutions to key stakeholders as a Data Scientist aligns more closely with E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications, as additional software could enhance the efficiency and accuracy of the data analysis and recommendation process.
