1: In this task, a janitor or cleaner is required to clean windows, glass partitions, or mirrors using soapy water or other cleaners, sponges, or squeegees. This task involves manual labor and physical interaction with the cleaning tools and surfaces. The task does not involve complex decision-making, specialized knowledge, or extensive text-based interactions that would benefit significantly from the capabilities of a large language model (LLM). Therefore, there is no clear way for the LLM to reduce the time it takes to complete this task with high quality by at least half. As such, this task falls under the E0 category as it does not benefit from exposure to an LLM.

2: E0

3: High
