1: In this task, the occupation involves preparing and delivering lectures to students on various topics related to atmospheric, earth, marine, and space sciences. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves creating lecture content, which may require researching, organizing information, and presenting it in a coherent manner. The LLM can assist in generating content, providing explanations, and even suggesting examples or visuals to enhance the lecture material. Additionally, the LLM can help in summarizing complex scientific concepts, answering questions, and providing additional resources for students. Overall, the LLM can significantly reduce the time required to prepare lectures and enhance the quality of the content.

Considering these factors, the task aligns with E1 exposure as the LLM can directly assist in writing and transforming text, providing edits, summarizing documents, and generating questions related to the lecture topics. The LLM can streamline the process of creating lecture materials and improve the overall effectiveness of the teaching content.
