1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of assisting other restaurant workers by serving food and beverages or bussing tables as a Host or Hostess, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves basic restaurant service duties that do not require complex decision-making or specialized knowledge beyond standard restaurant operations. The LLM can provide guidance on general restaurant service procedures, etiquette, and best practices. It can also generate sample scripts for interactions with customers and offer suggestions on efficient table bussing techniques. However, the LLM does not have the physical ability to actually serve food and beverages or bus tables in a real-world setting. Therefore, while the LLM can offer theoretical knowledge and advice related to the task, it cannot directly perform the physical actions required.
