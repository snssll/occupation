1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of designing learning products, including Web-based aids or electronic performance support systems, for Instructional Coordinators, we need to consider the level of exposure to LLM.

- Instructional Coordinators typically involve designing and implementing educational programs and materials. In this specific task, designing learning products involves creating content, structuring information, and ensuring educational effectiveness.
- The task of designing learning products can benefit from the use of an LLM to generate text, provide feedback on content, and assist in structuring information effectively.
- The LLM can help in generating written content, suggesting improvements, and even providing insights based on educational best practices.
- While the task may not directly involve complex language generation or analysis that requires the LLM's full capabilities, having access to the LLM can still significantly enhance the efficiency and quality of the design process.

Based on these considerations, the task of designing learning products for Instructional Coordinators would likely fall under the label E1 - Direct exposure.

2: E1

3: Moderate
