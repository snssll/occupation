1: In this task, the Clinical and Counseling Psychologists are required to advise clients on how they could be helped by counseling. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves providing personalized advice based on individual client needs, which requires a deep understanding of psychology, human behavior, and counseling techniques. The task also involves empathy, active listening, and the ability to tailor advice to each client's unique situation. While an LLM could potentially provide general information on counseling techniques and strategies, it lacks the ability to empathize, actively listen, and tailor advice to individual clients' needs. Therefore, the task of advising clients on how they could be helped by counseling is highly specialized and requires human expertise that goes beyond the capabilities of an LLM.
