1: In this task, the Fabric and Apparel Patternmakers are required to trace outlines of specified patterns onto material and cut fabric using scissors. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone or with additional software could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality.

- E1: Direct exposure - The task involves physical actions such as tracing patterns and cutting fabric, which cannot be directly performed by the LLM. While the LLM could potentially provide instructions or guidance on pattern-making techniques, it cannot physically trace or cut fabric.
- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - It is challenging to imagine additional software built on top of the LLM that could automate the physical actions of tracing patterns onto material and cutting fabric using scissors. This task is highly manual and requires hands-on skills that cannot be easily replicated by software.
- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - The task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images. It is primarily a manual task that does not rely on image processing capabilities.

Based on the above analysis, the task of tracing outlines of specified patterns onto material and cutting fabric using scissors is best classified as E0 - No exposure.

2: E0

3: High
