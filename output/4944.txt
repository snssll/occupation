1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of developing mathematical or statistical models as a Mathematician, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can benefit from the use of a large language model (LLM).

- Developing mathematical or statistical models involves a high level of expertise and domain knowledge in mathematics and statistics. While an LLM can assist in generating text or providing information, it may not have the specialized mathematical knowledge required to create complex models.
- The task involves analyzing phenomena and creating models for computational simulation, which may require understanding complex relationships and equations that go beyond the capabilities of a general LLM.
- Mathematicians often use specialized software and tools designed for mathematical modeling, which may not be easily replaced by an LLM alone.
- While an LLM could potentially assist in generating text explanations or providing background information related to the models, the core task of developing the models itself may not be significantly expedited by the use of an LLM.

Based on these considerations, the task of developing mathematical or statistical models as a Mathematician is best classified as E0 - No exposure.
