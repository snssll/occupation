1: In this task, an Automotive Body and Related Repairer is required to chain or clamp frames and sections to alignment machines to align damaged components. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone or with additional software could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality.

- E0: This task involves physical work that cannot be replaced by text-based interactions with the LLM. The task requires hands-on skills and precise measurements, which the LLM cannot perform.

- E1: The task does not involve writing, transforming text, or providing feedback on documents. It is a practical task that requires physical interaction with machinery, making it unsuitable for direct exposure to the LLM.

- E2: While it is conceivable that software could be developed to assist in diagnosing and suggesting repair methods for automotive body repair, the actual physical work of chaining or clamping frames to alignment machines cannot be directly performed by the LLM or software built on top of it.

- E3: The task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images. The physical nature of the task does not align with the capabilities provided by image processing systems in conjunction with the LLM.
