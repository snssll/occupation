1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of planning data collection methods for specific projects and determining sample group sizes as a Statistician, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves analyzing data requirements, understanding project objectives, and making informed decisions about sample sizes. 

- E0: This task does not involve any direct text-based input or output that the LLM can significantly assist with. It requires domain expertise in statistics and research methodology, which the LLM may not have the specialized knowledge to provide.

- E1: While the LLM can assist in generating text-based information and providing general guidance on data collection methods, it may not have the specific domain knowledge required to accurately plan data collection methods and determine sample sizes for statistical projects. The task involves a high level of expertise and decision-making that may not be easily automated by the LLM.

- E2: It is conceivable that additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to assist Statisticians in planning data collection methods and determining sample sizes more efficiently. This software could potentially integrate with existing statistical tools and databases to provide recommendations based on the project requirements and objectives.

- E3: The task does not involve image processing capabilities, so exposure to image capabilities would not significantly impact the completion of this task.
