1: In this task, a Lighting Technician is required to consult with the lighting director or production staff to determine lighting requirements. This task involves communication, collaboration, and decision-making based on the specific needs of a production. While an LLM could potentially assist in providing general information about lighting requirements or best practices, the task itself heavily relies on human interaction, understanding the context of the production, and making decisions based on real-time information and feedback. The LLM may not have the ability to fully understand the nuances of the production environment, the artistic vision, or the practical constraints that need to be considered when determining lighting requirements. Therefore, the task is not easily reducible to text-based instructions or data processing that the LLM can handle effectively.
