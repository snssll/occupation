1: In this task, the occupation involves overseeing and coordinating the weighing, moving, and checking of products by instructing other workers. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if the task can be significantly expedited or improved by using the LLM. The task itself is more operational and involves physical coordination and communication with other workers, which cannot be directly assisted by the LLM.
