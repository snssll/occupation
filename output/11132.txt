1: In this task, an embalmer is required to pack body orifices with cotton saturated with embalming fluid to prevent the escape of gases or waste matter. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. This task involves a specific and technical procedure that requires knowledge of anatomy, embalming techniques, and safety protocols. The task does not involve text input or output, and the context is not something that can be easily captured within 2000 words for an LLM to provide assistance. Additionally, this task involves physical interaction with a deceased body, which cannot be performed by an LLM or any software tool. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of an LLM or any software tool based on an LLM.
