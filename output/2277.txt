1: In this task, the writer or author, specifically a poet, lyricist, or creative writer, is required to collaborate with other writers on specific projects. To complete this task, the writer needs to communicate effectively, share ideas, provide feedback, and work together towards a common creative goal. With the help of the LLM, the writer could potentially generate ideas, draft collaborative pieces, provide feedback, and even facilitate communication with other writers. The LLM could assist in brainstorming, suggesting creative directions, and refining the collaborative work. However, the LLM alone cannot fully replace the need for human interaction and the nuanced creative process involved in collaboration. While the LLM can aid in certain aspects of the task, such as generating initial ideas or providing feedback, it cannot fully replicate the collaborative dynamic between human writers. Therefore, this task falls under E2 exposure as additional software could be developed to enhance collaboration tools for writers, but the current capabilities of the LLM alone do not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task.
