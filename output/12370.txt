1: In this task, a Purchasing Manager is responsible for preparing and processing requisitions and purchase orders for supplies and equipment. To determine the appropriate exposure label for this task in relation to the LLM, we can break it down as follows:

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** The LLM can assist in writing and transforming text related to requisitions and purchase orders. It can help draft emails, provide feedback on documents, and maintain records of written data. The model can also generate questions or responses related to the task. Therefore, if the task involves a significant amount of text-based work, the LLM could reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality by at least half.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the LLM alone may not reduce the time to complete the task by half, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to summarize longer documents, retrieve up-to-date information on supplies and equipment, or provide recommendations based on data. Such software could enhance the efficiency of the Purchasing Manager's role.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Image capabilities are not relevant to this task as it primarily involves text-based activities like preparing requisitions and purchase orders. Therefore, this task does not fall under E3.
