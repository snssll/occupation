1: In this task of answering students' questions as a short-term substitute teacher, the main activity involves providing responses to queries from students in a classroom setting. The task does not involve complex data analysis, specialized domain knowledge, or the need for image capabilities. The information needed to answer students' questions is typically within the context of the classroom and the curriculum being taught. The task primarily requires verbal communication and the ability to provide clear explanations to students.

Given that the task does not involve extensive research, data retrieval, or specialized knowledge beyond what a substitute teacher would typically possess, the use of an LLM may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task. While the LLM could potentially provide assistance in formulating responses or explanations, the nature of the task is more reliant on real-time interaction and communication with students.
