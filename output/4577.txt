1: In this task, an Arbitrator, Mediator, or Conciliator is required to determine the extent of liability based on evidence, laws, or precedents. This task involves analyzing legal information, understanding complex legal concepts, and applying them to make decisions. An LLM could assist by providing information on relevant laws, legal precedents, and possibly even analyzing evidence to some extent. The LLM could help in summarizing legal documents, providing insights into past cases, and potentially even suggesting arguments or considerations to take into account. However, the task also requires a deep understanding of legal nuances, case law, and the ability to interpret evidence in a legal context, which may go beyond the capabilities of the LLM.
