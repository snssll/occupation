1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of explaining testing procedures to patients as a Cardiovascular Technologist or Technician, we need to consider the nature of the task and how LLM exposure could impact it. 

- This task involves communicating with patients to explain complex medical procedures in a clear and understandable manner. The LLM could assist in generating scripts or guidelines for explaining testing procedures effectively, potentially reducing the time needed to prepare these explanations.
- The LLM could also help in providing information on different testing procedures, common patient concerns, and strategies to reduce patient anxiety, which could enhance the quality of the explanations given to patients.
- While the LLM could provide general information and guidance, the task also requires empathy, active listening, and the ability to tailor explanations to individual patients' needs, which may not be fully addressed by the LLM alone.

Considering these points, the task could benefit from the LLM's assistance in generating information and guidelines but may still require human skills for effective patient communication.
