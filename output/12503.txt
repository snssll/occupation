1: In this task, a Surgical Technologist is responsible for preparing dressings or bandages and applying them following surgery. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves practical, hands-on skills that require physical presence and interaction in a surgical setting. It involves applying dressings or bandages in a precise and sterile manner, which cannot be done solely through text-based instructions or communication. The task also requires knowledge of surgical procedures, sterile techniques, and patient care, which are not solely text-based and involve physical actions.

Given that the task involves physical actions, precise measurements, and direct interaction with patients and surgical equipment, it falls under the E0 category. The task cannot be effectively completed using an LLM or any text-based tool alone.
