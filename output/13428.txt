1: In this task, a dental assistant is required to provide postoperative instructions prescribed by a dentist to patients after dental procedures. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. Providing postoperative instructions involves conveying specific information to patients regarding care, medication, and potential complications after a dental procedure. This task primarily involves written communication and does not require specialized domain knowledge beyond what a dental assistant would typically possess. The task does not involve complex decision-making or analysis that would benefit significantly from the capabilities of a large language model. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not clearly benefit from the use of an LLM to reduce the time it takes for an experienced dental assistant to complete the task.
