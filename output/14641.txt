1: In this task, a School Bus Monitor is responsible for reporting delays, accidents, or other traffic and transportation situations to dispatchers or other bus drivers using phones or mobile two-way radios. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves communication and reporting in real-time, which requires immediate action and interaction with others. While an LLM could potentially assist in drafting the messages or reports, the core aspect of this task involves real-time communication and coordination, which may not be significantly enhanced by the LLM. Therefore, the task falls under E0 as it involves human interaction and real-time communication that cannot be fully automated by the LLM.
