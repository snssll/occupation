1: In this task, the occupation involves pouring and casting metal, specifically removing metal ingots or cores from molds. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality. Since this task involves physical actions like using hand tools, cranes, and chain hoists, it cannot be directly completed using the LLM. The LLM cannot perform physical tasks or interact with physical objects. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not meet the criteria for exposure to LLM capabilities.

2: E0

3: High
