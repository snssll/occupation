1: In this task, the occupation involves setting up, operating, or tending machines to crush, grind, or polish materials such as coal, glass, grain, stone, food, or rubber. The specific task mentioned is cleaning, adjusting, and maintaining equipment using hand tools. To determine the exposure level, we need to consider if the task can be significantly expedited or improved by using the LLM. Since this task involves physical interaction with machinery and tools, it does not directly involve text input or output that the LLM can assist with. The task does not require complex instructions, writing, summarizing, or any form of data analysis that the LLM could enhance. Therefore, the task does not fall under E1, E2, or E3 exposure levels.
