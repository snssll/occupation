1: In this task, a Veterinary Assistant is required to monitor animals recovering from surgery and notify veterinarians of any unusual changes or symptoms. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves observing and reporting on the condition of animals, which primarily requires human observation skills and knowledge of animal behavior and health. While an LLM could potentially assist in providing general information on animal care and common post-surgery symptoms, the critical aspect of this task involves hands-on observation and interaction with the animals, which cannot be effectively replaced by an LLM. Therefore, the task does not significantly benefit from direct access to an LLM, as the core components of the task rely on physical observation and interaction.
