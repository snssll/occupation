1: In this task of assembling parts or units using hand tools and power tools, the exposure to LLM can be evaluated as follows:

- The task involves physical manipulation of parts and tools, which cannot be directly assisted by the LLM.
- While the LLM could potentially provide guidance or instructions on how to assemble specific parts, the actual physical assembly work cannot be done by the LLM.
- The task does not involve complex decision-making or specialized knowledge that would significantly benefit from LLM capabilities.
- Overall, the task does not align with the capabilities of the LLM in a way that would reduce the time it takes to complete the task significantly.

Based on these considerations, the task falls under E0 as it does not benefit from the exposure to the LLM in completing the task.

2: E0
