1: For the task of preparing specialty foods as a fast-food cook, the exposure to LLM can be evaluated as follows:

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** The task involves following specific methods for preparing fast-food items, which can be guided by text instructions. The LLM can provide detailed step-by-step instructions, recipes, and tips on how to prepare these specialty foods efficiently. It can also assist in troubleshooting common issues that may arise during food preparation. Therefore, direct access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality by providing real-time guidance and support.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the LLM alone can provide valuable guidance for preparing specialty foods, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to enhance the task further. For example, an application could be created that generates customized recipes based on available ingredients or customer preferences, optimizes cooking times, or suggests innovative variations of traditional fast-food items. Such software could streamline the cooking process even more, although the base LLM itself is already quite helpful.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Image capabilities are not essential for the task of preparing specialty foods as a fast-food cook. The task primarily involves following text-based instructions for cooking, and image capabilities would not significantly impact the completion time or quality of the task.

Based on the above analysis, the most fitting label for the task of preparing specialty foods as a fast-food cook is **E1 (Direct exposure)**.
