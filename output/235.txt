1: In this task, a Speech-Language Pathologist administers evaluations and tests to patients to collect information on impairments related to hearing, speech, and language. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves conducting assessments, which may involve interacting with patients, analyzing test results, and making diagnostic decisions based on the collected information. While an LLM could potentially assist in generating written reports or providing background information on specific impairments, it cannot directly administer tests or interact with patients. Therefore, the task does not fall under E1, as the LLM alone cannot significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task. Additionally, developing software on top of the LLM to assist in conducting assessments would be complex and may not lead to a clear reduction in time. The task also does not involve detailed visuals or measurements that would require image capabilities, ruling out E3. Given these considerations, the task aligns more closely with E0, as the core aspects of the task cannot be directly facilitated by the LLM or its applications.
