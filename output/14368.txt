1: In this task, a general dentist is required to remove diseased tissue using surgical instruments. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves a hands-on, physical procedure that requires precision and expertise in dentistry. The task does not involve text input or output, and the context cannot be captured within 2000 words. The task also does not involve any written or spoken communication that could be facilitated by an LLM. Therefore, the task of removing diseased tissue using surgical instruments does not align with the capabilities of an LLM, and there are no tools built on top of the LLM that could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task. As a result, this task falls under E0 as it does not benefit from exposure to an LLM.
