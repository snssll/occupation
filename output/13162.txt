1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of providing application or analytical support to researchers or traders as a Financial Quantitative Analyst, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be impacted by the use of the LLM.

- Financial Quantitative Analysts typically deal with complex financial data, valuations, and analysis, which may require a deep understanding of financial markets and quantitative methods.
- The task involves providing application or analytical support to researchers or traders, which may include tasks like data analysis, modeling, and generating insights based on financial data.
- The task does not involve visual or image processing, and the primary requirement is to analyze and interpret textual data related to financial issues.

Given these considerations, the task of providing application or analytical support to researchers or traders as a Financial Quantitative Analyst would likely fall under E2 - Exposure by LLM-powered applications. While direct access to the LLM alone may not reduce the time significantly for completing the task, additional software developed on top of the LLM could enhance the analytical capabilities, data processing, and decision-making support for financial analysis tasks.
