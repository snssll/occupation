1: In this task, an ophthalmologist is required to prescribe corrective lenses such as glasses or contact lenses to patients. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves assessing a patient's vision needs, analyzing eye health, and determining the correct prescription for corrective lenses. This task heavily relies on the ophthalmologist's expertise, patient interaction, and physical examination of the eyes. While the LLM could potentially provide general information on corrective lenses, it cannot replace the hands-on examination and personalized care required in this task. Therefore, the task does not align with any of the exposure labels that involve text-based or image-based capabilities of the LLM.
