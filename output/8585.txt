1: In this task, the Laundry and Dry-Cleaning Worker is required to iron or press articles, fabrics, and furs using hand irons or pressing machines. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. Ironing or pressing clothes involves manual labor and physical interaction with the items being pressed. This task does not involve complex text input or output that can be easily handled by an LLM. Additionally, the task requires physical dexterity and the ability to handle the items being pressed, which cannot be replicated by an LLM. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM or any tools built on top of it.

2: E0
