1: In this task, a stonemason is responsible for removing sections of a monument from a truck bed and guiding the stone onto a foundation using skids, hoists, or a truck crane. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be significantly aided by the language model. Since this task involves physical labor, such as handling heavy stones and operating machinery like cranes, it falls under the category of tasks that require physical interaction and precise movements. The LLM cannot assist in physical tasks or operate machinery, so it would not reduce the time it takes to complete this task significantly.
