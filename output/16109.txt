1: In this task, the occupation involves organizing and overseeing extracurricular activities for students. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be significantly aided by the use of the language model. The task involves planning, coordinating, and managing various activities, which may require human interaction, decision-making based on nuanced understanding of student needs and interests, and logistical considerations. While the LLM could potentially assist in generating ideas for activities, drafting communication materials, or providing information on best practices, the core aspects of organizing and sponsoring extracurricular activities involve human judgment, empathy, and real-time decision-making that may not be effectively replaced by the model. Therefore, the task is likely to fall under E0 as it does not clearly benefit from LLM assistance in reducing the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete the task.
