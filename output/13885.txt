1: In this task, a web developer is required to recommend and implement performance improvements for a website. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we can break down the task:
- The task involves analyzing the current performance of a website, identifying areas for improvement, and recommending specific changes to enhance performance.
- The web developer needs to have a good understanding of web development best practices, optimization techniques, and tools to improve website performance.
- The task may involve optimizing code, images, databases, server configurations, and other elements that impact website speed and efficiency.
- The recommendations should be based on the specific requirements of the website and may require testing and monitoring to ensure the improvements are effective.

Given the complexity and domain-specific knowledge required for this task, it falls under E2 exposure. While the LLM can provide general information on web development concepts, it may not have the specialized knowledge and tools necessary to directly recommend and implement performance improvements for a website.
