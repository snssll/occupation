1: In this task, the Loading and Moving Machine Operators, Underground Mining, are required to drive machines into piles of material blasted from working faces. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves operating heavy machinery underground to move materials, which requires physical presence and hands-on operation. This task does not involve text input or output, and the context cannot be fully captured within 2000 words. Additionally, the task involves precise movements and potentially hazardous conditions, which cannot be effectively simulated or replaced by an LLM. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM or any tools built on top of it.

2: E0
