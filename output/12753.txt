1: In this task, an Agricultural Engineer is required to prepare various documents such as reports, sketches, drawings, specifications, proposals, and budgets for proposed agricultural sites or systems. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM can assist in completing it. 

- E1: Direct access to the LLM could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task by assisting in writing and transforming text according to complex instructions. The LLM can help generate text for reports, proposals, and specifications based on the input provided by the engineer. It can also assist in drafting budgets and summarizing information.
  
- E2: While the LLM alone may not reduce the time by half, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to summarize longer documents, retrieve up-to-date information for proposals, and provide recommendations based on data input. This additional software could enhance the efficiency of preparing reports and budgets.

- E3: Image capabilities are not relevant for this task as it primarily involves text-based documents and drawings. 

Based on the above analysis, the task of preparing reports, sketches, working drawings, specifications, proposals, and budgets for proposed sites or systems aligns best with the E2 exposure label. While direct access to the LLM can be helpful, the development of additional software leveraging the LLM's capabilities could further enhance the efficiency of completing this task.
