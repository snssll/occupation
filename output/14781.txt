1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of researching new software or design concepts as a Graphic Designer, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM can assist in completing it. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The task involves researching new software or design concepts, which can be done by gathering information, reading articles, and analyzing trends. The LLM can assist in this process by providing up-to-date information, summarizing articles, and generating insights based on the data available. The LLM can help in writing reports or summaries based on the research conducted.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM can provide information and insights, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to streamline the research process further. This software could automate the gathering of information, analyze trends more efficiently, and provide recommendations based on the data collected.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Since the task does not involve working with images or visual content, the image capabilities of the LLM are not directly relevant to this task.

Based on the above analysis, the task of researching new software or design concepts as a Graphic Designer aligns best with E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications.
