1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of adapting text to accommodate musical requirements of composers and singers for the occupation of Poets, Lyricists, and Creative Writers, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves transforming text to fit specific musical needs, which can be achieved through writing and transforming text according to complex instructions. The LLM can assist in this process by generating alternative lyrics, suggesting rhymes, or adjusting the text to match the desired rhythm or tone. This task does not require up-to-date facts or specialized domain knowledge beyond language and music understanding, which the LLM can handle. Therefore, the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality, making it fall under label E1.
