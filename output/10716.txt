1: In this task, a Pharmacy Technician is required to operate cash registers to accept payment from customers. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. Operating a cash register involves basic transactional activities such as processing payments, handling cash, and providing receipts. These are manual, hands-on tasks that do not involve complex text input or output. The task does not require the use of a language model for completion, as it is primarily focused on physical interactions with customers and handling financial transactions. Therefore, the task does not fall under E1, E2, or E3 categories as it does not involve text-based operations or image capabilities.

2: E0
