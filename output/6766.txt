1: In this task, the nursing assistant is required to exercise patients who are comatose, paralyzed, or have restricted mobility. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves physical interaction with patients, which cannot be replaced by text-based interactions with an LLM. The task requires hands-on care and monitoring of the patient's physical response to exercise, which is beyond the capabilities of an LLM. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it involves physical actions and human interaction that cannot be replaced by text-based tools or LLMs.
