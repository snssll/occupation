1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of examining valves or mechanical control device parts for defects, dents, or loose attachments, and marking malfunctioning areas of defective units, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. In this task, the worker needs to visually inspect physical objects for defects, which cannot be done using text-based input alone. The task also involves physical interaction with machinery, which is not something the LLM can assist with. As such, this task does not fall under E1, E2, or E3 categories as it does not involve text-based input or image capabilities that the LLM can directly assist with.
