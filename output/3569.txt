1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of "Contact insured or other involved persons to obtain missing information" for Insurance Claims and Policy Processing Clerks, we need to consider how the task could be impacted by the use of a large language model (LLM).

- E1: Direct exposure - If the LLM can assist in drafting emails or messages to contact insured individuals or other involved parties, it could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality. The LLM could help in formulating clear and concise communication to request missing information.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the task itself may not be directly reducible to text generation, there could be additional software developed on top of the LLM that could streamline the process of contacting individuals, tracking responses, and organizing information obtained. This software could enhance the efficiency of communication and data collection.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities would not have a significant impact on this task as it primarily involves text-based communication with insured individuals and other parties. Therefore, image capabilities are not relevant in this context.
