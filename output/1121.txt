1: In this task, a Cost Estimator assesses the cost effectiveness of products, projects, or services by tracking actual costs relative to bids as the project develops. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves analyzing and comparing costs, which may require accessing and processing a large amount of data. An LLM could potentially assist in summarizing and analyzing cost data, providing insights into cost effectiveness, and even generating reports based on the information provided. However, the task also involves real-time tracking of costs as the project develops, which may require constant updates and monitoring that the LLM alone may not be able to provide. While the LLM can assist in data analysis and reporting, it may not be able to actively track real-time cost changes without additional software or tools. Therefore, this task falls under E2 as having access to the LLM alone may not reduce the time it takes to complete the task by at least half, but additional software could be developed to enhance the process.
