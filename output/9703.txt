1: In this task, an Atmospheric and Space Scientist is required to measure wind, temperature, and humidity in the upper atmosphere using weather balloons. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The LLM can provide information and insights based on existing data and knowledge, but it cannot physically measure atmospheric conditions using weather balloons. Since this task involves physical measurements and fieldwork, it falls under the category of tasks that cannot be directly performed by the LLM or any software built on top of it. Therefore, this task would be classified as E0 as it does not meet the criteria for exposure to LLM capabilities.

2: E0

3: High
