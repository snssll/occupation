1: In this task, a respiratory therapist works as part of a healthcare team to manage patient care by assisting with medical procedures or related duties. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if the task can be significantly expedited or improved by using the LLM. The LLM could potentially assist in providing information on medical procedures, guidelines, or best practices related to respiratory therapy. It could also help in generating reports, summarizing patient data, or even suggesting treatment options based on the input provided. However, since the task involves hands-on patient care and direct collaboration with other healthcare professionals, the LLM's role may be limited to providing information or recommendations rather than directly performing the duties of a respiratory therapist.
