1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of recommending legal or administrative action to protect government property as a Government Property Inspectors and Investigators, we need to consider the level of automation and assistance that the LLM can provide in completing this task.

- E1: Direct exposure - The task involves analyzing information related to government property and making recommendations based on legal or administrative considerations. The LLM can assist in providing relevant information, analyzing data, and even drafting recommendations based on the input provided. The task involves text input and output, which aligns well with the capabilities of the LLM. Therefore, the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone can assist in providing information and drafting recommendations, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to further streamline the process. This software could include capabilities to retrieve up-to-date legal information, analyze complex legal documents, and provide more specialized recommendations based on the specific legal or administrative context of government property protection.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not relevant for this task as it primarily involves text input and output related to legal and administrative actions for protecting government property.

Based on the above analysis, the task of recommending legal or administrative action to protect government property aligns best with the E1 label as the LLM can directly assist in completing the task with significant time savings.
