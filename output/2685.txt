1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of completing form letters in response to requests or problems identified by correspondence for Correspondence Clerks, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. In this task, the LLM can be used to generate text for form letters based on the specific requests or problems identified in the correspondence. The model can understand the context provided in the correspondence and generate appropriate responses efficiently. This task involves writing text based on input and does not require specialized domain knowledge or image capabilities. Therefore, the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality, making it suitable for an E1 label.
