1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of seeking out and learning new music suitable for live performance or recording as a musician or singer, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The LLM can assist in tasks related to writing, summarizing, providing feedback, answering questions, and maintaining records of written data. In this case, the task involves researching and discovering new music, which could potentially be aided by the LLM in finding information about new songs, artists, or genres. The LLM could help in summarizing information about music trends, providing feedback on potential songs, or even maintaining a database of music recommendations. However, the task also requires a level of creativity, personal taste, and musical expertise that may not be fully captured by the LLM. While the LLM can provide information and suggestions, the final decision on selecting music for performance or recording would likely still rely heavily on the musician or singer's judgment.
