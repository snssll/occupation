1: In this task, a Stocker or Order Filler is required to compare merchandise invoices to items received to ensure the accuracy of shipments. With the help of a large language model (LLM), the worker could potentially streamline this process by inputting the details from the invoice and the received items, then having the LLM assist in cross-referencing the information to identify any discrepancies. The LLM could also help in flagging any potential errors or mismatches, thereby aiding in the verification process. This task primarily involves text input and analysis, which aligns with the capabilities of the LLM.

Considering the nature of the task and the potential for the LLM to significantly reduce the time required for cross-referencing and verification, I would classify this task as E1 - Direct exposure.

2: E1

3: Moderate
