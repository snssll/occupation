1: In this task, the occupation involves pressers working with textile, garment, and related materials. The specific task mentioned is pushing and pulling irons over surfaces of articles to smooth or shape them. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM could significantly reduce the time it takes for an average worker to complete this task with high quality. 

Given the nature of the task which involves physical manipulation of irons over surfaces, it is clear that the task is manual and requires physical dexterity. The task does not involve complex decision-making, analysis, or information retrieval that could be significantly enhanced by the LLM. The LLM cannot physically interact with objects or perform tasks that require physical movement. Therefore, the task does not fall under E1, E2, or E3 exposure categories.

2: E0

3: High
