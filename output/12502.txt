1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of preparing drawings, estimates, and bids that meet specific customer needs for Sales Representatives, Wholesale and Manufacturing, Except Technical and Scientific Products, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves creating documents based on specific customer requirements, which can be achieved through text input and output within the 2000-word context limit of the LLM. The LLM can assist in generating text, providing feedback on documents, and maintaining records of written data, which align with the task requirements. However, the task does not involve complex databases, highly specialized domain knowledge, or up-to-date facts retrieval, which would require additional software beyond the LLM. Therefore, the task falls under E1 as the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality by providing text-based assistance.
