1: In this task, a Model Maker, Wood is responsible for finishing patterns or models with protective or decorative coatings like shellac, lacquer, or wax. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. This task involves applying coatings to wood models, which is a hands-on, physical task that requires manual dexterity and craftsmanship. The task does not involve text input or output, and the context is primarily related to woodworking techniques and materials. Since the task is hands-on and does not involve text-based interactions or data processing, it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM or any software tools built on top of it. Therefore, the task falls under E0 as it does not benefit from LLM exposure.

2: E0
