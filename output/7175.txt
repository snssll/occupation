1: In this task, the occupation involves providing facials to patrons using special compounds like lotions and creams. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes for an average worker to complete this task with equivalent quality. 

Hairdressing, hairstyling, and cosmetology tasks like giving facials involve hands-on skills, physical interaction with clients, and the use of specialized tools and products. The task does not primarily involve written or spoken communication, complex data analysis, or information retrieval that could be significantly expedited by the LLM. The LLM does not have the capability to physically apply lotions and creams to patrons or interact with them in person. Therefore, the task does not align with the capabilities of the LLM or any software that could be developed on top of it to reduce the time significantly.
