1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of investigating violations of solid waste or recycling ordinances as a Recycling Coordinator, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be completed with the help of an LLM.

- The task involves investigating violations, which may require researching relevant laws, regulations, and documentation related to solid waste and recycling.
- The LLM can assist in providing information on existing ordinances, regulations, and best practices in the field of waste management.
- The LLM can help in summarizing and synthesizing information from various sources to aid in the investigation process.
- The LLM can also assist in drafting reports or recommendations based on the findings of the investigation.

Based on these considerations, the task can benefit from the LLM's capabilities in providing information, summarizing documents, and assisting in writing reports. However, the task may not be significantly reduced in time by half solely with access to the LLM, as it involves a level of domain-specific knowledge and potentially interacting with physical environments (e.g., visiting sites of violations). Therefore, the task falls under label E2, as additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to further streamline the investigation process.
