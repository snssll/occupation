1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of monitoring industry statistics and following trends in trade literature as a Market Research Analyst or Marketing Specialist, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. In this task, the LLM can assist by summarizing trade literature, providing insights into industry statistics, and identifying emerging trends based on the information provided in the text. The LLM can also generate questions for further research or analysis based on the trends identified. However, the task does not involve any image processing or require access to up-to-date external data sources beyond what is provided in the text input.

Given that the task primarily involves text analysis, summarization, and generating insights from written information, it aligns more closely with E1 exposure. The LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to monitor industry statistics and follow trends by providing quick summaries, trend analysis, and generating relevant questions for further investigation.
