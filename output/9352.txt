1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of maintaining up-to-date knowledge of music releases and trends as a Disc Jockey, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The LLM can provide information on music releases and trends up to a year ago, but it cannot access real-time data unless it is provided in the input. In this case, the task requires staying current with the latest music releases and trends, which may include information within the past year. The LLM can assist in summarizing past trends and releases, but it cannot provide real-time updates without external input. Therefore, the task does not directly benefit from the LLM's capabilities to access up-to-date information beyond what is already available in the model.
