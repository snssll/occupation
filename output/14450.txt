1: In this task, the commercial divers are required to remove rubbish or pollution from the sea. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. Since this task involves physical work underwater to clean up the sea, it cannot be directly performed by an LLM or any software tool. The task requires manual labor, physical dexterity, and specialized equipment that cannot be replaced by text-based AI models. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM or any software tool based on it.
