1: Hazardous Materials Removal Workers are responsible for identifying and removing hazardous materials such as asbestos and lead. The task provided involves identifying these materials using monitoring devices. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality. In this case, the task involves practical, hands-on work that requires physical interaction with monitoring devices and hazardous materials. The task does not primarily involve text input or output that the LLM can process. Therefore, the LLM cannot directly assist in the physical identification of hazardous materials using monitoring devices. As a result, the task falls under E0 as it does not meet the criteria for exposure to the LLM.
