1: In this task, the Educational, Guidance, and Career Counselors and Advisors as well as Career/Technical Education Teachers are required to prepare students for future educational experiences by encouraging them to explore learning opportunities and persevere with challenging tasks. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task involves writing and transforming text, providing feedback, preparing training materials, or informing others of information. Since the task involves providing guidance and encouragement to students, it may involve writing personalized messages, preparing training materials related to motivation and perseverance, and potentially informing students about educational opportunities. These aspects can benefit from the language generation capabilities of the LLM, making the task more efficient and effective.
