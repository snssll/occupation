1: In this task, a Landscape Architect is required to provide follow-up consultations for clients to ensure landscape designs are maturing or developing as planned. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves communication with clients, understanding the progress of landscape designs, and providing guidance or adjustments as necessary.
- The task does not involve complex data analysis, specialized domain knowledge retrieval, or image processing.
- The task primarily revolves around written or spoken communication and does not require detailed visual analysis or physical interaction.

Based on these considerations, the task falls under E1 as it involves providing feedback, engaging in communication, and maintaining records of client consultations, all of which can be efficiently handled by an LLM through text-based interactions.
