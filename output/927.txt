1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of arranging and maintaining displays of optical merchandise for Opticians, Dispensing, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be aided by the use of a large language model (LLM).

- E1: Direct exposure - If the task involves creating detailed instructions for arranging and maintaining displays, the LLM could assist in generating these instructions efficiently. The LLM could also help in transforming text or code related to inventory management or display organization based on specific requirements.
- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time to complete the task, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to provide recommendations on optimal display arrangements based on trends, customer preferences, or inventory data. This software could analyze data to inform decisions on display layouts.
- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Since the task involves arranging displays of optical merchandise, having image capabilities could aid in creating or editing digital images of display setups. The LLM could provide text descriptions or instructions for these images.
