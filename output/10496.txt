1: In this task, the worker is required to observe machine operations, detect problems, and make adjustments to correct them. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if the task can be significantly enhanced by the use of the LLM. The LLM could potentially assist in providing troubleshooting guides, suggesting adjustments based on common issues, or offering detailed explanations for specific machine problems. However, since this task involves hands-on observation and physical adjustments to machinery, it is unlikely that the LLM alone or tools built on top of it could reduce the time it takes to complete the task by at least half. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not clearly benefit from LLM exposure.

2: E0

3: High
