1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of leading party games as a Disc Jockey, I will consider the nature of the task and how it can be completed with the help of an LLM. 

- E0: This task involves physical interaction and engagement with a live audience, which cannot be replaced by text-based interactions with an LLM. The task of leading party games requires real-time coordination, energy, and presence, which are not within the capabilities of an LLM.

- E1: While an LLM could potentially provide suggestions for party games or tips on how to engage an audience, the core aspect of leading party games, such as dance-offs or prize giveaways, heavily relies on physical presence and interaction. The dynamic nature of hosting such activities in real-time cannot be effectively replicated by an LLM alone.

- E2: It is conceivable that additional software could be developed on top of an LLM to assist in generating ideas for party games or providing tips on how to lead them. However, the fundamental aspect of physically leading and engaging with the audience in party games would still require human presence and interaction.

- E3: The task of leading party games does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images, which are the capabilities associated with E3 exposure.
