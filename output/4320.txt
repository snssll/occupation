1: In this task, a school psychologist is required to design classes and programs to meet the needs of special students. To complete this task, the school psychologist would need to have a deep understanding of the students' individual needs, learning styles, and challenges. They would also need to consider educational strategies, interventions, and accommodations that would best support these students. The task involves a high level of expertise in psychology, education, and special education.

Given the complexity and specialized knowledge required for this task, the most suitable exposure label would be E2. While the LLM can assist in providing general information on educational strategies and interventions, it may not have the specialized domain knowledge required to design classes and programs tailored to meet the specific needs of special students. However, it is easy to imagine additional software built on top of the LLM that could potentially analyze individual student data, recommend specific interventions, or provide insights based on the latest research in the field of special education, thereby reducing the time it takes to design classes and programs for special students.
