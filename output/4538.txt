1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of determining advertising medium and preparing sample advertisements, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves selecting an advertising medium and creating sample advertisements, which are primarily text-based activities. The LLM can assist in generating text, providing suggestions for advertising mediums based on input criteria, and even helping to draft sample advertisements. This task does not require specialized domain knowledge beyond general advertising concepts, which the LLM can handle. Therefore, the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality by providing text-based assistance.
