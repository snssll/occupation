1: In this task, a Funeral Attendant is required to offer assistance to mourners as they enter or exit limousines. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves providing support and assistance to individuals during a sensitive and emotional time. This task does not involve complex text processing, data analysis, or specialized knowledge that would significantly benefit from the capabilities of a large language model. The task is more focused on interpersonal skills, empathy, and physical assistance rather than information processing or analysis. Therefore, the task does not align with the capabilities of the LLM or any tools built on top of it. As a result, this task would be classified as E0 as it does not benefit from LLM exposure.

2: E0
