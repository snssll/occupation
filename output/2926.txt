1: In this task, an Art Therapist or Music Therapist is required to conduct information sharing sessions, such as workshops for other professionals, potential client groups, or the general community. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if the task can be significantly expedited or improved by using the LLM. 

- The task involves sharing information and conducting workshops, which primarily require interpersonal skills, knowledge of therapy techniques, and the ability to engage with the audience effectively.
- While the LLM can provide information and guidance on therapy techniques, it cannot replace the hands-on, interactive nature of conducting workshops.
- The LLM may assist in preparing materials for the workshop, such as handouts or presentations, but the core aspect of conducting the session relies heavily on human interaction and practical skills.
- The LLM cannot directly engage with the audience, adapt to their responses, or provide the nuanced emotional support that is often required in therapy sessions.

Based on these considerations, the task of conducting information sharing sessions as an Art Therapist or Music Therapist is best classified as E0 - No exposure to LLM.
