1: In this task, a Potter in Manufacturing needs to verify the accuracy of shapes and sizes of objects using calipers and templates. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality. The task involves physical measurements and hands-on work that cannot be directly replaced by text-based instructions or responses from the LLM. The LLM does not have the capability to perform physical measurements or interact with physical objects, so it cannot directly assist in verifying the accuracy of shapes and sizes of objects using calipers and templates. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not meet the criteria for exposure to LLM.

2: E0
