1: In this task, a Meat, Poultry, and Fish Cutter and Trimmer is responsible for cutting and trimming meat to prepare it for packing. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality. Since this task involves physical actions such as cutting and trimming meat, it cannot be directly completed using the LLM. The LLM does not have the capability to perform physical tasks or interact with physical objects. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not meet the criteria for exposure to the LLM.

2: E0

3: High
