1: In this task, the Excavating and Loading Machine and Dragline Operators are required to direct workers in placing blocks or outriggers to prevent capsizing of machines when lifting heavy loads. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be completed more efficiently with the help of the LLM. The task involves providing instructions and guidance to workers in a specific scenario, which requires hands-on supervision and physical presence. The task does not involve text input or output, complex instructions, data analysis, or decision-making based on information processed by the LLM. Therefore, the task does not align with the capabilities of the LLM, and using the LLM would not reduce the time it takes to complete the task.
