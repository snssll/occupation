1: For the task of operating large-volume cooking equipment as a Fast Food Cook, the exposure to LLM can be analyzed as follows:

- The task of operating cooking equipment does not involve text input or output, so direct interaction with the LLM through text-based interfaces like ChatGPT would not be applicable here.
- While it is possible to imagine software that could potentially aid in training or providing guidance on operating specific cooking equipment, the task itself is primarily hands-on and practical, requiring physical interaction with the equipment.
- The task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images, so the image capabilities of the LLM would not significantly impact the completion of this task.

Based on the analysis above, the task of operating large-volume cooking equipment as a Fast Food Cook would fall under E0 as the exposure to the LLM would not reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete the task with high quality by at least half.
