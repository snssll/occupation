1: In this task, the Bridge and Lock Tenders are responsible for observing the position and progress of vessels to ensure the best use of lock spaces or bridge opening spaces. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality. Since this task involves real-time observation and decision-making based on visual cues and interactions with vessels, it does not seem feasible for the LLM to directly assist in this process. The task requires physical presence, immediate action, and decision-making based on real-time events, which are not within the capabilities of the LLM.
