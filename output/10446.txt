1: In this task, a Dietetic Technician is required to observe and monitor patient food intake and body weight, and report changes, progress, and dietary problems to a dietician. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we can break down the task:
- Writing reports on patient food intake, body weight changes, progress, and dietary problems: This task involves transforming observations into written reports, which can be done efficiently by an LLM. The LLM can assist in summarizing the data and generating detailed reports.
- Communicating with a dietician: The LLM can help in drafting emails or messages to communicate the observed changes, progress, and problems effectively to the dietician.
- Maintaining records of patient data: The LLM can assist in organizing and maintaining records of patient food intake, body weight, and dietary problems.

Considering the above breakdown, this task involves a significant amount of writing, summarizing, and organizing data, which can be efficiently handled by an LLM. Therefore, this task falls under the E1 label as direct access to the LLM can reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality by at least half.
