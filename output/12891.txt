1: Environmental Engineers are responsible for tasks related to environmental protection, such as assessing environmental impacts, designing solutions to environmental problems, and ensuring compliance with regulations. One specific task they may perform is preparing, reviewing, or updating environmental investigation or recommendation reports. To determine the exposure level of this task to LLM, we can break it down as follows:

- **Writing and transforming text**: The task involves writing and potentially transforming text in the form of environmental investigation or recommendation reports. LLM can assist in generating, reviewing, or updating these reports based on the input provided.
- **Providing edits to existing text**: LLM can provide edits to existing reports, ensuring they are accurate, well-written, and comply with standards.
- **Summarizing medium-length documents**: LLM can help summarize lengthy environmental reports, making it easier for engineers to review and analyze the content efficiently.
- **Answering questions about documents**: LLM can answer questions related to the content of the reports, providing additional insights or clarifications.
- **Maintain records of written data**: LLM can assist in maintaining records of environmental reports, ensuring data is organized and easily accessible.

Considering these factors, the task of preparing, reviewing, or updating environmental investigation or recommendation reports can benefit significantly from LLM's capabilities, reducing the time and effort required to complete the task effectively.
