1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of assessing current or future customer needs and priorities as an Information Technology Project Manager, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be impacted by the use of the LLM.

- E1: Direct exposure - The task involves communicating directly with customers and conducting surveys to understand their needs. The LLM can assist in drafting survey questions, analyzing customer feedback, and even generating potential communication templates. This direct text-based interaction can be significantly enhanced by the LLM, reducing the time needed to craft effective communication and gather insights from customer interactions.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM can aid in text-based tasks related to customer communication and survey analysis, additional software could be developed to streamline the process further. For example, an application that integrates survey responses with customer data analysis and generates actionable insights could enhance the efficiency of assessing customer needs and priorities.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Since the task primarily involves text-based communication and survey analysis, image capabilities are not directly relevant to this task. Therefore, this task does not fall under E3.

Based on the above analysis, the task of assessing current or future customer needs and priorities as an Information Technology Project Manager aligns most closely with E1: Direct exposure.
