1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of performing descriptive and multivariate statistical analyses of data using computer software as a Social Science Research Assistant, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM can assist in writing and transforming text and code according to complex instructions, which could include generating statistical analysis reports based on provided data and criteria. The LLM can also help in providing edits to existing text or code following specifications, which could be useful in refining statistical analysis outputs. However, the LLM may not have the specific statistical analysis capabilities required for this task.
  
- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not have the statistical analysis capabilities needed for this task, it is easy to imagine additional software that could be developed on top of the LLM to perform statistical analyses. This software could potentially summarize the data, generate reports, and provide insights based on the analyses conducted by the LLM.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not directly relevant to performing statistical analyses of data using computer software, so this label is not applicable to this task.

Based on the above analysis, the task of performing descriptive and multivariate statistical analyses of data using computer software as a Social Science Research Assistant would best fit under E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications.
