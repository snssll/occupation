1: In this task, an air traffic controller is responsible for transferring control of departing flights to traffic control centers and accepting control of arriving flights. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves specific instructions and procedures that need to be followed accurately and efficiently. While the task involves some level of decision-making and coordination, it primarily revolves around following established protocols and guidelines.

Given that the task does not involve complex data analysis, specialized domain knowledge, or require the use of image capabilities, it is unlikely that access to the LLM alone would significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task. The task is more operational and procedural in nature, focusing on real-time coordination and communication in a high-stakes environment. Therefore, the task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM to provide a substantial time-saving benefit.
