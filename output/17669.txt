1: In this task, a Real Estate Sales Agent is required to visit properties to assess them before showing them to clients. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone or with additional software could significantly reduce the time it takes for a Real Estate Sales Agent to complete this task with high quality.

- E0: This task involves physical presence and assessment of properties, which cannot be replaced by the LLM or any software. The task requires on-site evaluation, which is not something the LLM can assist with.

- E1: The LLM could potentially assist in preparing reports or summaries based on the agent's observations during property visits. It could help in documenting details, generating reports, or even suggesting questions to ask during the assessment. However, the core task of physically visiting properties and assessing them cannot be directly replaced by the LLM.

- E2: While the LLM alone may not reduce the time significantly for this task, additional software could be developed to streamline the reporting process after property visits. This software could potentially automate report generation, provide insights based on the agent's observations, or even assist in comparing different properties based on the assessments.

- E3: Image capabilities could potentially be used to capture and annotate images of the properties during the visit. These images could then be used for documentation or comparison purposes. However, the LLM's text capabilities would still have limited impact on the core task of physically assessing properties.
