1: In this task, a Stone Cutter and Carver in manufacturing needs to select the appropriate tools like chisels, pneumatic or surfacing tools, or sandblasting nozzles, and determine the sequence of their use. To determine the label that best fits this task's exposure to LLM, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves selecting tools based on specific requirements and determining the order of their use, which requires a practical understanding of stone cutting and carving techniques. While an LLM could potentially provide information on different types of tools and their uses, it may not have the practical experience or expertise to make informed decisions about tool selection and sequencing in a manufacturing setting. Therefore, the task does not seem to align with the capabilities of an LLM to significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete the task with high quality.
