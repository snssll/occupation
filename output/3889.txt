1: In this task, the occupation of Tapers involves preparing surfaces for finishing by countersinking nails or screws. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality. The task involves physical actions such as using hammers or screwdrivers, which cannot be directly replaced by the LLM. The LLM does not have the capability to perform physical tasks or interact with physical objects. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not meet the criteria for exposure to LLM capabilities.

2: E0

3: High
