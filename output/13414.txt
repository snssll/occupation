1: In this task, a psychiatric aide is required to provide patients with assistance in bathing, dressing, or grooming, demonstrating these skills as necessary. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM could significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality by at least half.

- Direct exposure (E1): The task of providing physical assistance in bathing, dressing, or grooming patients involves hands-on care that cannot be replaced by text-based interactions with the LLM. The LLM cannot physically assist patients, so it cannot directly reduce the time it takes to complete this task.

- Exposure by LLM-powered applications (E2): While the LLM may not directly assist in providing physical care, it could potentially be used to generate training materials, informational guides, or documentation related to patient care procedures. However, the direct task of assisting patients in bathing, dressing, or grooming would not be significantly impacted by the LLM alone.

- Exposure given image capabilities (E3): Image capabilities would not be relevant for this task as it involves physical care tasks that cannot be captured through images or text alone.

Based on the analysis above, the task of providing patients with assistance in bathing, dressing, or grooming as a psychiatric aide would be classified as E0, as the LLM and its capabilities would not significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task.

2: E0
