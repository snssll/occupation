1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of performing marketing and advertising services as a Host or Hostess in a restaurant, lounge, or coffee shop, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves creating promotional content, designing marketing strategies, and potentially interacting with customers to promote the establishment. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM can assist in generating marketing content, drafting advertising copy, and providing ideas for marketing strategies. It can help in crafting engaging messages and potentially even suggest creative approaches to attract customers. The task involves a significant amount of text-based work, which the LLM can streamline and enhance.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM can assist in generating content and ideas, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to automate the distribution of marketing materials, analyze customer feedback, or provide real-time insights into marketing trends. Such software could further streamline the marketing and advertising process for Hosts and Hostesses.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Since the task primarily involves text-based marketing and advertising services, the image capabilities of the LLM are not directly relevant in this context.

Considering the above points, the task of performing marketing and advertising services as a Host or Hostess in a restaurant, lounge, or coffee shop would likely fall under **E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications**. While the LLM can assist in generating content and ideas, additional software could enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of marketing efforts in this role.
