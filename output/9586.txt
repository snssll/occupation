1: In this task, an Electrical and Electronic Equipment Assembler is required to measure and adjust voltages to specified values to determine the operational accuracy of instruments. This task involves technical knowledge and skills related to electrical systems and equipment. While an LLM could potentially provide information on general electrical principles and procedures, it is unlikely to significantly reduce the time it takes to physically measure and adjust voltages in real-world instruments. The task also involves hands-on work that cannot be directly performed by the LLM. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not meet the criteria for exposure to LLM capabilities.

2: E0
