1: In this task, the Cutting and Slicing Machine Setters, Operators, and Tenders need to type instructions on computer keyboards, push buttons to activate computer programs, or manually set cutting guides, clamps, and knives. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we can break down the task:
- Typing instructions on computer keyboards: This can be done efficiently using an LLM to generate text based on the given instructions.
- Pushing buttons to activate computer programs: This task may not directly benefit from LLM capabilities as it involves physical interaction with the machine.
- Manually setting cutting guides, clamps, and knives: This task is hands-on and requires physical manipulation, which is not something an LLM can assist with.

Considering the task involves a mix of activities where only one part can benefit from LLM assistance, it falls under E2 exposure. While the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time to complete the entire task, additional software could be developed to streamline the typing instructions part, thus potentially reducing the overall time by half.
