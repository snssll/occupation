1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of attending or participating in conferences, community events, and promotional events related to products or technologies as an Advertising and Promotions Manager, we need to consider the nature of the task and how LLM exposure could impact it.

- E0: This task involves physical presence and human interaction, which cannot be replaced by LLM capabilities. LLMs cannot attend events or interact with people in person, so this task would not benefit from LLM exposure.

- E1: LLMs can assist in preparing for these events by providing written materials, drafting speeches or presentations, or even generating promotional content. However, the core task of physically attending or participating in events cannot be directly performed by an LLM.

- E2: While LLMs could potentially help in researching event details, generating promotional strategies, or analyzing data post-event, the direct participation in events still requires human presence. Additional software could be developed to streamline event planning and post-event analysis, but the core task of attending events remains outside the scope of LLM capabilities.

- E3: LLMs do not have image capabilities that would significantly impact the task of attending events. Image capabilities would not change the fundamental nature of physically attending events.
