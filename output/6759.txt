1: In this task of executing or managing banner, video, or other non-text link ad campaigns as a Search Marketing Strategist, the primary focus is on creating and optimizing visual advertisements rather than text-based content. While the LLM can assist with generating text-based content, it may not be as effective in directly creating or managing visual ad campaigns. However, the LLM could potentially be used to generate ad copy, analyze data to inform campaign decisions, or provide recommendations based on text inputs related to the ad campaigns. Therefore, the task could benefit from additional software that could be developed on top of the LLM to assist in analyzing ad performance data, generating ad copy, or providing strategic recommendations for ad campaigns.
