1: In this task, a Demonstrator or Product Promoter is required to visit various venues to demonstrate products or services and answer questions from potential customers. With access to the LLM, the worker could potentially use the model to prepare scripts for product demonstrations, draft responses to common customer questions, or even generate promotional materials. The LLM could assist in creating engaging and informative content to showcase products effectively. However, the task primarily involves in-person interaction and physical demonstrations, which cannot be directly replaced by the LLM. While the LLM could aid in preparing materials or responses, the core aspect of physically demonstrating products and engaging with customers in real-time remains outside the capabilities of the model. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as the LLM does not significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete the task with high quality.
