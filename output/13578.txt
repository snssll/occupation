1: In this task, a Tire Builder is responsible for pulling plies from supply racks and aligning them with the edges of drums. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves physical actions such as pulling plies and aligning them, which cannot be directly performed by an LLM. The task does not involve complex written instructions, data analysis, or information retrieval that could benefit significantly from LLM capabilities. Therefore, this task does not align with any of the exposure levels in the rubric.

2: E0

3: High
