1: In this task for Surveying and Mapping Technicians, the main activity involves researching and combining existing property information to describe property boundaries in relation to adjacent properties. This task requires analyzing various documents, maps, and legal descriptions to accurately determine property boundaries. The task involves a significant amount of data processing, interpretation, and synthesis of information.

Considering the nature of the task, the most suitable label from the exposure rubric would be E2 - Exposure by LLM-powered applications. While the LLM alone may not reduce the time it takes to complete the task by at least half, it is easy to imagine additional software that could be developed on top of the LLM to streamline the process. This software could potentially assist in summarizing complex legal descriptions, retrieving up-to-date property information, and providing recommendations based on the data analyzed.
