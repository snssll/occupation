1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of performing routine network startup and shutdown procedures and maintaining control records as a Network and Computer Systems Administrator, we need to consider the nature of the task and how an LLM could potentially assist in completing it.

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** An LLM could assist in providing guidance on specific startup and shutdown procedures, generating templates for control records, or offering troubleshooting tips for common issues related to network maintenance. The LLM could help in writing detailed instructions or summaries related to these procedures, which could significantly reduce the time needed to complete the task with equivalent quality.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While an LLM alone may not reduce the time to complete the task by half, additional software built on top of the LLM could be developed to automate routine network startup and shutdown procedures based on predefined rules or triggers. This software could also integrate with existing network monitoring tools to maintain control records automatically, thereby streamlining the process.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Image capabilities would not significantly impact the completion of this task as it primarily involves text-based procedures and record-keeping in a network environment. The task does not require image analysis or creation, so the addition of image capabilities would not provide a substantial advantage in this context.
