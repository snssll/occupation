1: In this task, the main actions involve setting oven temperatures and placing items into hot ovens for baking. These actions are physical and hands-on, requiring the baker to interact directly with the oven and baking items. The task does not involve complex decision-making, analysis, or information retrieval that would benefit significantly from the use of an LLM. The LLM cannot physically set oven temperatures or place items into ovens, and there are no written instructions or data analysis involved that would require the LLM's capabilities. Therefore, this task does not align with any of the exposure levels in the rubric.
