1: In this task, a Software Quality Assurance Analyst is required to monitor bug resolution efforts and track successes. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we can break down the task:
- Monitoring bug resolution efforts involves tracking the progress of identifying and fixing software bugs. This task can involve analyzing reports, communicating with developers, and ensuring that issues are being addressed in a timely manner.
- Tracking successes would involve keeping records of resolved bugs, identifying patterns in successful resolutions, and potentially providing feedback to improve the bug resolution process.

Given the nature of the task, it primarily involves working with text data, analyzing information, and maintaining records. The task does not require specialized domain knowledge beyond software testing and quality assurance concepts. The task can be effectively completed using the LLM to assist in writing reports, analyzing bug resolution data, and maintaining records.
