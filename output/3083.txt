1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of conducting research to obtain factual information and authentic detail as a Poet, Lyricist, or Creative Writer, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. In this task, the LLM can assist in various ways:

- The LLM can help in summarizing and analyzing information from various sources such as newspaper accounts, diaries, and interviews, providing a concise overview of the key points.
- It can generate questions based on the information gathered, helping to identify gaps in the research or areas that need further exploration.
- The LLM can also assist in organizing and structuring the gathered information, making it easier for the writer to incorporate into their creative work.

Considering these points, the task can be significantly expedited and enhanced with the assistance of the LLM, reducing the time and effort required to conduct research effectively.
