1: In this task, a First-Line Supervisor of Farming, Fishing, and Forestry Workers is required to train workers in various methods related to farming, fishing, and forestry activities. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves providing training on specific techniques and equipment usage, which can be explained through text instructions. The LLM can assist in generating detailed training materials based on general knowledge related to farming, fishing, and forestry practices. The model can help in summarizing key points, creating step-by-step guides, and explaining the use of equipment. Therefore, this task falls under E1 as the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to prepare training materials and instructions for workers.
