1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of investigating customer or public complaints as an Electrical Engineer, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be aided by the use of a large language model (LLM).

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** If the task involves analyzing text-based complaints, understanding the issues raised, and formulating responses or solutions based on the information provided in the complaints, then direct access to the LLM could significantly reduce the time it takes to process and respond to these complaints. The LLM can help in understanding the context, identifying potential solutions, and drafting appropriate responses.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the LLM alone may not reduce the time it takes to investigate complaints by half, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to streamline the process. For example, an application that can summarize multiple complaints, extract key issues, and suggest potential solutions could enhance the efficiency of the investigation process.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Image capabilities are not directly relevant to investigating text-based complaints, so this label is not applicable to this task.

Considering the above points, the task of investigating customer or public complaints as an Electrical Engineer could be best classified as **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications)**.
