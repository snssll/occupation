1: In this task for Agricultural Technicians, the main responsibility is to conduct studies on nitrogen or alternative fertilizer application methods to meet crop needs effectively while minimizing environmental impact. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be significantly expedited or improved by using the language model. 

- The task involves conducting studies, which may require analyzing data, designing experiments, and interpreting results. While the LLM can assist in providing information on fertilizer application methods and their effects on crops, it may not directly replace the hands-on work required for conducting studies.
- The LLM can help in researching and summarizing existing studies on fertilizer application methods, which could save time in literature review.
- However, the task also involves practical aspects like fieldwork, data collection, and experimentation, which the LLM cannot perform.
- The LLM may not have access to real-time data on specific crop conditions or environmental factors, which are crucial for conducting accurate studies in agriculture.
