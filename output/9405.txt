1: In this task, a Legal Secretary or Administrative Assistant is required to make photocopies of correspondence, documents, and other printed matter. This task involves a straightforward and repetitive action that does not require complex decision-making or specialized knowledge. The task can be easily automated using existing technology like photocopiers or document scanners. While an LLM could potentially be used to provide instructions on how to operate the photocopier or scanner, the task itself does not involve any text input or output that would benefit significantly from the LLM's capabilities. Therefore, the task does not fall under E1, E2, or E3 exposure levels as it does not involve text transformation, complex decision-making, or image processing beyond what is commonly available.
