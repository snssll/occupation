1: In this task, a Stone Cutter and Carver is required to carve designs or figures in stone based on designers' plans. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves a high level of manual skill, artistry, and knowledge of stone carving techniques. While an LLM could potentially provide information on stone carving techniques or artistic styles, it cannot physically carve the stone. The task does not involve text input or output that the LLM can directly assist with. Therefore, the task does not fall under E1, E2, or E3 categories as the LLM cannot significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task.

2: E0

3: High
