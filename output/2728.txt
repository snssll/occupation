1: In this task, the musician or singer is required to compose songs or create vocal arrangements. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The LLM can assist in generating text, including lyrics, melodies, and arrangements based on the input provided. It can also help in refining existing compositions, suggesting variations, and providing creative ideas. Given that the task involves text input (lyrics, musical notes) and output (compositions, arrangements), the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task by providing creative input and suggestions.

Considering the LLM's ability to assist in composing songs and creating vocal arrangements, it falls under the category of tasks that involve writing and transforming text according to complex instructions. The LLM can provide valuable insights, suggestions, and even generate parts of the composition, thereby enhancing the creative process for musicians and singers.
