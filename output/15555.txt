1: In this task, a Gem and Diamond Worker is required to select shaping wheels for specific tasks and mix and apply abrasives, bort, or polishing compounds. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. This task involves physical actions such as selecting shaping wheels and mixing and applying substances, which cannot be directly performed by an LLM. The task also requires specialized knowledge about gemstones, diamonds, abrasives, and polishing compounds, which may not be readily available to the LLM. As a result, this task falls under the category of manual work that cannot be significantly aided by the LLM or any tools built on top of it. Therefore, this task is best classified as E0 - No exposure.

2: E0
