1: In this task, a recreation worker is required to direct special activities or events, such as aquatics, gymnastics, or performing arts. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if the task can be significantly aided by the use of the LLM. The task involves organizing and overseeing recreational activities, which may require creativity, interpersonal skills, and hands-on management. While the LLM could potentially provide some general information or ideas related to these activities, it may not be able to fully replace the practical skills and human interaction needed to effectively direct such events. Therefore, it is unlikely that the LLM alone or any software built on top of it could reduce the time it takes to complete this task by at least half.
