1: In this task, a Stocker and Order Filler is responsible for itemizing and totaling customer merchandise selections at the checkout counter, using a cash register, and accepting cash or charge card payments. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves basic calculations, itemizing products, and processing payments, which are routine and do not require complex decision-making or specialized knowledge beyond basic math skills. The task is primarily focused on following a set process and does not involve highly specialized domain knowledge or complex databases. Therefore, the task does not significantly benefit from the capabilities of an LLM beyond basic text processing.
