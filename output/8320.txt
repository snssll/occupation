1: In this task, the Physical Therapist Assistants are required to instruct, motivate, safeguard, and assist patients as they practice exercises or functional activities. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes for a Physical Therapist Assistant to complete this task with equivalent quality. Since this task involves physical interaction with patients, which cannot be replaced by text-based instructions or responses from the LLM, it is unlikely that the LLM can directly assist in completing this task. The task requires hands-on guidance and supervision, which cannot be provided by the LLM. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not meet the criteria for exposure to LLM capabilities.
