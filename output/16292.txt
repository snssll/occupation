1: In this task, an Entertainment and Recreation Manager is responsible for storing and retrieving equipment such as vehicles, radios, and ride components. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone or additional software could significantly reduce the time it takes for an average worker to complete this task with equivalent quality.

- E0: This task involves physical actions of storing and retrieving equipment, which cannot be directly assisted by the LLM or any software tools built on top of it. The task also does not involve complex decision-making or specialized knowledge that the LLM could provide.

- E1: The task does not involve writing, transforming text, summarizing documents, or any other text-based activities that the LLM could directly assist with. The core of the task is physical in nature, and the LLM's capabilities are not directly applicable here.

- E2: While it's conceivable that software could be developed to track and manage equipment inventory, the core task of physically storing and retrieving equipment would not be significantly impacted by the LLM alone. The LLM's text-based capabilities are not the primary focus of this task.

- E3: The task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images. The physical aspect of storing and retrieving equipment is the main component of this task, which is not directly related to the image capabilities of the LLM.
