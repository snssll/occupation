1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of evaluating, diagnosing, or treating genetic diseases as a geneticist, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The LLM can provide information on genetic diseases, their symptoms, diagnostic methods, and treatment options based on existing knowledge within the 2000-word context. However, the task of evaluating, diagnosing, or treating genetic diseases requires specialized domain knowledge, expertise, and access to up-to-date information, which the LLM may not have on its own. While the LLM can assist in providing general information and potentially generating hypotheses, it cannot replace the expertise and experience required for this task. Therefore, this task falls under E2 - Exposure by LLM-powered applications, as additional software could be developed to provide recommendations or analyze written information to inform decisions in the field of genetic diseases.
