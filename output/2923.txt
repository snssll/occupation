1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of conducting individual assessments as an Industrial-Organizational Psychologist, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be supported by the capabilities of the LLM.

- Conducting individual assessments involves analyzing data, interpreting measures, and providing feedback based on psychological principles. The LLM can assist in generating reports, analyzing text-based data, and providing insights based on the information provided.
- The task does not involve precise measurements or detailed visual analysis, which are limitations of the LLM.
- While the LLM can help in generating written content and potentially providing insights based on the data provided, it may not significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced Industrial-Organizational Psychologist to complete the task, as human judgment and expertise are crucial in this domain.

Based on these considerations, the task of conducting individual assessments as an Industrial-Organizational Psychologist would likely fall under label E2 - Exposure by LLM-powered applications. While the LLM can support aspects of the task, additional software tailored to the specific needs of Industrial-Organizational Psychologists could further enhance the efficiency of completing such assessments.
