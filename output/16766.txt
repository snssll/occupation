1: For the task of teaching a variety of subjects as a short-term substitute teacher, the exposure to LLM can be analyzed as follows:

- E0: This task involves human interaction, real-time adaptation to students' needs, and requires physical presence in the classroom. LLM cannot replace the hands-on teaching and interaction required for this task.

- E1: LLM could potentially assist in providing lesson plans, resources, or explanations for specific topics within English, mathematics, or social studies. It could also help in generating quiz questions or providing additional information on certain subjects. However, the direct impact on reducing the time it takes to teach a variety of subjects as a substitute teacher may not be significant.

- E2: While LLM could potentially be used to summarize educational materials, provide additional information on specific topics, or even generate lesson plans, the development of a specialized software tool that integrates LLM capabilities with educational content could potentially reduce the time it takes to prepare for teaching different subjects as a substitute teacher.

- E3: The task of teaching a variety of subjects does not involve image processing or detailed visual information, so the image capabilities of LLM would not significantly impact the time it takes to complete this task.
