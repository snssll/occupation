1: In this task, a farmworker is required to move containerized shrubs, plants, and trees using wheelbarrows or tractors. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. Since the task involves physical labor such as moving heavy objects, it does not involve text input or output that can be processed by an LLM. The task also does not involve complex instructions, writing, summarizing, or any other text-based activities that could benefit from LLM capabilities. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM.

2: E0
