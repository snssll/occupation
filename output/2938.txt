1: In this task, an embalmer conducts interviews to arrange for various aspects related to funeral arrangements. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be significantly aided by the language model. The task involves conducting interviews, which requires human interaction, empathy, and understanding of the emotional needs of the bereaved. While the LLM can assist in drafting written communication or providing information, the core aspect of conducting interviews and making sensitive decisions based on emotional cues is not something the LLM can effectively replace. Therefore, the task does not align with the capabilities of the LLM in a way that would significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced embalmer to complete it.
