1: In this task, the main activity involves preparing containers of semen for freezing and storage or shipment, which requires specific knowledge and skills related to animal breeding and reproductive technologies. While the task itself does not involve complex decision-making or highly specialized domain knowledge beyond the scope of animal breeding, it does require manual dexterity and physical handling of materials like dry ice or liquid nitrogen. The task description does not indicate a need for extensive written or spoken communication, translation, summarization, or data analysis that could be significantly enhanced by an LLM. Therefore, the task seems to fall under E0 as it does not clearly benefit from LLM capabilities.

2: E0
