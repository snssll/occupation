1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of monitoring building security and safety as a Janitor or Cleaner, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be supported by the capabilities of the LLM. In this case, the task involves performing routine checks to ensure the safety and security of a building, such as locking doors and checking electrical appliances. The task does not require complex decision-making or specialized domain knowledge beyond basic safety procedures.

Given that the task primarily involves following standard operating procedures and does not require specialized knowledge that the LLM could provide, it is unlikely that direct access to the LLM would significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task. While the LLM could potentially provide information on general safety protocols, the task itself is more practical and hands-on, involving physical checks and actions that cannot be directly automated by the LLM.
