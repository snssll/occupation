1: In this task, a Light Truck Driver is required to sell products from their truck inventory and keep records of sales. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be impacted by the capabilities of the LLM. 

- The task involves selling products and keeping records, which primarily requires physical interaction and record-keeping skills.
- While the LLM can assist in generating written records or providing information on sales techniques, the core aspect of physically selling products from a truck inventory cannot be directly influenced by the LLM.
- The task does not involve complex data analysis, specialized domain knowledge, or image processing that would significantly benefit from LLM capabilities.

Based on these considerations, the task of selling products from truck inventory and keeping records of sales is best classified as E0 - No exposure to LLM.
