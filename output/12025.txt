1: Morticians, undertakers, and funeral arrangers are professionals who handle various aspects of funeral services, including planning the logistics of the funeral site. The task provided involves planning the placement of caskets at funeral sites or adjusting various elements like lights, fixtures, or floral displays. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider whether access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality.

- Direct exposure (E1): The task of planning the placement of caskets or adjusting funeral site elements involves specific instructions and details that may not be easily generated by the LLM alone. While the LLM can provide general information or suggestions, the task requires practical knowledge and expertise in funeral arrangements that may not be effectively replaced by the LLM.

- Exposure by LLM-powered applications (E2): It is conceivable that additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to assist with tasks related to funeral arrangements, such as generating layout suggestions based on input criteria or providing creative ideas for floral displays. However, the specialized nature of this occupation and the need for hands-on, real-world adjustments may limit the extent to which the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time needed to complete the task.

- Exposure given image capabilities (E3): The task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images. Therefore, the image capabilities provided by the LLM are not directly relevant to this task.

Based on the considerations above, the task of planning the placement of caskets at funeral sites or adjusting lights, fixtures, or floral displays is best classified as E2 - Exposure by LLM-powered applications.
