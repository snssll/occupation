1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of creating and enforcing database development standards as a Database Architect, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be impacted by the use of the OpenAI large language model (LLM).

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM can assist in writing and transforming text and code according to complex instructions. In this case, the LLM could potentially help in drafting database development standards based on provided guidelines and requirements. It can also assist in refining and revising these standards as needed.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time to complete the task, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to streamline the process. This software could automate the enforcement of database development standards, provide recommendations based on best practices, and analyze existing standards to suggest improvements.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not relevant for this task as it primarily involves text-based work related to database development standards. Therefore, this label does not apply.

Based on the above analysis, the task of creating and enforcing database development standards as a Database Architect falls under E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications.

2: E2

3: Moderate
