1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of developing or implementing environmental protection programs as a Construction Manager, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be supported by the capabilities of the LLM. 

- E0: This task involves a high degree of human interaction and decision-making that requires specialized knowledge and expertise in environmental protection programs. The task may involve legal regulations, stakeholder engagement, and complex environmental considerations that cannot be effectively handled by the LLM alone.

- E1: While the LLM can provide information on environmental protection programs and regulations, it may not have the specialized domain knowledge required to develop or implement these programs effectively. The task involves more than just providing information or writing text; it requires strategic planning, decision-making, and coordination with various stakeholders.

- E2: With additional software development, it is conceivable that tools could be created to assist Construction Managers in developing or implementing environmental protection programs more efficiently. These tools could leverage the LLM's capabilities to analyze data, provide recommendations, and generate reports based on input from the Construction Manager.

- E3: The task does not involve image processing or detailed visual analysis, so the image capabilities of the LLM are not directly relevant to this task.
