1: In this task, the occupation involves coaching and instructing individuals or groups in sports rules, game strategies, and performance principles. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be significantly aided by the use of the language model. The task involves providing instructions on specific ways of moving the body, hands, or feet to achieve desired results. An LLM could potentially assist in generating detailed explanations, breaking down complex movements, providing examples, and offering alternative strategies. However, coaching also involves physical demonstrations, real-time feedback, and personalized interactions, which are not within the capabilities of the LLM. While the model can provide theoretical knowledge and general strategies, it cannot replace the hands-on, interactive nature of coaching.
