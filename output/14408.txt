1: In this task, a Metal-Refining Furnace Operator and Tender is required to remove impurities from the surface of molten metal using strainers. This task involves a physical action of using strainers to remove impurities, which cannot be directly performed by an LLM. The task does not involve complex decision-making, analysis, or information retrieval that would significantly benefit from LLM capabilities. Therefore, this task does not align with any of the exposure levels in the rubric.
