1: In this task, the occupation involves teaching and explaining the rules and regulations of a specific sport. To complete this task, the individual needs to have a deep understanding of the sport, its rules, and how they are applied in different situations. The task does not involve direct text input or output that can be easily automated by an LLM. While an LLM could potentially provide information on the rules and regulations of a specific sport, the task of teaching and explaining these rules requires human interaction, interpretation, and practical examples that go beyond what an LLM can provide. Therefore, this task does not fit into any of the exposure categories (E0, E1, E2, E3) as it does not align with the capabilities of an LLM.
