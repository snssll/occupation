1: In this task, an insurance sales agent needs to customize insurance programs for individual customers, considering various risks. To complete this task, the agent would need to analyze the customer's needs, assess potential risks, and tailor insurance solutions accordingly. The task involves understanding customer requirements, evaluating risk factors, and recommending suitable insurance coverage.

Considering the task description, the exposure to LLM can be categorized as follows:
- E1: Direct access to the LLM could assist in generating tailored insurance program options based on customer profiles and risk assessments. The LLM could help in drafting personalized insurance proposals and recommendations, potentially speeding up the process of customizing insurance programs.
- E2: While an LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time to complete the task, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to provide more detailed risk analysis, market trends, and personalized insurance suggestions based on real-time data. This software could enhance the agent's ability to customize insurance programs efficiently.
