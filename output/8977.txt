1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of lowering table-mounted cutters to cut items to specified sizes as a Cutter and Trimmer, Hand, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it.

- E1: Direct exposure - The task involves a specific and straightforward action of using table-mounted cutters to cut items to specified sizes. The LLM could potentially assist in providing detailed instructions on how to adjust the cutters for different sizes or troubleshoot common issues that may arise during the cutting process. The LLM could also help in generating safety guidelines or best practices for using the cutters effectively.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the task itself may not be significantly enhanced by just the LLM alone, additional software could be developed to provide real-time feedback on the cutting process, suggest optimal cutting techniques based on material types, or even simulate cutting scenarios to test different approaches. This additional software could leverage the LLM's capabilities to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of the cutting process.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Since the task involves physical actions of lowering table-mounted cutters, it does not directly benefit from image capabilities. The task is more focused on manual dexterity and precision in operating the cutters rather than visual analysis or image creation.
