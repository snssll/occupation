1: In this task, a Mining and Geological Engineer is required to inspect mining areas for unsafe structures, equipment, and working conditions. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be significantly aided by the use of the language model. The task involves on-site inspection, which requires physical presence and interaction with the environment. LLMs are not capable of physical inspection or interacting with real-world objects. While the LLM could potentially provide information on safety guidelines, regulations, or best practices related to mining safety, it cannot directly inspect mining areas for unsafe conditions. Therefore, the task does not align with the capabilities of LLMs, and no exposure to LLM is applicable.
