1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of processing loan applications as a New Accounts Clerk, we need to consider the level of exposure to LLM.

- E1: Direct exposure - If the task involves writing and transforming text (loan application details), providing edits to existing text (loan application forms), or answering questions about the loan application process, the LLM could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality by at least half.
- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - If there were additional software developed on top of the LLM that could summarize loan application documents, retrieve up-to-date financial information, or provide recommendations based on the loan application data, it could potentially reduce the time to complete the task by half.
- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Since the task of processing loan applications primarily involves text-based information (financial documents, application forms), and not detailed visual information, image capabilities would not significantly impact the time it takes to complete the task.

Considering the nature of the task of processing loan applications for New Accounts Clerks, the most suitable label appears to be E2. While the task may not directly benefit from the LLM alone reducing the time by half, the development of additional software leveraging the LLM's capabilities could enhance the efficiency of processing loan applications.
