1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of maintaining knowledge of community services and resources available to patients as a Patient Representative, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be aided by the use of the LLM.

- Patient Representatives need to stay updated on various community services and resources to effectively assist patients.
- The task involves gathering, organizing, and updating information on available services, which can be time-consuming and require continuous effort to ensure accuracy.
- The LLM can assist by quickly summarizing information from various sources, providing updates on new services, and helping in organizing and maintaining a database of resources.
- While the LLM can aid in researching and summarizing information, it may not significantly reduce the time required for the task, as the task involves ongoing monitoring and updating of resources, which may require human judgment and verification.
