1: In this task, a Structural Metal Fabricator and Fitter is required to lay out and examine metal stock or workpieces to ensure they meet specifications. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone or with additional software could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task.

- E0: This task involves physical examination and measurement of metal stock, which cannot be done by the LLM or any software tool. Therefore, this task does not fit into any of the exposure categories as it cannot be completed using text-based tools alone.

2: E0
