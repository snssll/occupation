1: In this task, the main responsibility is to cool products after processing to prevent distortion. This task involves understanding the processing requirements of different metal and plastic products, determining the appropriate cooling methods, and ensuring that the products are cooled effectively to maintain their shape and quality. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be significantly aided by the use of the language model. 

- The task does not involve complex text input or output that would require the LLM's text generation capabilities.
- The task is more hands-on and practical, involving physical processes like cooling products, which cannot be directly assisted by the LLM.
- While the LLM could potentially provide information on cooling methods or materials properties, the task itself does not primarily rely on text-based information retrieval or generation.

Based on these considerations, it is unlikely that the task of cooling products after processing to prevent distortion would be significantly impacted by the use of the LLM, as the core aspects of the task are practical and hands-on in nature.
