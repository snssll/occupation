1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of "Determining which sites and violation reports to investigate, and coordinating compliance and enforcement activities with other government agencies" for Environmental Compliance Inspectors, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be aided by the use of a large language model (LLM).

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** If the task involves analyzing text data such as violation reports, coordinating activities, and making decisions based on the information provided, the LLM could significantly reduce the time needed to process and prioritize the sites and reports for investigation. The LLM can assist in summarizing reports, providing insights, and even suggesting potential courses of action based on the data provided.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the task may not be directly reducible to text-based interactions, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to streamline the process of analyzing reports, identifying key areas for investigation, and recommending compliance actions. This software could leverage the LLM's capabilities to process and interpret large amounts of textual data efficiently.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Since the task primarily involves text-based information and coordination activities with other agencies, the use of image capabilities would not significantly impact the completion of the task. Therefore, this task does not fall under E3.
