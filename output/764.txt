1: In this task, a Parking Enforcement Worker is required to appear in court at hearings regarding contested traffic citations. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it. 

- E0: This task involves a high degree of human interaction and legal proceedings, which cannot be effectively replaced by the LLM. The LLM cannot physically appear in court or represent the Parking Enforcement Worker.
- E1: The LLM could potentially assist in preparing written statements or responses for the court appearance. It could help in drafting legal documents or responses to questions that may arise during the hearing.
- E2: While the LLM could potentially aid in summarizing legal documents or providing background information on traffic laws, it may not significantly reduce the time it takes to prepare for a court appearance.
- E3: The task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images, so image capabilities would not significantly impact the completion of this task.
