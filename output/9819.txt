1: For the task of mixing ingredients, such as pancake or waffle batters, with the help of an LLM, we can consider the following steps to determine the appropriate exposure label:

- **E0 (No exposure):** This task involves physical actions such as mixing ingredients, which cannot be directly assisted by an LLM. The LLM cannot physically mix ingredients or interact with physical objects, so it cannot directly reduce the time it takes to complete this task.

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** While an LLM can provide recipes or instructions for mixing pancake or waffle batters, it cannot physically mix the ingredients. The task itself is hands-on and requires manual labor, which the LLM cannot perform.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** It is challenging to imagine additional software that could be developed on top of the LLM to significantly reduce the time it takes to mix ingredients physically. The task is straightforward and does not involve complex decision-making or specialized knowledge that would benefit from LLM-powered applications.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Image capabilities would not significantly impact the task of mixing ingredients, as it is a manual process that does not rely on visual information beyond reading recipes or instructions.
