1: In this task, a Sports Medicine Physician is required to provide assistance to coaches and therapists in selecting and fitting protective equipment for athletes. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves providing guidance and recommendations based on knowledge and expertise in sports medicine.
- The task does not involve complex data analysis, specialized domain knowledge retrieval, or image processing.
- The task primarily relies on the physician's expertise in understanding the requirements of different sports and the protective equipment needed.
- While the LLM can provide general information on sports medicine and protective equipment, the task requires practical, hands-on knowledge and experience that may not be effectively replaced by the LLM alone.

Based on these considerations, the task falls under E0 as it does not significantly benefit from direct access to the LLM or additional software tools built on top of it.
