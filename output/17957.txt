1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of writing reports or academic papers as a Climate Change Policy Analyst, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM in assisting with this task. The LLM can help in writing and transforming text according to complex instructions, providing edits to existing text following specifications, and summarizing medium-length documents. In this case, the task involves writing reports or academic papers to communicate findings of climate-related studies, which aligns well with the LLM's capabilities. The LLM can assist in structuring the content, providing relevant information, and ensuring clarity in communication. Therefore, this task can be significantly expedited and improved in quality with the assistance of the LLM, making it suitable for a label of E1.
