1: In this task of checking patients' pulse, temperature, and respiration, there is no direct involvement of text input or output that can be leveraged by an LLM. The task is hands-on and requires physical interaction with patients. The LLM cannot assist in measuring these vital signs or interacting with patients in a physical manner. Therefore, there is no way for the LLM to reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality. As such, this task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM or any tools built on top of it.

2: E0
