1: In this task, the instructor is conducting classes, workshops, and demonstrations to teach various subjects, including basic English language skills, life skills, and workforce entry skills. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes for an instructor to prepare for these classes, workshops, and demonstrations. The LLM could potentially assist in creating lesson plans, generating teaching materials, providing additional resources, or even answering specific questions related to the subjects being taught. However, the task also involves practical aspects such as interacting with students, assessing their progress, and adapting teaching methods based on individual needs, which may not be directly impacted by the LLM.
