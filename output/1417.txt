1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of attending fashion shows and reviewing garment magazines and manuals to gather information about fashion trends and consumer preferences as a Fashion Designer, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it more efficiently.

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** The task involves gathering information about fashion trends and consumer preferences, which could benefit from the LLM's ability to provide up-to-date information and insights. The LLM could assist in summarizing key points from fashion shows, magazines, and manuals, saving time on manual review and analysis.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time it takes to attend fashion shows or review magazines and manuals, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to summarize lengthy documents, provide recommendations based on gathered information, or even analyze consumer preferences to make informed decisions.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** This task does not involve detailed image analysis or creation, so the image capabilities of the LLM would not significantly impact the completion of the task.
