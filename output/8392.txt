1: To determine the appropriate label for the task "Interpret test information to resolve design-related problems" for Electrical and Electronic Engineering Technologists and Technicians, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves analyzing test data and using it to troubleshoot design issues. The LLM can assist in providing information on general engineering principles, troubleshooting techniques, and potential solutions based on the input data. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM can help in providing insights, explanations, and potential solutions based on the test information provided. It can assist in analyzing the data and suggesting possible design-related problems and solutions. This direct access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to interpret the test information and resolve design-related problems.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone can provide valuable insights, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to enhance its capabilities for this specific task. For example, a specialized engineering troubleshooting tool that integrates with the LLM to provide tailored solutions based on test data could further streamline the process.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not directly relevant to interpreting test information for design-related problems in electrical and electronic engineering. This task primarily involves data analysis and problem-solving based on test data rather than visual information.
