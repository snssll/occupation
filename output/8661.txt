1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of "Keeping informed about trends in education and subject matter specialties" for Career/Technical Education Teachers, Secondary School, we need to consider how the LLM can assist in this task. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM can help by summarizing articles, reports, and research papers related to education trends and subject matter specialties. It can also generate questions for further exploration based on the information provided. Additionally, the LLM can assist in writing summaries or reports on the trends identified.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time to keep informed about trends, additional software could be developed to aggregate and summarize information from various sources, providing quick updates on education trends and subject matter specialties. This software could enhance the efficiency of staying informed.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not relevant for this task as it primarily involves staying informed about trends through text-based sources rather than images.
