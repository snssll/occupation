1: In this task, a Postal Service Mail Carrier is responsible for providing customers with change of address cards and other forms. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. Providing change of address cards and forms involves a straightforward and routine process that does not require complex decision-making or specialized knowledge beyond what is typically available in the public domain. The task primarily involves handing out physical forms to customers, which does not directly align with the capabilities of an LLM. While an LLM could potentially generate text-based instructions or information related to change of address processes, the core task of physically distributing forms is not something that an LLM can directly assist with. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not significantly benefit from LLM capabilities in terms of reducing time or improving quality.
