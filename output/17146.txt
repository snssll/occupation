1: In order to determine the appropriate label for the task of training new or temporary staff for Parking Enforcement Workers, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be impacted by the use of the OpenAI large language model (LLM).

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** The task of training new or temporary staff involves providing instructions, guidance, and possibly creating training materials. The LLM can assist in generating training materials based on general knowledge, creating manuals, or even drafting training scripts. It can also help in summarizing key points to include in the training sessions. Therefore, the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to prepare for training sessions and create training materials, leading to a label of E1.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the LLM can assist in generating training materials and providing information, there may be additional software that could be developed on top of the LLM to further enhance the training process. This software could potentially analyze the effectiveness of training methods, provide personalized training plans, or even simulate real-world scenarios for training purposes. Therefore, there is potential for additional software to be developed that could further streamline the training process, warranting a label of E2.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Image capabilities are not directly relevant to the task of training new or temporary staff for Parking Enforcement Workers. This task primarily involves written or spoken communication, instruction, and guidance, which can be effectively handled by the LLM without the need for image capabilities.
