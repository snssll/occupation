1: In this task, a Community Health Worker is required to advise clients or community groups on issues related to sanitation or hygiene, such as flossing or hand washing. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves providing advice and guidance on specific health-related topics, which can be effectively communicated through text.
- The task does not require specialized domain knowledge beyond general health and hygiene practices.
- The task does not involve complex data analysis or decision-making that would require advanced tools beyond text generation.
- The task does not involve the need for image capabilities to complete the advising on sanitation or hygiene practices.

Based on these considerations, the task can be effectively completed using the capabilities of the LLM alone, without the need for additional software or image capabilities. Therefore, the task falls under label E1 as direct access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality.
