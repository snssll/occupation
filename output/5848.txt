1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of documenting technical functions and specifications for new or proposed content management systems as a Document Management Specialist, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM can assist in completing it.

- Documenting technical functions and specifications involves writing detailed descriptions of system requirements, features, and capabilities. The LLM can assist in generating clear and concise technical documentation based on the input provided about the content management systems.

- The task does not involve interacting with visuals, physical objects, or precise measurements, making it suitable for text-based processing by the LLM.

- The LLM can help in organizing and structuring the information effectively, ensuring that all necessary details are included in the documentation.

- While the task may require some domain-specific knowledge about content management systems, the LLM can still provide valuable assistance in articulating the technical aspects in a coherent manner.

Based on these considerations, the task of documenting technical functions and specifications for new or proposed content management systems as a Document Management Specialist would fall under label E1 - Direct exposure.
