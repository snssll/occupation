1: In this task, the cashier's main responsibility is to cash checks for customers. This task involves a straightforward process where the cashier verifies the customer's identity, ensures the check is valid, and then dispenses the cash. The task does not require complex decision-making or specialized knowledge beyond basic banking procedures. 

Considering the exposure rubric provided:
- E1: Direct access to the LLM could potentially reduce the time it takes to complete this task by providing standard responses or guidelines for cashing checks, but the task itself is quite simple and may not benefit significantly from the LLM's capabilities.
- E2: While additional software could potentially be developed to streamline the process of cashing checks by integrating with banking systems or providing automated verification, the task itself does not inherently require advanced LLM capabilities beyond basic text processing.
- E3: Image capabilities are not relevant for this task as it primarily involves text-based interactions with customers and checks.

Based on the analysis, the task of cashing checks for customers aligns most closely with E0 as it does not significantly benefit from the LLM's capabilities in a way that would reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete the task.
