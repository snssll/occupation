1: In this task, the Surgical Assistant is responsible for passing instruments or supplies to the surgeon during a procedure. This task involves a clear set of instructions and actions that can be easily communicated through text. The LLM can assist in providing detailed instructions on how to pass instruments correctly, what instruments are needed for specific procedures, and any other relevant information related to the task. The LLM can also generate training materials on instrument passing techniques and safety protocols. However, since this task involves physical actions and real-time coordination during a surgical procedure, it cannot be fully automated or completed solely through text-based instructions. Therefore, the LLM can provide some support and guidance but cannot replace the physical presence and actions required for this task.
