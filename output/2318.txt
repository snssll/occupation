1: In this task for Accountants and Auditors, the main activities involve collecting and analyzing data to detect various issues such as deficient controls, duplicated effort, fraud, and non-compliance with laws and regulations. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could assist in completing it. 

- E0: This task involves a high level of human judgment and interpretation of complex financial data, legal requirements, and management policies. The task also requires a deep understanding of accounting principles and auditing standards. While the LLM can provide information and insights, it cannot replace the expertise and experience required to perform the analysis accurately.

- E1: The LLM could potentially assist in providing general information on laws, regulations, and management policies related to auditing. It could also help in summarizing data or generating initial insights based on the information provided. However, the task of analyzing data to detect specific issues like fraud or non-compliance involves specialized knowledge and expertise that the LLM alone may not possess.

- E2: With additional software development, the LLM could be integrated with data analysis tools to automate certain aspects of data collection and analysis. This could include summarizing large datasets, identifying patterns or anomalies, and generating preliminary reports. The combination of LLM capabilities with data analysis tools could streamline the initial stages of the auditing process.

- E3: Given the task's focus on data analysis, having access to image capabilities would not significantly impact the completion of this task. The task primarily involves textual data related to financial records, regulations, and policies, which can be effectively processed by the LLM without the need for image capabilities.
