1: In this task, a substitute teacher is required to counsel students with adjustment or academic problems. To complete this task, the substitute teacher needs to provide guidance, support, and advice to students who may be facing challenges in their academic performance or struggling with personal issues affecting their adjustment in the school environment. The task involves active listening, empathy, problem-solving skills, and the ability to provide appropriate advice and support to students in need.

Considering the task requirements, the LLM could potentially assist by providing general advice or counseling scripts that the substitute teacher can use as a reference. The LLM could generate responses to common student issues or provide suggestions on how to approach certain situations. However, the task of counseling students often requires a high level of human interaction, empathy, and understanding, which may not be effectively replicated by the LLM. The LLM may not have the ability to fully understand the emotional nuances of each student's situation or provide personalized guidance tailored to individual needs.
