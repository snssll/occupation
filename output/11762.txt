1: In this task, a graphic designer is required to photograph layouts using a camera to create layout prints for supervisors or clients. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The LLM can assist with tasks related to text input and output, but it does not have the ability to interact with physical objects like a camera. Since this task involves physical actions such as using a camera to capture images, it falls under the category of tasks that cannot be directly assisted by the LLM. Therefore, this task would be classified as E0 as it does not fall within the capabilities of the LLM.

2: E0

3: High
