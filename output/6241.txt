1: Wind Energy Operations Managers are responsible for overseeing the operations of wind farms, ensuring efficiency, safety, and compliance with regulations. One of the tasks they perform is establishing goals, objectives, or priorities for wind field operations. To determine the appropriate label for this task's exposure to LLM, we need to consider the complexity and specificity of the task. 

- If the task involves accessing general information about wind energy operations, setting goals, and priorities based on standard industry practices, the LLM could provide relevant information and suggestions to assist in this task. This would fall under E1 as the LLM can help in writing and transforming text according to complex instructions related to wind energy operations.

- If the task requires highly specialized knowledge about wind energy operations, such as detailed technical specifications or industry trends, the LLM alone may not have the depth of specialized knowledge required. However, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to provide recommendations based on specific data and industry insights. This falls under E2 as specialized domain knowledge may be needed beyond what the LLM can provide.

- If the task involves analyzing complex data sets, market trends, and performance metrics to establish goals and priorities, the LLM alone may not be sufficient. However, with image capabilities to visualize data or trends, the task could be significantly expedited. This falls under E3 as image capabilities could enhance the analysis process.
