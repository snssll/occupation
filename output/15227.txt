1: In this task, a Roof Bolter in mining is responsible for rotating chucks to turn bolts and open expansion heads against rock formations. This task involves physical work in a mining environment, requiring manual labor and specialized equipment. The task does not involve text input or output, and the context cannot be captured within 2000 words for an LLM to provide assistance. Additionally, the task requires hands-on manipulation of equipment and interaction with physical rock formations, which cannot be simulated or assisted by an LLM. Therefore, this task does not fall within the capabilities of an LLM or any tools built on top of it.
