1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of performing user testing or usage analyses as a Web Administrator, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be supported by the capabilities of the LLM.

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** The task involves analyzing user testing data and usability of websites, which can benefit from the LLM's ability to process and generate text-based information. The LLM can assist in summarizing user feedback, generating reports, and providing insights based on the data collected. This direct text-based analysis and reporting can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the LLM can assist in analyzing text-based data, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to enhance the analysis further. For example, specialized tools could be created to automate certain aspects of user testing analysis, provide recommendations based on data, or even generate visualizations of the usability data. These additional capabilities could further streamline the process but may not be directly available through the LLM alone.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** The task of performing user testing or usage analyses does not inherently require image capabilities. The analysis is primarily focused on text-based data such as user feedback, website metrics, and usability reports. Therefore, the use of image capabilities for this task is not essential.
