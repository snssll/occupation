1: In this task, a Laundry and Dry-Cleaning Worker is required to mix bleaching agents with hot water in vats and soak material until it is bleached. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. This task involves physical actions such as mixing chemicals and soaking materials, which cannot be directly performed by an LLM. The task also requires hands-on work with specific equipment, which is not within the capabilities of the LLM. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not involve text-based activities that can be significantly aided by the LLM.
