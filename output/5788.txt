1: In this task, a teaching assistant is responsible for distributing tests and homework assignments to students and collecting them once completed. With the help of a large language model (LLM), the assistant could potentially automate the process of creating and distributing these materials. The LLM could generate test questions, homework assignments, and instructions for distribution. Additionally, the LLM could assist in organizing and tracking the completion of these assignments. Overall, the LLM could significantly streamline the administrative aspects of managing tests and homework in a school setting.

Considering the capabilities of the LLM to generate text, provide instructions, and assist in organizing data, this task falls under E1 exposure. The LLM can efficiently handle the text-based aspects of creating, distributing, and collecting assignments, reducing the time and effort required from the teaching assistant.
