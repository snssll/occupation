1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of providing guests with menus as a Host or Hostess in a restaurant, lounge, or coffee shop, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. In this task, the main action involves handing out menus to guests, which is a physical interaction and does not involve text-based input or output that the LLM can directly assist with. The task does not require complex text transformation, writing, summarization, or any other form of text-based interaction that the LLM excels at. Therefore, the task does not fall under E1, E2, or E3 categories as it does not involve text-based tasks that the LLM can significantly assist with.
