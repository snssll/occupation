1: Histology technicians are responsible for preparing tissue samples for examination under a microscope. One of the tasks they perform is mounting tissue specimens on glass slides. To determine the appropriate label for this task's exposure to LLM, we need to consider whether the task can be significantly expedited or improved by using the language model. In this case, the task involves a physical action of mounting tissue specimens on glass slides, which cannot be directly assisted by an LLM. While the LLM could potentially provide information on histology techniques or procedures, it cannot physically mount the specimens. Therefore, the task does not fall under E1, E2, or E3 categories.

2: E0
