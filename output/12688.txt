1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of preparing project proposals as a Natural Sciences Manager, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM can assist in completing it. 

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** The task of preparing project proposals involves writing detailed plans, budgets, timelines, and justifications for scientific projects. The LLM can assist by providing templates, generating content for specific sections, offering suggestions for improvement, and ensuring the proposal is well-structured and coherent. The LLM can also help with researching background information and incorporating relevant data into the proposal. Overall, the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to create a high-quality project proposal by providing guidance and generating content.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the LLM alone can be very helpful in generating content and structuring the proposal, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to further streamline the process. This software could include features like summarizing relevant research papers, analyzing data to support the proposal, and integrating up-to-date information from scientific databases. Such tools could enhance the efficiency and accuracy of preparing project proposals beyond what the LLM can achieve on its own.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Image capabilities are not directly relevant to the task of preparing project proposals in the field of Natural Sciences Management. This task primarily involves text-based work such as writing, editing, and organizing information for the proposal. Image capabilities would not significantly impact the completion of this task.

Based on the above analysis, the most fitting label for the task of preparing project proposals as a Natural Sciences Manager is **E1 (Direct exposure)**.
