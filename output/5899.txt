1: In this task, an Architectural and Civil Drafter is required to draw rough and detailed scale plans for foundations, buildings, and structures based on various inputs such as preliminary concepts, sketches, engineering calculations, specification sheets, and other data. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The LLM can assist in generating text based on inputs, providing information, and potentially aiding in calculations. However, the task of drawing scale plans involves visual and spatial elements that go beyond text generation. While the LLM can help with some aspects like providing information on building materials or construction techniques, it cannot directly create visual drawings or handle the spatial aspects of architectural drafting.
