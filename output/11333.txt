1: For the task of performing administrative duties as a Kindergarten Teacher, such as assisting in school libraries, hall and cafeteria monitoring, and bus loading and unloading, we need to consider if access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with high quality. In this case, the task involves physical activities like monitoring and loading/unloading buses, which cannot be directly assisted by the LLM. While the LLM could potentially help with administrative tasks like organizing schedules or preparing reports, the physical aspects of the task cannot be automated by the LLM. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not meet the criteria for exposure to LLM capabilities.
