1: In this task, a Nursing Assistant or Orderly is responsible for cleaning and sanitizing patient rooms, bathrooms, examination rooms, or other patient areas. To determine the appropriate exposure label for this task in relation to the LLM, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves straightforward instructions that can be easily understood and executed by a human worker.
- The task does not require complex decision-making or specialized domain knowledge beyond basic healthcare hygiene practices.
- The task does not involve the need for up-to-date information or extensive research beyond standard cleaning and sanitization protocols.
- The task does not involve the use of images, text from PDFs, or any other specialized capabilities that would significantly benefit from LLM-powered applications.

Based on these considerations, it is evident that the task of cleaning and sanitizing patient areas does not require the use of LLM or any advanced software tools to complete efficiently. A human worker with basic training and experience in healthcare hygiene practices can effectively carry out this task without the need for LLM assistance.
