1: In this task, a First-Line Supervisor of Firefighting and Prevention Workers is required to directly investigate cases of suspected arson, hazards, and false alarms and submit reports outlining their findings. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- Directly investigating cases involves gathering information, analyzing evidence, and documenting findings. The LLM can assist in providing guidance on investigative techniques, legal requirements, and potential red flags to look for during investigations.
- Writing reports outlining findings can be supported by the LLM in structuring the report, ensuring clarity, and providing relevant information to include.

Given that the task involves a significant amount of human judgment, interaction, and on-the-ground investigation, it is unlikely that the LLM alone can reduce the time it takes to complete the task by at least half. While the LLM can provide some support in terms of structuring reports and providing general guidance, the core investigative work and decision-making process are human-centric and require specialized knowledge and experience.
