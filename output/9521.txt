1: In this task, the occupation of riggers involves manipulating rigging lines, hoists, and pulling gear to move or support materials like heavy equipment, ships, or theatrical sets. To determine the exposure label for this task, we need to consider if access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete the task with high quality by at least half.

- The task of manipulating rigging lines, hoists, and pulling gear requires physical interaction and expertise in handling equipment safely and effectively. This task involves practical skills, spatial awareness, and physical strength, which cannot be replicated by the LLM.
- While the LLM can provide information on rigging techniques, safety guidelines, or theoretical knowledge related to rigging, it cannot replace the hands-on experience and physical execution required in this task.
- The task does not involve extensive written or spoken communication that could be significantly enhanced by the LLM. The core of the task lies in the physical manipulation of equipment and materials.

Based on these considerations, it is evident that the task of manipulating rigging lines, hoists, and pulling gear falls under the E0 category as it does not meet the criteria for exposure to LLM assistance in reducing the time it takes to complete the task significantly.
