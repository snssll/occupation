1: In this task, the Cutting, Punching, and Press Machine Setters, Operators, and Tenders, Metal and Plastic need to measure completed workpieces to ensure they meet specifications. This task involves using tools like micrometers, gauges, calipers, templates, or rulers to verify conformance. The task does not involve text input or output, and it requires physical interaction with the workpieces and tools. Since the task involves precise measurements and physical manipulation, it cannot be effectively completed using an LLM or any software built on top of it. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not benefit from LLM exposure.

2: E0
