1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of conducting question-and-answer presentations on astronomy topics with public audiences as an astronomer, we need to consider the level of exposure to LLM. 

- E0: This task involves direct human interaction with public audiences, which cannot be replaced by LLM or any tool built on top of it. The nuances of engaging with the audience, understanding their questions, and providing tailored responses require human expertise and adaptability. Therefore, this task does not benefit from LLM exposure.

- E1: While the LLM could potentially assist in preparing materials for the presentation, such as generating content for slides or scripts, the core aspect of conducting live question-and-answer sessions with public audiences cannot be effectively automated by the LLM. The real-time nature of interactions, the need for empathy, and the ability to gauge audience reactions are essential human skills that cannot be replicated by the LLM.

- E2: Although the LLM could be used to generate detailed information on astronomy topics for preparation before the presentation, the task of conducting question-and-answer sessions with public audiences requires human expertise in communication, public speaking, and engaging with diverse audiences. While additional software could potentially enhance the preparation process, the live interaction aspect remains a crucial human element.

- E3: The task of conducting question-and-answer presentations on astronomy topics with public audiences does not involve image-related capabilities that would significantly benefit from the LLM's image capabilities. The core of the task lies in verbal communication and engagement with the audience, which is not directly related to image processing.

Based on the above analysis, the most appropriate label for this task is E0.

2: E0

3: High
