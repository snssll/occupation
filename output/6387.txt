1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of evaluating costs and revenue of agreements to determine continued profitability for Securities, Commodities, and Financial Services Sales Agents, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves analyzing financial data, understanding agreements, and making profitability assessments based on this information.

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM can assist in analyzing financial data, calculating costs and revenue, and providing insights into the profitability of agreements. It can help in summarizing complex financial information, generating reports, and even providing recommendations based on the data provided. The task involves text input and output, which the LLM can handle effectively.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone can provide valuable insights and analysis, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to enhance its capabilities further. This software could include features like retrieving up-to-date financial data, making real-time market predictions, or providing more detailed financial analysis tools.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not relevant for this task as it primarily involves analyzing financial data and agreements, which are text-based.

Considering the task's nature of analyzing financial data and making profitability assessments, the most suitable label appears to be E1: Direct exposure.
