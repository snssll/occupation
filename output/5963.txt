1: In this task, the main responsibility is driving mobile clinic vans to farms to treat or prevent health problems in animals. This task involves physical actions such as driving, interacting with animals, and potentially administering treatments. The task does not involve text input or output, and the context is primarily based on physical location and animal health, which may not be effectively captured within the 2000-word limit for the LLM. The LLM does not have the capability to physically drive vans or administer treatments, making it unsuitable for directly completing this task. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM or any tools built on top of it.

2: E0
