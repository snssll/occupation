1: In this task, the Hearing Aid Specialist is responsible for training clients on how to use hearing aids or other communication devices. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. Training clients involves a significant amount of human interaction and hands-on demonstration. The process may require personalized adjustments based on individual needs and preferences, which may not be effectively conveyed through text alone. Additionally, the physical aspect of fitting and adjusting hearing aids cannot be replicated by an LLM. While the LLM could potentially provide written materials or general information on hearing aids, the hands-on training aspect of this task is crucial and cannot be fully automated by the LLM.
