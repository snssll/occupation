1: In this task, the occupation of Skincare Specialists involves selecting and applying cosmetic products like creams, lotions, and tonics. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes for a skincare specialist to complete this task with high quality. 

- E0: This task involves physical interaction and application of products, which cannot be replaced by the LLM. The LLM cannot physically select and apply cosmetic products.
- E1: While the LLM can provide information on skincare products, such as their ingredients, benefits, and potential side effects, it cannot physically select and apply the products. Therefore, the direct access to the LLM does not reduce the time it takes to complete this task significantly.
- E2: It is conceivable that software could be developed on top of the LLM that could provide recommendations for skincare products based on specific skin types, concerns, and preferences. This software could potentially streamline the product selection process for skincare specialists, but it would not directly apply the products.
- E3: The LLM, combined with image capabilities, could potentially assist in creating digital images or guides for skincare specialists on how to apply products correctly. However, this would not involve the physical application of products.
