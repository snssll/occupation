1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of writing decisions on cases for Judges, Magistrate Judges, and Magistrates, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The task involves writing text based on information and legal analysis, which aligns with the LLM's ability to generate text based on input. The LLM can assist in drafting decisions by providing legal language, precedent references, and analysis based on the case details provided. This can significantly reduce the time it takes to draft decisions compared to manual writing.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone can assist in drafting decisions, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to enhance its capabilities further. For example, specialized legal databases could be integrated with the LLM to provide more specific legal references and analysis tailored to the case at hand.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not relevant for the task of writing decisions on cases, as it primarily involves text-based work and legal analysis.

Based on the above analysis, the task of writing decisions on cases for Judges, Magistrate Judges, and Magistrates is best classified as E1: Direct exposure.
