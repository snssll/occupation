1: For the task of preparing and delivering lectures as a History Teacher, Postsecondary, the exposure to LLM can be evaluated as follows:

- E1: Direct access to the LLM could significantly reduce the time it takes to prepare lectures by providing assistance in researching and organizing information, generating content, and even helping with structuring the lecture materials. The LLM could assist in summarizing key points, providing historical context, and suggesting engaging ways to present the information.

- E2: While the LLM alone may not reduce the time by half for this task, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to create tools for organizing lecture materials, generating interactive content, or even creating multimedia presentations. These tools could enhance the efficiency of lecture preparation and delivery.

- E3: Image capabilities would not have a significant impact on preparing and delivering lectures in this context, as the task primarily involves text-based content creation and presentation. The LLM's text capabilities are more relevant for this task.

Based on the above analysis, the task of preparing and delivering lectures as a History Teacher, Postsecondary, aligns best with **E2 - Exposure by LLM-powered applications**.
