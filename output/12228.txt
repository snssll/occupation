1: In this task, a surgical assistant is required to postoperatively inject a subcutaneous local anesthetic agent to reduce pain. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves a hands-on, physical procedure that requires precise measurements and human interaction. It is a practical, technical task that cannot be completed solely through text-based instructions or information. The task also involves direct patient care, which necessitates human judgment and decision-making based on real-time observations and patient responses. As such, the task falls under the category of E0 as it requires a high degree of human interaction, precise measurements, and physical actions that cannot be replaced by an LLM or any software tool.
