1: In this task, an Automotive Glass Installer and Repairer is required to hold cut or uneven edges of glass against automated abrasive belts to shape or smooth edges. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. This task involves physical interaction with glass and machinery, which cannot be directly assisted by an LLM. The task requires manual dexterity, precision, and physical coordination, which are not within the capabilities of the LLM. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not involve text input or output that can be processed by the LLM to significantly reduce the time needed to complete the task.
