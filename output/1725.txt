1: In this task of caring for artificial turf fields, the main activities involve periodically removing the turf and replacing cushioning pads, as well as vacuuming and disinfecting the turf to prevent the growth of harmful bacteria. These tasks are physical in nature and require hands-on work with the turf and equipment. The task does not involve text input or output, complex instructions, data analysis, or decision-making that can be effectively handled by an LLM. As such, there is no direct exposure to LLM capabilities that can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality. Additionally, developing software on top of the LLM to handle physical tasks like caring for artificial turf fields is not feasible. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not benefit from LLM capabilities.
