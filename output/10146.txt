1: In this task, the occupation involves monitoring the progress of drilling operations and selecting and changing drill bits based on the nature of the strata using hand tools. To complete this task, the worker needs to have knowledge of drilling operations, understanding of different types of strata, and the ability to use hand tools effectively. The task does not involve complex text input or output, and the information required is more practical and hands-on.
