1: In this task, the roustabouts in the oil and gas industry are responsible for guiding cranes to move loads about decks. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality. 

- E0: This task involves physical interaction and precise movements to guide cranes, which cannot be performed by the LLM or any software tool. Therefore, it falls under E0 as the LLM cannot assist in completing this task.
