1: In this task, a Machine Feeder and Offbearer is responsible for opening and closing gates of belt and pneumatic conveyors on machines that are fed directly from preceding machines. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be automated or assisted by text-based instructions or information retrieval. Since this task involves physical actions such as opening and closing gates, it does not involve text-based instructions, information retrieval, or any form of writing or communication that could be significantly aided by an LLM. Therefore, this task does not align with any of the exposure levels in the rubric.

2: E0
