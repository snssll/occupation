1: In this task, an Automotive Engineer is required to design control systems or algorithms for various purposes related to automotive energy management, emissions management, or operational safety and performance. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the complexity and specificity of the task. 

- E0: This task involves highly specialized domain knowledge in automotive engineering, requiring expertise in control systems and algorithms specific to the automotive industry. The task does not involve text-based inputs or outputs that can be easily processed by an LLM. The LLM alone cannot reduce the time significantly for an experienced Automotive Engineer to design these systems.

- E1: While an LLM could potentially assist in providing general information or explanations related to automotive engineering concepts, it cannot directly design control systems or algorithms for automotive purposes. The task is highly technical and requires specialized knowledge beyond what an LLM can provide.

- E2: It is conceivable that additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to assist Automotive Engineers in designing control systems or algorithms by providing recommendations based on data or written input. This software could potentially analyze information to inform decisions or make recommendations, but the task itself is still highly specialized and may not be significantly expedited by the LLM alone.

- E3: The task does not involve image capabilities or require reading text from PDFs or creating/editing digital images. Therefore, exposure to image capabilities would not significantly impact the time it takes to complete this task.
