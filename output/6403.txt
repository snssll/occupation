1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of evaluating employee performance as a First-Line Supervisor of Production and Operating Workers, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves assessing and providing feedback on employee performance, which is primarily a qualitative and subjective process that requires human judgment and understanding of the specific work environment and employee roles.

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM could potentially assist in generating templates or guidelines for evaluating employee performance based on general principles. It could also help in drafting feedback or performance reviews. However, the nuanced understanding of individual employee roles, performance metrics, and the specific context of the workplace would likely require human input. Therefore, while the LLM could aid in some aspects, it cannot fully replace the need for human judgment in this task.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While there could be software developed on top of the LLM that provides performance evaluation frameworks or templates, the task of evaluating employee performance goes beyond just following a template. It involves understanding the unique dynamics of the workplace, individual employee strengths and weaknesses, and providing tailored feedback. The LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task by half.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities would not significantly impact the task of evaluating employee performance, as it is primarily text-based and requires understanding of qualitative aspects of performance rather than visual information.
