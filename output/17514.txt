1: In this task, the self-enrichment teacher or educator is required to use computers, audio-visual aids, and other equipment to supplement presentations. With access to the powerful OpenAI large language model (LLM), the teacher could potentially receive assistance in generating content for presentations, creating engaging materials, or even getting ideas for interactive activities to supplement their presentations. The LLM could help in providing creative ideas, suggesting relevant audio-visual aids, or even assisting in writing scripts for presentations. Overall, the LLM could significantly reduce the time it takes for the teacher to prepare and enhance their presentations, making the task more efficient and effective.
