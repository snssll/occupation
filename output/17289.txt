1: In this task, the main responsibility is to transport patients to and from the occupational therapy work area. This task involves physical interaction with patients, ensuring their safety during transportation, and potentially providing assistance to patients with mobility issues. Since this task requires physical movement and direct interaction with individuals, it does not involve text-based or data-driven activities that could benefit significantly from the capabilities of an LLM. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM or any tools built on top of it.
