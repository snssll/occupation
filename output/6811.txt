1: In this task, the Family Medicine Physicians, Cardiologists, Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and General Internal Medicine Physicians need to explain procedures, discuss test results, or prescribed treatments with patients. To complete this task, the physician must have a good understanding of medical procedures, test results, and treatments, as well as the ability to communicate effectively with patients. The LLM can assist in providing general information about medical procedures, test results, and treatments, but it cannot provide specific patient information or personalized advice without the risk of violating patient privacy laws. The LLM can generate sample explanations or discussions that the physician can use as a reference, but the final communication with the patient must be done by the physician. Therefore, the LLM can only provide general support in terms of information and sample dialogues, but the actual communication with the patient requires the expertise and judgment of the physician.
