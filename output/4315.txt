1: In this task, a Blockchain Engineer is required to design and verify cryptographic protocols to protect private information. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we can break down the task:
- Designing cryptographic protocols involves creating complex algorithms and structures to secure data within a blockchain system.
- Verifying cryptographic protocols requires testing and ensuring the effectiveness and security of the designed protocols.

Given the complexity and technical nature of this task, it falls under the category of highly specialized domain knowledge. The task involves a deep understanding of cryptography, blockchain technology, and data security. While the LLM can provide general information on these topics, it may not have the specific expertise required to design and verify cryptographic protocols effectively.
