1: In this task, a helper carpenter is required to perform tie spacing layout and measure, mark, drill, or cut. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves physical actions such as measuring, marking, drilling, and cutting, which cannot be directly performed by an LLM. While the LLM could potentially provide guidance on the spacing layout or offer theoretical knowledge on carpentry techniques, it cannot physically execute the task. Therefore, the task does not fall under E1, as it cannot be directly completed by the LLM alone. Additionally, developing software on top of the LLM to perform physical carpentry tasks is not feasible, as it involves real-world actions that go beyond text-based instructions or recommendations. As a result, the task does not align with E2 either. Since the task requires physical actions that cannot be substituted by the LLM or any software built on top of it, it does not fit within the scope of E3, which involves image capabilities. Therefore, the most appropriate label for this task is E0.

2: E0

3: High
