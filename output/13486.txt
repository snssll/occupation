1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of providing system design and integration recommendations as a Security Management Specialist, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be aided by the use of a large language model (LLM).

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** If the task involves writing detailed system design and integration recommendations based on specific criteria and requirements, the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to generate these recommendations. The LLM can assist in drafting comprehensive reports, analyzing different integration options, and providing detailed design suggestions based on the input data. This direct access to the LLM can streamline the process and improve efficiency.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the LLM alone can help generate text-based recommendations, additional software built on top of the LLM could further enhance the process. For example, specialized software could be developed to analyze existing system data, recommend specific integration strategies based on real-time security threats, or provide insights from a vast database of security protocols. Such software could leverage the LLM's capabilities to offer more tailored and advanced recommendations.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Since the task of providing system design and integration recommendations primarily involves text-based inputs and outputs, image capabilities are not directly relevant in this context. Therefore, the use of image capabilities would not significantly impact the completion time or quality of the task.
