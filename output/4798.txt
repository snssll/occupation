1: In this task, a Child, Family, and School Social Worker is required to develop and review service plans in consultation with clients and perform follow-ups assessing the quantity and quality of services provided. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be significantly expedited or improved by using the LLM. 

- The task involves developing and reviewing service plans, which may require understanding the specific needs of clients, legal requirements, and best practices in social work. The LLM can provide general information on social work practices, legal guidelines, and examples of service plans, which could assist in the development and review process.
- The task also involves assessing the quantity and quality of services provided, which may involve analyzing data, client feedback, and making recommendations for improvements. The LLM can help in analyzing data, generating reports, and providing recommendations based on the information provided.
- While the LLM can provide general information and support in the tasks involved, the specific nature of client consultations, understanding individual cases, and the nuanced aspects of social work may require human judgment and expertise that the LLM may not fully capture.

Based on these considerations, the task could be classified as E2 - Exposure by LLM-powered applications. While the LLM can assist in providing information and support for the task, additional software tailored to the specific needs of social work and client interactions could further enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of completing the task.
