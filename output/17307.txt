1: In this task, the Electrical Power-Line Installers and Repairers are required to travel in trucks, helicopters, and airplanes to inspect power lines for obstructions and insulation adequacy. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves physical travel to various locations to visually inspect power lines, which cannot be directly assisted by an LLM. The task also requires hands-on inspection and assessment of the power lines, which is not something an LLM can perform. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not involve text-based work that can be significantly aided by an LLM.
