1: In this task, a Web Administrator is responsible for setting up or maintaining monitoring tools on Web servers or websites. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

Setting up or maintaining monitoring tools on Web servers or websites involves technical knowledge related to server management, monitoring tools, and website performance. While an LLM could potentially provide general information or guidelines on setting up monitoring tools, the task itself requires hands-on technical expertise and implementation that goes beyond the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves interacting with server configurations, software installations, and troubleshooting, which are not within the current capabilities of the LLM.
