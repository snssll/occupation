1: In this task, a graphic designer is required to prepare illustrations or rough sketches of material, discuss them with clients or supervisors, and make necessary changes based on feedback. With the help of the LLM, the designer could potentially generate initial ideas for illustrations or sketches based on input provided. The LLM could assist in brainstorming concepts, suggesting design elements, or even providing descriptions of visual ideas. However, the LLM may not be able to fully replace the creative and artistic skills required in graphic design, especially when it comes to the visual execution and refinement of the illustrations or sketches. Therefore, while the LLM can aid in the ideation process, the actual creation and refinement of visual content may still heavily rely on the designer's expertise and artistic abilities.
