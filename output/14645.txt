1: In this task, a Sound Engineering Technician is responsible for reporting equipment problems and ensuring that necessary repairs are carried out. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we can break down the task:
- The task involves primarily written communication, as the technician needs to report equipment problems. This can be done effectively using the LLM to draft detailed reports.
- The LLM can assist in generating repair requests with specific details, ensuring clarity and accuracy in communication.
- While the LLM can aid in documenting the issues, it may not significantly reduce the time required for the technician to physically ensure repairs are made, as this may involve hands-on work or coordination with maintenance staff.
