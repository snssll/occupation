1: For the task of washing, cutting, and preparing foods designated for cooking as a Fast Food Cook, we need to determine the exposure level to LLM. 

- This task involves physical actions such as washing, cutting, and preparing food, which cannot be directly performed by an LLM.
- The task does not involve complex decision-making, specialized domain knowledge, or detailed data analysis that would require an LLM.
- The task is straightforward and does not involve text input or output that would benefit significantly from LLM capabilities.

Based on these considerations, it is clear that this task falls under E0 as it does not align with any of the exposure levels described in the rubric.

2: E0

3: High
