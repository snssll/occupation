1: In this task, a Floral Designer is required to select flora and foliage for arrangements, working with numerous combinations to synthesize and develop new creations. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves creativity, artistic skills, and a deep understanding of different types of flowers and foliage. While an LLM could potentially provide some general information about flora and foliage, it may not have the specialized knowledge and creativity required to synthesize new floral arrangements. The task also involves a hands-on component of physically selecting and arranging the flowers, which cannot be done by the LLM. Therefore, the task does not seem to benefit significantly from the capabilities of the LLM, and it falls under E0.
