1: In this task of cleaning and lubricating parts and subassemblies, the main activities involve physical actions such as applying grease or oil. These actions cannot be directly performed by an LLM or any software tool. While the task may involve some written instructions or documentation related to the specific parts being cleaned and lubricated, the core of the task is manual and does not involve text-based activities that an LLM could significantly assist with. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM or any tools built on top of it.
