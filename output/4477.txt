1: Biostatisticians design surveys to assess health issues. This task involves creating structured questionnaires to collect data on various health topics. To determine the appropriate exposure label for this task in relation to the LLM, we can break it down as follows:

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** The LLM can assist in drafting survey questions by providing suggestions for wording, question order, and potential response options based on existing survey design principles and best practices. It can also help in refining the survey based on feedback and analyzing the wording for clarity and bias. The LLM's text generation capabilities can significantly reduce the time needed to create survey instruments with equivalent quality.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the LLM alone can aid in survey design, additional software could be developed to automate parts of the survey creation process, such as generating multiple versions of a survey for A/B testing, incorporating advanced statistical considerations into the survey design, or integrating real-time data analysis to optimize survey questions based on ongoing responses. Such software could further streamline the survey design process beyond what the LLM can achieve on its own.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Image capabilities are not relevant for designing surveys to assess health issues, as this task primarily involves text-based work and does not require image processing.

Based on the above analysis, the most fitting label for the task of designing surveys to assess health issues in relation to the LLM is **E1 (Direct exposure)**.
