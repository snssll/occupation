1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of selecting and purchasing technical web services as an Online Merchant, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves researching and making decisions based on specific technical requirements for web services. The LLM can assist in providing information on different types of web services, explaining their features, and potentially even comparing them based on certain criteria. However, the LLM may not have real-time information on the latest offerings or pricing of these services, as it cannot access up-to-date facts unless provided in the input. Additionally, the task may require interacting with specific websites, comparing reviews, and considering factors like customer support, which the LLM may not be able to do effectively.

Considering these factors, the task of selecting and purchasing technical web services as an Online Merchant falls under E2 - Exposure by LLM-powered applications. While the LLM can provide information and potentially assist in decision-making, additional software that can access real-time data, compare prices, and analyze customer reviews would significantly enhance the efficiency of completing this task.
