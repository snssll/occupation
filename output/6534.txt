1: In this task, a Transportation Engineer is required to evaluate traffic control devices or lighting systems to determine if modifications or expansions are needed. To complete this task, the engineer would need to analyze data related to traffic flow, safety, and efficiency of the current systems. The engineer may also need to consider factors such as population growth, urban development, and technological advancements that could impact the effectiveness of the existing systems. 

Considering the task description, the most relevant exposure label from the rubric would be E0. This task involves a high level of expertise in transportation engineering, data analysis, and decision-making based on various complex factors. While an LLM could potentially assist in providing general information on traffic control devices or lighting systems, the task itself requires specialized knowledge and expertise that cannot be fully replaced by the LLM. Additionally, the task involves making critical decisions that impact public safety and infrastructure, which should be handled by a human expert in the field.
