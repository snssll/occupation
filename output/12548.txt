1: In this task, an Instructional Coordinator is responsible for preparing grant proposals, budgets, program policies, and goals, or assisting in their preparation. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves writing and transforming text (grant proposals, policies, goals) according to complex instructions.
- The task may require providing edits to existing text following specifications.
- It involves maintaining records of written data (grant proposals, budgets, policies).
- The task may involve preparing training materials based on general knowledge (related to program goals and policies).

Given that the task primarily revolves around writing, editing, and preparing written materials, the most suitable label from the exposure rubric would be E1. The LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task by assisting in generating, editing, and refining the written content required for grant proposals, budgets, policies, and goals.
