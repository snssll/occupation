1: In this task, a Foundry Mold and Coremaker is responsible for cutting spouts, runner holes, and sprue holes into molds. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. Cutting these holes into molds involves physical work and precise measurements, which cannot be directly performed by an LLM. The task requires manual dexterity, knowledge of materials, and the ability to work with machinery. Since this task involves physical actions and precise measurements, it falls under the category of tasks that cannot be significantly aided by an LLM or LLM-powered tool. Therefore, this task would be classified as E0.

2: E0
