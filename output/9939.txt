1: In this task, a teller is responsible for monitoring bank vaults to ensure cash balances are correct. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we can break down the task:
- The task involves monitoring bank vaults, which may require checking physical cash and comparing it to records.
- The task does not involve complex decision-making or specialized domain knowledge beyond basic banking procedures.
- The task is primarily focused on verifying cash balances, which can be a straightforward process for a teller.

Based on the nature of the task and the simplicity of the actions required, it is unlikely that access to an LLM would significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task. The task does not involve complex text input or output, and the information needed is more practical and hands-on. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as the use of an LLM would not substantially decrease the time needed for an experienced worker to complete it.
