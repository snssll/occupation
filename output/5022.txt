1: In this task, a fundraiser is responsible for developing or implementing fundraising activities, such as annual giving campaigns or direct mail programs. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider whether access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality.

Fundraising activities involve a lot of creativity, strategy, and human interaction. While the LLM can assist in generating written content, providing ideas, or even drafting fundraising materials, the core of fundraising involves building relationships, understanding donor motivations, and tailoring campaigns to specific audiences. The LLM may not have the nuanced understanding of human emotions, social dynamics, and individual motivations required for successful fundraising efforts.

Given the nature of this task and the importance of human interaction and emotional intelligence in fundraising, it is unlikely that the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality. Therefore, this task is best classified as E0.

2: E0

3: High
