1: In this task, a Radiologic Technologist or Technician is responsible for making exposures necessary for requested procedures, ensuring that the images meet established standards. To determine the appropriate exposure settings, the technologist needs to consider factors such as the patient's size, the body part being imaged, and the type of procedure. They must also be able to recognize when an image does not meet quality standards and be able to adjust the exposure settings accordingly. While an LLM could potentially provide general information on exposure settings and standards, it cannot physically operate the imaging equipment or assess the quality of the images produced. Therefore, this task involves hands-on technical skills and judgment that cannot be directly replaced by an LLM.
