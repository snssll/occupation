1: In this task, a recreation worker is required to enforce rules and regulations at recreational facilities to maintain discipline and ensure safety. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. Enforcing rules and regulations involves understanding and applying specific guidelines, communicating effectively with patrons, and ensuring compliance. While the task involves some level of decision-making and human interaction, it primarily revolves around following established protocols and maintaining order.

Given that the task does not involve complex data analysis, specialized domain knowledge, or detailed image processing, it is unlikely that access to the LLM alone would significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task. The task is more focused on practical enforcement and interpersonal skills rather than information processing or analysis that could be enhanced by the LLM. Therefore, the task is best classified as E0, as the LLM would not provide a substantial advantage in completing this particular task.

2: E0

3: Moderate
