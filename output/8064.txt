1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of installing and configuring wireless networking equipment as a Computer Network Support Specialist, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be impacted by the use of the LLM.

- **E0**: This task involves physical installation and configuration of equipment, which requires hands-on work and technical expertise. The LLM cannot physically interact with hardware or perform tasks that require physical presence, so it is unlikely to significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task.

- **E1**: While the LLM can provide information on wireless networking equipment, such as specifications, troubleshooting tips, or general guidance on installation and configuration, it cannot physically perform the installation or configuration. Therefore, the direct use of the LLM alone would not reduce the time it takes to complete this task by at least half.

- **E2**: It is conceivable that additional software could be developed on top of the LLM that could assist in this task. For example, a virtual simulation tool that guides users through the installation process step by step based on LLM-generated instructions could potentially reduce the time needed to complete the task. However, as of now, such software does not exist.

- **E3**: The task of installing and configuring wireless networking equipment does not involve image processing or analysis that would benefit from additional image capabilities beyond text-based information provided by the LLM.

Based on the above analysis, the most appropriate label for this task is **E2**.

2: E2
