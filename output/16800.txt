1: In this task, an exercise physiologist is required to teach group exercise sessions to clients of varying risk levels to improve their physical health. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone or with additional software could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task.

- E0: This task involves physical interaction and demonstration, which cannot be replaced by text-based tools like the LLM. Additionally, the task requires real-time assessment of clients' physical abilities and adjustments to the exercise program, which cannot be effectively done through text-based tools alone.

- E1: While the LLM could potentially provide general information on exercise physiology or create training materials based on general knowledge, it cannot replace the hands-on, personalized approach required for teaching group exercise sessions to clients with varying risk levels. The real-time assessment and adaptation needed for this task go beyond the capabilities of text-based tools.

- E2: It is challenging to imagine additional software built on top of the LLM that could effectively reduce the time it takes to complete this task by half. The task involves a high degree of human interaction, physical demonstration, and personalized instruction, which are not easily replicable through text-based tools or software.

- E3: The task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images, so the image capabilities provided by the LLM are not relevant to this task.
