1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of identifying interested and qualified customers to provide them with additional information as a Demonstrator or Product Promoter, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be facilitated by the use of a large language model (LLM).

- E1: Direct exposure - In this task, an LLM could assist in generating scripts or messages to attract potential customers, providing information about products or services, and even tailoring responses based on customer inquiries. The LLM could help in crafting persuasive language to engage with customers effectively. Additionally, it could assist in organizing and maintaining records of customer interactions.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the task could potentially benefit from additional software that integrates with the LLM to analyze customer data, preferences, and trends to identify potential leads more efficiently, the core task of identifying interested and qualified customers and providing them with information can be effectively accomplished with the LLM alone.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not directly relevant to the task of identifying and engaging with potential customers, as it primarily involves text-based interactions and customer interactions rather than image processing.

Based on the above analysis, the task of identifying interested and qualified customers to provide them with additional information as a Demonstrator or Product Promoter aligns most closely with E1: Direct exposure.
