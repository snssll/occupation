1: In this task, the Aircraft Mechanics and Service Technicians are required to accompany aircraft on flights to make in-flight adjustments and corrections. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. Accompanying aircraft on flights involves physical presence and hands-on work, which cannot be directly assisted by an LLM. The task requires real-time decision-making, observation, and physical interaction with the aircraft, which are beyond the capabilities of the LLM. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not involve text-based activities that can be significantly aided by the LLM.
