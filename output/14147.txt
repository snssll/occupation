1: In this task, the Court Reporters and Simultaneous Captioners are required to record symbols on computer storage media and use computer-aided transcription to translate and display them as text. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we can break down the task:
- Recording symbols on computer storage media: This involves capturing symbols, likely shorthand or specialized symbols used in court reporting, onto a computer storage medium. The LLM could potentially assist in transcribing these symbols accurately into text.
- Using computer-aided transcription to translate symbols into text: The LLM could be utilized to aid in the transcription process, converting the symbols into readable text.

Given that the task involves transforming symbols into text using computer technology, the LLM could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality. The LLM can assist in accurately transcribing the symbols and converting them into text, which aligns with tasks that can be completed more efficiently with the help of the model.
