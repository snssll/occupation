1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of evaluating new technologies and methods as a Quality Control Analyst, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be completed with the help of an LLM.

- Quality Control Analysts typically evaluate new technologies and methods by researching, analyzing data, and making recommendations based on their findings. This task involves a significant amount of text-based research, data analysis, and decision-making.
- An LLM can assist in researching and summarizing information about new technologies and methods, providing insights based on existing data, and even generating recommendations based on the input provided.
- The LLM can help in analyzing text data, summarizing research findings, and generating reports based on the information provided about new technologies and methods.
- While the LLM can provide valuable assistance in generating insights and recommendations, the task of evaluating new technologies and methods may require specialized domain knowledge and expertise that the LLM alone may not possess.

Based on these considerations, the task of evaluating new technologies and methods as a Quality Control Analyst could be classified as E2 - Exposure by LLM-powered applications.
