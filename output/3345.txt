1: In this task, a Computer User Support Specialist is required to confer with staff, users, and management to establish requirements for new systems or modifications. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we can break down the task into subtasks that an LLM could potentially assist with:
- Generating questions to ask staff, users, and management to gather requirements.
- Summarizing the information gathered from discussions.
- Providing feedback on the requirements discussed.
- Writing up the finalized requirements document.

Given that the task involves a significant amount of human interaction and decision-making, it is unlikely that the LLM alone can reduce the time it takes to complete the task by at least half. While the LLM could assist in generating questions and summarizing information, the complexity of the task and the need for nuanced communication with various stakeholders make it challenging for the LLM to significantly expedite the process.
