1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of decorating baked goods as a baker, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM in assisting with this task. The task involves a hands-on, physical aspect that cannot be directly performed by the LLM, as it requires the actual decoration of cakes or pastries. While the LLM can provide text-based instructions or ideas for decorating baked goods, it cannot physically carry out the decoration process. Therefore, the task does not fall under E1, E2, or E3 categories as it does not involve text-based work that can be significantly aided by the LLM or image capabilities.

2: E0

3: High
