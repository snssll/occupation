1: In this task, a Fabric and Apparel Patternmaker is required to test patterns by making and fitting sample garments. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. Testing patterns involves a hands-on approach that requires physical manipulation of fabric and garments. This task does not involve text input or output that can be directly processed by an LLM. The task also requires practical skills in garment construction and fitting, which cannot be replicated by an LLM. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM or any tools built on top of it.

2: E0
