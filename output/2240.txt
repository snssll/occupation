1: In this task, an orthoptist collaborates with other eye care specialists in the diagnosis, treatment, or management of various eye conditions. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves collaboration, communication, and decision-making based on medical knowledge and patient information. While the LLM can provide general information about eye conditions, it cannot replace the expertise of ophthalmologists, optometrists, or other specialists in making accurate diagnoses or treatment decisions. The task also involves real-time interaction and decision-making that goes beyond the capabilities of the LLM. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it requires a high degree of human interaction, specialized medical knowledge, and decision-making that cannot be effectively replaced by the LLM.
