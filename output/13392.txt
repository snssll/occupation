1: In this task, a farmworker is responsible for providing medical treatment to farm, ranch, and aquacultural animals. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves administering medications and vaccinations to animals or arranging for veterinarians to provide more extensive treatment. This task does not involve text-based activities that can be directly assisted by an LLM. It requires physical interaction with animals and medical procedures that cannot be performed by a language model. Therefore, the task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM or any tools built on top of it.

2: E0
