1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of cueing or signaling animals during performances as an Animal Trainer, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be impacted by the capabilities of the LLM.

- Animal training involves physical interaction and real-time observation of animal behavior, which cannot be directly influenced by text-based LLM capabilities.
- The task of cueing or signaling animals during performances requires hands-on training, understanding of animal behavior, and immediate feedback, which are not within the scope of text-based LLM capabilities.
- While the LLM could potentially provide theoretical information or general advice on animal training techniques, it cannot replace the practical skills and experience needed to effectively train animals for performances.
- The task does not involve written or spoken communication that could be significantly enhanced by the LLM.

Based on these considerations, the task of cueing or signaling animals during performances as an Animal Trainer would be classified as E0 - No exposure to LLM.
