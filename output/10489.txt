1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of observing hand signals, grade stakes, or other markings when operating machines as a Loading and Moving Machine Operator in Underground Mining, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves visual observation and interpretation of signals and markings, which are not text-based. The LLM does not have image capabilities to view, caption, or create images, so it cannot directly assist in this visual task. Additionally, the task does not involve text input or output that the LLM could process. Therefore, the task does not fall under E1, E2, or E3 exposure categories as the LLM alone cannot significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task.
