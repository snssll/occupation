1: In this task, the occupation involves handling explosives and setting off blasts. To label the task according to the exposure rubric, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone or with additional software could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality. Given the nature of the task, which involves physical handling of explosives and detonating devices, it is unlikely that the LLM or any software built on top of it could assist in completing this task. The task requires practical, hands-on skills and poses significant safety risks, making it unsuitable for automation through text-based tools like the LLM.
