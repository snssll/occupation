1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of preparing objectives and outlines for courses of study for various types of teachers, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM can assist in completing it. 

- The task involves writing and organizing text based on curriculum guidelines and requirements, which aligns well with the capabilities of the LLM in generating text and following specific instructions.
- The LLM can help in structuring the objectives and outlines by providing detailed and well-articulated content based on the input guidelines.
- While the task may require some level of expertise in education and curriculum design, the LLM can significantly reduce the time needed to draft and refine the course outlines and objectives.

Based on these considerations, the task falls under the category of E1 as direct access to the LLM can expedite the process of preparing objectives and outlines for courses of study with equivalent quality.
