1: In this task, a photographer is required to engage in research to develop new photographic procedures and materials. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves research, which may require reading and analyzing a variety of sources to gather information on new procedures and materials in the field of photography.
- The task does not involve any direct text input or output that can be easily processed by an LLM.
- While an LLM could potentially assist in summarizing existing research or providing insights based on the information provided, it may not significantly reduce the time it takes for a photographer to engage in the research process and develop new procedures and materials.

Based on these considerations, the task falls under E0 as it does not clearly decrease the time it takes for an experienced photographer to complete the task with high quality by at least half.
