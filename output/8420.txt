1: In this task, a Real Estate Sales Agent is required to interview clients to determine the types of properties they are seeking. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM can assist in completing it. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM can help in generating questions that the agent can ask during the client interview. It can also assist in preparing a structured interview script based on common property preferences. Additionally, the LLM can provide guidance on how to tailor questions to elicit specific information from clients effectively.
  
- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time it takes to interview clients, additional software could be developed to analyze client responses and preferences, providing tailored property recommendations based on the conversation. This software could integrate with the LLM to generate personalized property suggestions.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not relevant to this task as it involves interviewing clients verbally to understand their property preferences, which does not require image processing.
