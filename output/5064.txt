1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of developing or maintaining internal or external company websites as a Secretary or Administrative Assistant, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM in assisting with this task. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM can assist in writing and transforming text and code according to complex instructions, which could be useful for updating website content. It can also help in providing edits to existing text or code following specifications for website maintenance tasks. Therefore, direct access to the LLM could significantly reduce the time needed to complete this task with equivalent quality.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not reduce the time to complete website development tasks by half, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to automate certain aspects of website maintenance, such as generating code snippets or providing design recommendations. This additional software could potentially streamline the process and reduce the time required.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not directly relevant to website development tasks, as they primarily involve text and code. Therefore, this task does not fall under E3.

Considering the above points, the task of developing or maintaining company websites as a Secretary or Administrative Assistant could be best classified as E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications.
