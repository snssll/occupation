1: In this task, the helper-production worker is responsible for breaking up defective products for reprocessing. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. Breaking up defective products for reprocessing involves physical actions such as handling the products, identifying defects, and preparing them for reprocessing. This task does not involve text input or output, complex instructions, data analysis, or decision-making based on information processed by an LLM. As such, this task does not align with the capabilities of the LLM, even with additional software. The LLM cannot physically interact with objects or perform tasks that require physical manipulation. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not benefit from LLM capabilities.
