1: In this task, a Fraud Examiner, Investigator, or Analyst is required to prepare written reports of investigation findings. With access to the powerful OpenAI large language model (LLM), the examiner can efficiently draft detailed reports by inputting the investigation findings and allowing the LLM to assist in structuring the information, ensuring clarity, and providing additional insights or analysis. The LLM can help in organizing the content, suggesting relevant details to include, and ensuring the report is comprehensive and well-written. This task involves writing and transforming text according to complex instructions, providing edits to existing text following specifications, and maintaining records of written data. The LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality, making it suitable for an E1 label.
