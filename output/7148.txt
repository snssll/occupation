With access to the powerful OpenAI large language model (LLM), the assistant could potentially use the LLM to draft emails requesting the records, draft forms or templates for record collection, or even generate reminders for follow-ups. The LLM could also assist in organizing the gathered information or creating reports based on the collected records. Overall, the LLM could significantly reduce the time and effort required to complete this task by providing templates, drafting communication, and aiding in data organization.

Considering the capabilities of the LLM in generating text, templates, and assisting in data organization, this task falls under the E1 category. The LLM can directly reduce the time it takes to complete the task by providing text-based assistance and templates for communication and data organization.
