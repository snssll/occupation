1: In this task, the Funeral Attendants are responsible for performing various tasks during funerals to assist funeral directors and ensure that services run smoothly. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality. Funeral services involve a lot of human interaction, emotional sensitivity, and physical tasks that cannot be replaced by text-based AI models. The role of Funeral Attendants requires hands-on assistance, coordination with mourners, and physical tasks such as moving caskets, setting up equipment, and ensuring the smooth flow of the service. These aspects cannot be effectively handled by an LLM or any text-based AI tool.
