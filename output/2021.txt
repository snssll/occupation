1: For the task of cleaning facilities as an Usher, Lobby Attendant, or Ticket Taker, we can consider the exposure rubric provided. 

- E0: This task involves physical work that cannot be automated by the LLM or any software tools. It requires hands-on cleaning of facilities, which does not involve text input or output that the LLM can assist with.
- E1: The LLM can't physically clean facilities, but it can potentially assist in creating written instructions for cleaning procedures, documenting cleaning schedules, or generating reports on the cleanliness of facilities. However, the direct impact on reducing the time it takes to clean facilities may not be significant.
- E2: While the LLM could potentially be used to develop software tools for managing cleaning schedules, generating cleaning checklists, or providing training materials for cleaning staff, the direct impact on reducing the time it takes to clean facilities may not be substantial.
- E3: The task of cleaning facilities does not involve image capabilities that would significantly benefit from the LLM's assistance.

Considering the above points, the task of cleaning facilities for Ushers, Lobby Attendants, and Ticket Takers would likely fall under E0 as it involves physical work that cannot be significantly aided by the LLM.
