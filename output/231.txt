1: In this task, a flight attendant is required to administer first aid to passengers in distress. This task involves providing medical assistance to individuals who may be experiencing various health issues while on a flight. The task does not involve text input or output, and the context for the task is primarily practical and hands-on. The task requires physical interaction with passengers, assessing their medical needs, and providing appropriate care. Since the task does not involve writing, summarizing, translating, or any other text-based activities that an LLM could assist with, it is clear that the exposure to LLM is not applicable in this case.
