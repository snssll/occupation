1: In this task, the occupation involves selling and delivering plants and flowers to customers. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality. The task involves physical actions such as delivering plants and flowers, which cannot be directly assisted by the LLM. While the LLM could potentially help with tasks like generating sales pitches, managing inventory, or providing customer service information, the core task of physically selling and delivering plants and flowers would not be significantly impacted by the LLM alone.
