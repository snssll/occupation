1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of publishing research findings or presenting them at conferences and seminars as an Orthotist or Prosthetist, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be facilitated by the use of a large language model (LLM).

- E1: Direct exposure - In this case, an LLM could significantly reduce the time it takes to write research papers, prepare conference presentations, or even draft speeches for seminars. The LLM can assist in generating content, structuring information, and ensuring clarity in communication, which are essential for effective research dissemination.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While an LLM alone may not reduce the time to complete the task by half, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to streamline the process further. This could include tools for summarizing research findings, creating presentation slides, or even providing suggestions for engaging conference talks.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not directly relevant to the task of publishing research findings or presenting at conferences and seminars for Orthotists and Prosthetists. Therefore, this label is not applicable in this context.

2: E2

3: Moderate
