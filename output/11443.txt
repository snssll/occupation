1: In this task, a Veterinary Assistant or Laboratory Animal Caretaker is required to perform various medical procedures on animals, such as enemas, catheterizations, ear flushes, intravenous feedings, or gavages. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

Performing medical procedures on animals involves hands-on skills, knowledge of anatomy, and the ability to respond to unexpected situations. These tasks require physical interaction and precise movements, which cannot be directly performed by an LLM. The LLM lacks the ability to physically interact with animals or medical equipment, making it unsuitable for tasks that involve practical, hands-on procedures.
