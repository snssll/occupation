1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of receiving and processing payments from customers as an Online Merchant, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves handling electronic transactions, which can be quite straightforward and primarily text-based. The LLM can assist in generating responses to customers, providing information on payment processing procedures, and potentially even automating certain aspects of the payment process. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM can help in writing responses to customers, providing information on payment processing, and potentially automating some parts of the payment process, reducing the time it takes to complete the task significantly.
- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone can handle many aspects of this task, additional software could be developed to integrate with the LLM for more specialized payment processing tasks or to provide real-time updates on payment statuses.
- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not relevant for this task as it is primarily text-based and involves electronic transactions.
