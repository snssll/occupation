1: In this task, a Stocker or Order Filler is responsible for examining and inspecting stock items for wear or defects and reporting any damage to supervisors. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves inspecting physical stock items for wear or defects, which requires hands-on interaction and visual inspection. This task does not involve text input or output that can be easily processed by an LLM.
- The task does not involve complex instructions, writing, summarizing documents, or any other text-based activities that could benefit significantly from LLM capabilities.
- The task does not involve specialized domain knowledge, making recommendations, or analyzing written information to inform decisions that would require LLM assistance.
- The task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images, as it is primarily focused on physical inspection.

Based on these considerations, the task of examining and inspecting stock items for wear or defects is best classified as E0 - No exposure to LLM.
