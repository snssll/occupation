1: In this task, a roofer is responsible for waterproofing or damp-proofing various surfaces by painting, spraying, or attaching waterproofing membranes. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if the task can be significantly expedited or improved by using the LLM. Given the nature of the task, which involves physical work such as painting, spraying, and attaching membranes, it is unlikely that the LLM can directly assist in completing the task. The task requires manual labor, specialized tools, and physical presence, which are not within the capabilities of the LLM. Therefore, the task does not fall under E1, E2, or E3 categories.

2: E0

3: High
