1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of preparing scale drawings or architectural designs as an architect using computer-aided design (CAD) tools, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. 

- E0: This task involves technical skills and expertise in architecture, CAD software, and design principles that are not directly related to text-based tasks that the LLM excels at. The task also requires precise measurements and visual design, which are not within the LLM's capabilities.

- E1: While the LLM could potentially assist with writing reports, proposals, or other text-based documents related to architectural designs, it cannot directly create scale drawings or architectural designs using CAD tools. The task involves specialized knowledge and skills beyond text generation.

- E2: It is conceivable that additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to assist architects in generating initial design concepts based on input criteria or providing design recommendations. This software could potentially integrate with CAD tools to streamline the design process. However, the current capabilities of the LLM alone do not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task of preparing scale drawings or architectural designs.

- E3: The task does not involve image processing or detailed visual analysis that would benefit from additional image capabilities. While architects may work with visual representations of designs, the task primarily revolves around creating technical drawings and designs rather than image processing.
