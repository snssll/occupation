1: In this task, a curator is required to write and review various types of documents such as grant proposals, journal articles, institutional reports, and publicity materials. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM can assist in completing it. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM can be used to assist in writing and reviewing the mentioned documents by providing suggestions, generating content, and ensuring the text is coherent and well-written. The model can help with language refinement, structure, and even generate new ideas for the documents. This direct access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone can be beneficial in writing and reviewing documents, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to provide more specialized assistance for curators. This software could include features like summarizing longer documents, retrieving up-to-date information for inclusion in the documents, or even providing recommendations based on data analysis.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not relevant to this task as it primarily involves writing and reviewing text-based documents rather than dealing with images.
