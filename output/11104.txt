1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of overseeing or inspecting production processes as an Industrial Engineering Technologist or Technician, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be impacted by the use of the LLM.

- E1: Direct exposure - If the task involves documenting the production processes, providing feedback on process improvements, or communicating with team members about process inspections, the LLM could significantly reduce the time needed to write reports, analyze data, or generate recommendations based on the inspection findings. The LLM could assist in summarizing inspection reports, drafting emails to communicate findings, or even generating questions for further process improvement discussions.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not directly reduce the time it takes to oversee or inspect production processes, additional software built on top of the LLM could enhance the efficiency of data analysis, provide recommendations for process optimization, or even retrieve relevant industry knowledge to support decision-making during inspections.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Since the task of overseeing or inspecting production processes may involve reviewing visual data such as diagrams, schematics, or images of production lines, having access to image capabilities could aid in analyzing visual information more efficiently. The LLM could assist in reading text from images, scanning diagrams, or creating visual summaries of inspection findings.
