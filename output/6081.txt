1: In this task, an Aircraft Service Attendant is responsible for emptying and refilling aircraft lavatory systems. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves a specific and routine procedure that can be described in a straightforward manner.
- The task does not require complex decision-making or critical thinking beyond following established protocols.
- The task does not involve detailed measurements or intricate visual analysis.
- The task does not involve interactions that require human judgment or physical presence.
- The task does not involve accessing up-to-date information that is not already known to the worker.

Given these considerations, the task of emptying and refilling aircraft lavatory systems falls under E0 as it does not significantly benefit from the capabilities of an LLM or any additional software beyond what is commonly available.
