1: In this task, a Retail Loss Prevention Specialist is required to inspect buildings, equipment, or access points to determine security risks. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality. 

- E0: This task involves physical inspection and assessment of security risks in real-world settings, which cannot be directly assisted by the LLM.
- E1: The LLM could potentially assist in providing guidelines, checklists, or best practices for security inspections. It could also help in generating reports based on the findings of the inspection. However, the actual physical inspection and assessment would still need to be done manually.
- E2: While the LLM could potentially assist in generating reports or analyzing data related to security risks, it may not significantly reduce the time it takes to physically inspect buildings, equipment, or access points.
- E3: The task does not involve image capabilities that would significantly impact the time it takes to complete the inspection for security risks.

Based on the above analysis, the most appropriate label for this task would be E1.

2: E1

3: Moderate
