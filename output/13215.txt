1: In this task, a childcare worker is required to provide care for children with physical, developmental, or mental health disabilities. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes for a childcare worker to complete this task with high quality. The task involves hands-on care, interaction, and specialized knowledge in childcare for children with disabilities, which cannot be effectively replaced by text-based information or tools provided by the LLM. The task also requires empathy, physical presence, and real-time decision-making, which are not within the capabilities of the LLM. Therefore, the task does not align with the capabilities of the LLM or any tools built on top of it, resulting in a classification of E0.

2: E0

3: High
