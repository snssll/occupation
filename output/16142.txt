1: In this task, a Laundry and Dry-Cleaning Worker is required to sprinkle chemical solvents over stains and pat areas with brushes or sponges to remove stains. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. This task involves physical actions such as sprinkling solvents and patting areas, which cannot be directly performed by an LLM. The task does not involve complex decision-making, specialized knowledge retrieval, or detailed document analysis that would benefit significantly from LLM capabilities. Therefore, this task does not align with any of the exposure levels in the rubric.

2: E0

3: High
