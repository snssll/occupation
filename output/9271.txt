1: In this task, an air traffic controller is required to maintain communication with other control units to ensure the safe movement of aircraft. With the help of a large language model (LLM), the controller could potentially draft communication scripts, responses, or messages to coordinate aircraft movement more efficiently. The LLM could assist in generating clear and concise messages, ensuring accurate and timely communication. This would streamline the process of coordinating aircraft movement and improve overall efficiency.

Considering the nature of the task and the potential for the LLM to assist in generating communication scripts and responses, it falls under the category of E1 - Direct exposure. The LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to draft messages and coordinate communication, enhancing the effectiveness of the air traffic controller's role.
