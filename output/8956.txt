1: In this task of locating punctures in tubeless tires, the main steps involve visually inspecting the tires or immersing them in water baths to observe air bubbles. The task does not involve complex text input or output, specialized domain knowledge, or the need for image capabilities. It is a hands-on task that requires physical inspection and observation, which cannot be directly assisted by an LLM. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM or any tools built on top of it.
