1: In this task, a computer programmer is required to compile and write documentation of program development, including inserting comments in the coded instructions for better understanding by others. With the help of the LLM, the programmer can easily generate detailed documentation by describing the program development process, explaining the code logic, and providing insights into the revisions made. The LLM can assist in summarizing the key points, generating clear and concise explanations, and even suggesting best practices for commenting code effectively. Overall, the LLM can significantly reduce the time and effort required to create comprehensive documentation for program development.

Considering the task involves writing and transforming text according to complex instructions, providing edits to existing text following specifications, and preparing training materials based on general knowledge, it aligns with the capabilities of the LLM for tasks that can be completed with equivalent quality in less time. Therefore, this task falls under label E1 as direct access to the LLM can reduce the time it takes to complete the task by at least half.
