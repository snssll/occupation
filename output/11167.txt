1: In this task, a Molecular and Cellular Biologist is required to participate in various aspects of bioproduct development, including proposing new products, performing market analyses, designing and performing experiments, and collaborating with other teams. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be significantly expedited or improved by using the language model. 

- Writing and transforming text: The task involves proposing new products, which may require writing detailed proposals. The LLM can assist in generating well-written proposals based on input data and requirements.
- Providing feedback on documents: The biologist may need to provide feedback on reports, research findings, or product designs. The LLM can help in generating detailed feedback based on the input provided.
- Analyzing written information to inform decisions: Market analyses and experimental data interpretation are crucial parts of the task. The LLM can assist in analyzing written information to provide insights for decision-making.

Considering these points, the task can benefit from the LLM's capabilities in generating written content, providing feedback, and analyzing information, which would reduce the time and effort required to complete the task.
