1: In this task, the Surgical Assistants are responsible for assisting members of the surgical team with gowning or gloving. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. Since the task involves a physical action of assisting with gowning or gloving, it does not involve text input or output that can be processed by an LLM. The task requires physical interaction and manual assistance, which cannot be replaced by the capabilities of an LLM. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not involve any text-based processing that an LLM could assist with.
