1: In this task, a cleaner of vehicles and equipment is required to scrub, scrape, or spray machine parts, equipment, or vehicles using various tools and cleaning agents. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves physical actions such as scrubbing, scraping, and spraying, which cannot be directly performed by an LLM. While the LLM could potentially provide information on the best cleaning techniques or safety precautions, the actual cleaning process itself cannot be automated by the LLM. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not involve text-based activities that can be significantly expedited or enhanced by the LLM.
