1: In this task, a First-Line Supervisor of Gambling Services Workers is responsible for overseeing the cleaning and maintenance of slot machines and their surrounding areas. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves physical work such as cleaning and maintenance, which cannot be directly performed by an LLM.
- The task does not involve complex decision-making, specialized domain knowledge, or detailed data analysis that would significantly benefit from LLM capabilities.
- While the LLM could potentially provide information on best practices for cleaning and maintenance, the actual execution of the task requires physical presence and manual labor.

Based on these considerations, it is clear that the task of cleaning and maintaining slot machines and surrounding areas falls under E0 as it does not benefit from LLM capabilities in a way that would significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task.
