1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of estimating costs, production times, or staffing requirements for new designs as a Manufacturing Engineer, we need to consider the level of exposure to LLM.

- E0: This task involves a high degree of human expertise and judgment. Manufacturing Engineers typically rely on their specialized knowledge, experience, and understanding of manufacturing processes to estimate costs, production times, and staffing requirements accurately. While an LLM could potentially provide some general information or guidelines, the task itself requires a deep understanding of the specific context and industry nuances that may not be effectively captured by the model.

- E1: While an LLM could assist in providing general information on cost estimation, production times, or staffing requirements based on existing data and trends, the task of estimating these factors for new designs involves a high level of domain-specific knowledge and expertise. Manufacturing Engineers need to consider various factors such as material costs, labor requirements, equipment capabilities, and production processes, which may not be effectively addressed by the LLM alone. Therefore, the direct access to the LLM may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality.

- E2: It is conceivable that additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to assist Manufacturing Engineers in estimating costs, production times, or staffing requirements for new designs. This software could potentially integrate with existing databases, industry-specific knowledge, and real-time data to provide more accurate and tailored estimates. By leveraging the capabilities of the LLM along with specialized tools, the task could be completed more efficiently.

- E3: The task of estimating costs, production times, or staffing requirements for new designs does not involve image processing or visual data analysis, so exposure to image capabilities would not significantly impact the completion of this task.
