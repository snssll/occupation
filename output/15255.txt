1: In this task, the Electronic Equipment Installers and Repairers, Motor Vehicles need to run new speaker and electrical cables in motor vehicles. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality. 

Running new speaker and electrical cables involves physical work that cannot be directly assisted by the LLM. The task requires manual labor, knowledge of vehicle wiring systems, and practical skills that cannot be substituted by text-based instructions or information provided by the LLM. Therefore, the task does not fall under E1, E2, or E3 exposure categories.

2: E0

3: High
