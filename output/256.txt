1: In this task, an animal trainer is required to administer prescribed medications to animals. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. Administering medications to animals involves a practical, hands-on aspect that cannot be directly performed by an LLM. The task requires physical interaction with animals, understanding their behavior, and ensuring the correct dosage and method of administration. Since this task involves physical actions and direct contact with animals, it falls under the category of tasks that cannot be significantly aided by an LLM. Therefore, this task would be classified as E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM.
