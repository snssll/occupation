1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of returning assignments to students in accordance with established deadlines as a Teaching Assistant, Postsecondary, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it more efficiently. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The task involves a straightforward process of returning assignments to students within set deadlines. The LLM could assist in generating personalized feedback for each student, organizing the assignments, and sending reminders to students about upcoming deadlines. This could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the task may not require complex analysis or specialized domain knowledge, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to automate the assignment return process further. This software could include features like automatically grading assignments, providing detailed feedback based on student performance, and integrating with existing learning management systems to streamline the process.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not relevant for the task of returning assignments to students in accordance with established deadlines. This task primarily involves text-based communication and organization, which can be effectively handled by the LLM without the need for image capabilities.
