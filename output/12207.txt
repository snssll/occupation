1: In this task, Electromechanical Equipment Assemblers are required to position, align, and adjust parts for proper fit and assembly. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. This task involves physical manipulation of parts to ensure they fit together correctly, which cannot be directly assisted by an LLM. The task does not involve complex written instructions, data analysis, or specialized knowledge retrieval that could benefit significantly from LLM capabilities. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not align with any of the exposure levels described in the rubric.

2: E0

3: High
