1: In this task, a Video Game Designer is required to document all aspects of formal game design, including mock-up screenshots, sample menu layouts, gameplay flowcharts, and other graphical devices. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM and any additional tools that could be developed on top of it.

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM can assist in writing and transforming text, providing edits to existing text, and even generating some graphical descriptions based on text inputs. However, the task of creating mock-up screenshots, sample menu layouts, and gameplay flowcharts involves a significant visual and design component that may not be directly addressable by the LLM alone.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM may not directly reduce the time to complete this task, it is conceivable that additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to assist in creating graphical devices based on textual descriptions. This software could potentially summarize the textual input and generate basic graphical representations.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - The task involves creating graphical devices, which could benefit from image capabilities such as creating or editing digital images according to instructions. However, the LLM's current capabilities may not be sufficient to handle detailed graphical design tasks.

Based on the above analysis, the task of documenting all aspects of formal game design, including graphical devices, falls under E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications.
