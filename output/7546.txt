1: In this task, the occupation involves tutors who are responsible for identifying, developing, or implementing intervention strategies, tutoring plans, or individualized education plans (IEPs) for students. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM can assist in completing it. 

- E0: This task involves a high degree of human interaction and requires personalized assessment and planning for each student. The task also involves understanding the unique needs of each student, which may not be effectively addressed solely through text-based interactions with the LLM. Additionally, the task may require input from various stakeholders, including educators, parents, and the students themselves, which cannot be fully replicated by the LLM.

- E1: While the LLM can provide general information on intervention strategies, tutoring techniques, and IEPs, the task of developing individualized plans for students requires a deep understanding of each student's needs, learning style, and progress. The LLM may assist in generating initial ideas or providing background information, but the personalized nature of this task may not be significantly expedited by the LLM alone.

- E2: It is conceivable that additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to streamline the process of creating intervention strategies, tutoring plans, or IEPs. This software could potentially analyze student data, recommend personalized approaches based on educational research, and assist in drafting tailored plans. However, the complexity of this task and the need for human judgment in educational planning may limit the extent to which the LLM alone can reduce the time needed to complete the task by half.

- E3: The task does not involve image processing or detailed visual analysis, so the image capabilities of the LLM are not directly relevant to completing this task.
