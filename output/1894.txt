1: In this task, a welder is required to chip or grind off excess weld, slag, or spatter using various tools. This task involves physical work and precise manual labor that cannot be easily automated by a language model. The task requires hands-on skills, knowledge of different materials, and the ability to work with various tools and equipment. Since the task is highly manual and involves physical dexterity, it is unlikely that the LLM or any tool built on top of it could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with high quality. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not fit the criteria for exposure to LLM capabilities.

2: E0

3: High
