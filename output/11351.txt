1: In this task, a Music Director or Composer is required to perform administrative duties such as applying for grants, developing budgets, negotiating contracts, and designing promotional materials. With the help of the LLM, the composer can draft grant applications, budget proposals, contract negotiation strategies, and even generate content for promotional materials. The LLM can assist in providing templates, examples, and language suggestions for these administrative tasks. However, the LLM may not have the specific domain knowledge required for negotiating music-related contracts or understanding the intricacies of music program design. Therefore, while the LLM can significantly aid in drafting and generating content for administrative tasks, it may not fully replace the expertise needed for certain specialized aspects of the job.
