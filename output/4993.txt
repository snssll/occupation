1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of developing transportation-related computer software or processes as a Transportation Engineer, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. In this task, the Transportation Engineer would likely need to write and transform text and code according to complex instructions related to transportation systems and processes. The LLM can assist in generating code snippets, providing insights on best practices, and helping with problem-solving in software development. While the LLM alone may not reduce the time significantly for this task, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to streamline the process by providing specific transportation domain knowledge, recommending solutions, and analyzing complex data related to transportation systems. Therefore, this task falls under E2 as having access to the LLM alone may not reduce the time by half, but additional software could enhance the efficiency of completing the task.
