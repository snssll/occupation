1: In this task, the occupation involves farmworkers and laborers who manually harvest fruits and vegetables. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM could significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete the task with high quality by at least half.

- E0: This task involves physical labor that cannot be replaced by text-based interactions with the LLM. Harvesting fruits and vegetables by hand requires manual dexterity, physical presence, and interaction with the environment, which cannot be replicated by the LLM.

- E1: The LLM cannot physically harvest fruits and vegetables, so direct access to the LLM would not reduce the time it takes to complete this task.

- E2: While it is conceivable that additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to provide recommendations or information related to crop harvesting techniques, it would not significantly reduce the time it takes to physically harvest fruits and vegetables by hand.

- E3: The task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images, so the image capabilities of the LLM are not relevant here.

2: E0

3: High
