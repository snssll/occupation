1: In this task, a Compensation, Benefits, and Job Analysis Specialist is required to consult with various stakeholders such as business, industry, government, and union officials. The task involves acting as a technical liaison between these parties. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- E0: This task involves a high degree of human interaction and nuanced communication that may not be easily replaced by an LLM. The role of a technical liaison often requires understanding complex organizational dynamics, legal frameworks, and interpersonal relationships, which may not be effectively handled by an LLM alone. Additionally, the task may involve confidential information and sensitive negotiations that require human judgment and discretion.

- E1: While the LLM could potentially assist in drafting communication or providing background information on certain topics, the core aspect of serving as a technical liaison and consulting with various stakeholders involves a level of human interaction, empathy, and real-time decision-making that goes beyond the capabilities of the LLM.

- E2: It is conceivable that additional software could be developed to aid in summarizing information from various sources or providing recommendations based on data analysis. However, the fundamental aspect of being a technical liaison and engaging in complex interactions with multiple parties would still heavily rely on human judgment and expertise.

- E3: The task does not involve image-related capabilities, so this exposure level is not applicable.
