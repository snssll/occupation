1: In this task, a short-order cook is responsible for completing orders from steam tables, placing food on plates, and serving customers at tables or counters. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves a series of straightforward actions such as assembling food items, plating them, and serving customers. These actions do not require complex decision-making, critical thinking, or specialized knowledge beyond basic cooking skills. The task is primarily manual and involves physical interaction with customers. Since the task does not involve writing, analyzing text, or complex data processing that could benefit significantly from an LLM, it is unlikely that access to an LLM would reduce the time it takes to complete the task by at least half. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not align with the criteria for exposure to LLM.

2: E0

3: High
