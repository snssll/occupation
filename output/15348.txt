1: In this task, the Electric Motor, Power Tool, and Related Repairer is responsible for scraping and cleaning units or parts using cleaning solvents and equipment like buffing wheels. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if the task can be significantly expedited or improved by using the LLM. The task itself is very hands-on and physical, involving the manual cleaning of equipment. The LLM cannot physically interact with objects or perform tasks that require physical manipulation. While the LLM could potentially provide information on the best cleaning solvents or techniques, the core task of physically scraping and cleaning cannot be directly assisted by the LLM. Therefore, the task does not fall under E1, E2, or E3 exposure labels.

2: E0

3: High
