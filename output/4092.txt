1: In this task, a Floor Layer is required to cut flooring material to fit around obstructions. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be aided by the LLM. 

- E0: This task involves physical work that requires precise measurements and manual labor. The task of cutting flooring material around obstructions cannot be effectively automated by the LLM or any software tool. The LLM does not have the capability to physically cut materials or interact with physical objects.

- E1: The task of cutting flooring material around obstructions involves practical skills and physical work that cannot be directly assisted by the LLM. While the LLM could potentially provide guidance on techniques or safety measures in text form, it cannot directly perform the task or reduce the time significantly.

- E2: While the LLM could potentially provide general information on cutting techniques or safety precautions related to flooring installation, it is unlikely that additional software developed on top of the LLM could automate the physical task of cutting flooring material around obstructions. The task is highly specialized and requires hands-on skills that cannot be easily replicated by software.

- E3: The task of cutting flooring material around obstructions does not involve image processing or detailed visual instructions that would benefit from image capabilities. The task is more focused on physical execution rather than visual interpretation.
