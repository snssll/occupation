1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of monitoring fundamental economic, industrial, and corporate developments as a Financial and Investment Analyst, we need to consider the nature of the task and how an LLM could potentially assist in completing it. 

- E1: Direct exposure - An LLM could assist in summarizing information from financial publications, trade publications, and government agencies, providing insights into economic and corporate developments. It could also help in analyzing data and generating reports based on the information gathered. However, the task also involves personal interviews and interactions with company sources, which may require human judgment and interpretation that an LLM may not be able to provide accurately.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While an LLM could assist in analyzing information from various sources and generating reports, it may not be able to provide real-time updates or access up-to-date information from personal interviews or company sources unless explicitly provided in the input. Developing additional software on top of the LLM that can retrieve real-time data and integrate it with the analysis capabilities of the LLM could potentially enhance the efficiency of monitoring developments.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - This task does not involve image processing or analysis, so image capabilities would not significantly impact the completion of the task.

Considering the limitations of an LLM in conducting personal interviews and accessing real-time information without explicit input, the most appropriate label for this task would be E2.
