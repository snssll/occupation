1: In this task, the Dining Room and Cafeteria Attendants and Bartender Helpers are responsible for performing serving, cleaning, or stocking duties to facilitate customer service in establishments like cafeterias or dining rooms. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves routine activities that do not require complex decision-making or specialized knowledge beyond basic customer service skills. The task does not involve writing, summarizing documents, analyzing data, or any other activities that could be significantly enhanced by the use of an LLM. Therefore, this task does not benefit from direct exposure to an LLM, as the LLM cannot perform physical tasks or interact with customers in person. Additionally, developing software on top of the LLM to automate these physical tasks would not be feasible or practical. As a result, this task falls under E0 - No exposure.

2: E0
