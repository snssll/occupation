1: In this task, an umpire, referee, or sports official is responsible for keeping track of event times during sports games or races. With the help of an LLM, the official could potentially automate the process of tracking event times by inputting the rules of the game or race and having the LLM keep track of the times accurately. The LLM could also assist in starting or stopping play when necessary based on predefined criteria. This task involves writing and transforming text (rules of the game), providing edits to existing text (timekeeping records), and making decisions based on the input data. Therefore, this task could be significantly expedited and improved in accuracy with the assistance of an LLM.
