1: In this task, the gambling dealer's responsibility is to exchange paper currency for playing chips or coin money. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM could potentially assist in providing guidelines or scripts for interactions with customers, helping dealers communicate effectively or handle various scenarios. It could also help in generating training materials or FAQs related to currency exchange procedures. However, the direct interaction of exchanging physical currency for chips or coins cannot be automated by the LLM.
- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not reduce the time significantly for this task, it is conceivable that additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to streamline customer interactions, provide real-time currency exchange rates, or offer personalized recommendations based on customer preferences.
- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities would not be relevant for this task as it involves currency exchange and does not require image processing.

Considering the limitations of the task involving physical currency exchange and the lack of direct automation possible by the LLM, the most appropriate label seems to be E0.

2: E0

3: High
