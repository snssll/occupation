1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of preparing and submitting budget requests and grant proposals as an Education Administrator, I will consider the capabilities of the LLM in assisting with this task. The LLM can help in writing and transforming text according to complex instructions, providing edits to existing text following specifications, and generating content based on general knowledge. In this case, the task involves preparing written documents (budget requests and grant proposals) that require clear and persuasive language to solicit program funding. The LLM can assist in drafting these documents, ensuring they are well-written and structured to meet the requirements of budget requests and grant proposals.

Considering the nature of the task and the LLM's capabilities in assisting with writing and transforming text, providing edits, and generating content, it is evident that the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality. Therefore, this task falls under label E1 - Direct exposure.
