1: In this task, the main responsibility is taking pictures of individuals, families, and small groups in various settings. This task involves capturing visual images and does not directly involve text input or output. The task does not require the use of an LLM for completion as it is primarily focused on photography skills and equipment. While an LLM could potentially assist with tasks like editing photos or providing creative ideas for photoshoots, the core task of taking pictures itself does not significantly benefit from LLM capabilities. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not clearly decrease the time it takes for an experienced photographer to complete the task with high quality by at least half.

2: E0
