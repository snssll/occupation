1: In this task, a carpenter is required to remove damaged or defective parts of structures and repair or replace them using hand tools. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. Since the task involves physical work with hand tools, it does not directly involve text input or output that can be processed by an LLM. The task requires manual labor, skill in using tools, and knowledge of carpentry techniques, which cannot be replaced by text-based processing alone. Therefore, the task does not fall under E1, E2, or E3 as it does not involve text-based processing or image capabilities.

2: E0
