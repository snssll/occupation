1: In this task, the occupation involves landscaping and groundskeeping, specifically decorating gardens with stones or plants. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be aided by the LLM. 

- E0: This task involves physical work that requires hands-on interaction with the environment, such as placing stones and plants in a garden. The task also requires a level of creativity and aesthetic judgment that may be challenging for an AI model to replicate accurately.

- E1: While the LLM could potentially provide some general ideas or suggestions for garden decoration with stones or plants, the actual implementation of these ideas, considering factors like spatial arrangement, soil conditions, and aesthetic appeal, would still heavily rely on human judgment and physical work. The LLM may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality.

- E2: It is conceivable that software could be developed on top of the LLM to provide landscaping recommendations based on factors like garden size, climate, and plant compatibility. This software could potentially offer detailed design suggestions and material recommendations, which could assist groundskeepers in their work. However, the physical aspect of actually decorating the garden with stones or plants would still require human intervention.

- E3: The task of decorating gardens with stones or plants does not involve detailed images or text processing that would significantly benefit from image capabilities. The task is more about physical landscaping work and design aesthetics, which may not be directly enhanced by image capabilities.
