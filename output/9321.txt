1: In this task, a First-Line Supervisor of Landscaping, Lawn Service, and Groundskeeping Workers is responsible for maintaining required records, such as personnel information or project records. With the help of the LLM, the supervisor could potentially automate the process of record-keeping by generating templates, organizing data, and summarizing information. The LLM could assist in creating standardized formats for record-keeping, identifying key information from various sources, and even generating reports based on the data input. This task involves writing and transforming text, maintaining records of written data, and organizing information, all of which are capabilities of the LLM.

Considering the nature of the task and the potential for the LLM to significantly reduce the time and effort required to maintain records, I would classify this task as E1 - Direct exposure.
