1: In this task of interviewing and hiring new employees as Funeral Home Managers, the exposure to LLM can be evaluated as follows:

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM can assist in writing job descriptions, screening resumes, drafting interview questions, and even providing guidance on best practices for interviews. It can also help in drafting rejection or acceptance emails to candidates. Overall, the LLM can significantly reduce the time and effort required for the initial stages of the hiring process.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone can streamline parts of the hiring process, additional software could be developed to automate candidate sourcing, conduct background checks, or analyze candidate responses to interview questions. Such software could further enhance the efficiency of the hiring process beyond what the LLM can achieve on its own.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not relevant for the task of interviewing and hiring new employees, so this label does not apply.
