1: In this task, a Physical Therapist Aide is required to participate in patient care tasks such as assisting with passing food trays, feeding residents, or bathing residents on bed rest. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality. Since this task involves physical interaction with patients, which cannot be replaced by text-based interactions with the LLM, it is clear that the LLM cannot directly assist in completing this task. The task requires hands-on care and human interaction, which cannot be substituted by text-based tools or AI models.
