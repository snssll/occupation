1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of providing technical direction to other engineers as an Automotive Engineer, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be supported by the capabilities of the LLM.

- E0: This task involves providing technical guidance and direction to other engineers, which requires a high level of expertise, experience, and domain-specific knowledge. While the LLM can provide general information and explanations, it may not have the specialized knowledge and practical experience needed to effectively guide other engineers in automotive engineering tasks.

- E1: The LLM could potentially assist in generating written materials or explanations that could be used as part of the technical direction provided to other engineers. It could help in summarizing complex concepts, providing background information, or even drafting technical documents. However, the actual technical direction and guidance would likely still require human expertise and experience.

- E2: While the LLM could be used to access and summarize technical documents, research papers, or industry reports to inform the technical direction provided, it may not significantly reduce the time it takes to provide hands-on guidance to other engineers. Developing additional software on top of the LLM that can analyze and recommend specific technical solutions based on input data could potentially enhance the efficiency of providing technical direction.

- E3: The task of providing technical direction to other engineers does not involve image processing or visual content that would benefit from additional image capabilities. Therefore, the use of image capabilities alongside the LLM would not significantly impact the completion of this task.
