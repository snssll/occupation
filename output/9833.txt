1: In this task, the occupation of Tapers involves mixing sealing compounds either by hand or with portable electric mixers. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM could significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality. 

- E0: This task involves physical labor and manual work that cannot be directly replaced by the LLM. The task requires hands-on mixing of sealing compounds, which is not something the LLM can assist with.
- E1: The LLM cannot physically mix sealing compounds, whether by hand or with portable electric mixers. While it could potentially provide information on the best practices for mixing sealing compounds, it cannot directly perform the task itself.
- E2: While the LLM could potentially provide information on different types of sealing compounds, mixing techniques, or safety precautions, it cannot directly reduce the time it takes to physically mix the compounds.
- E3: The task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images, so the image capabilities of the LLM are not relevant here.

Based on the above analysis, the most appropriate label for this task is E0.

2: E0

3: High
