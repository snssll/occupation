1: In this task, the occupation of Bailiffs involves providing security and ensuring the safety of the jury members by escorting them to various locations outside the courtroom. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality. The task involves physical escorting and security measures, which cannot be directly assisted by the LLM. The LLM cannot perform physical tasks or interact with individuals in person, so it cannot directly assist in providing jury escort services. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not meet the criteria for exposure to LLM capabilities.

2: E0
