1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of applying theoretical expertise and innovation to create or apply new technology as a Computer and Information Research Scientist, we need to consider the level of exposure to LLM.

- E1: Direct exposure - In this task, the Computer and Information Research Scientist would likely rely on their expertise, knowledge, and creativity to develop new technologies. While the LLM could potentially provide information or insights on existing technologies or research papers, the core aspect of creating and applying new technology would heavily depend on the scientist's specialized knowledge and innovation. Therefore, direct access to the LLM may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While it is conceivable that additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to assist in summarizing research papers, retrieving specialized domain knowledge, or making recommendations based on data, the fundamental task of applying theoretical expertise and innovation to create new technology is highly specialized and may not be significantly accelerated by LLM-powered applications.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities would not be relevant for this task as it involves theoretical expertise and innovation in creating or applying new technology, which is primarily text-based and conceptual.

Considering the nature of the task and the level of expertise and creativity required, it is most appropriate to classify this task as E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications.

2: E2

3: Moderate
