1: In this task, a Maid or Housekeeping Cleaner is responsible for replenishing supplies such as drinking glasses, linens, writing supplies, and bathroom items. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if the task can be significantly expedited or improved by using the LLM. Since this task involves physical actions like restocking supplies, it does not directly involve text input or output that the LLM can assist with. The task does not require complex text transformation, writing, summarization, or any other text-based activities that the LLM excels at. Therefore, the task does not align with any of the exposure levels that involve text-based interactions with the LLM.
