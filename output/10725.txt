1: In this task, the Electrical Engineers are required to operate computer-assisted engineering or design software to perform engineering tasks. With the capabilities of the most powerful OpenAI large language model (LLM), the model could potentially assist in providing guidance on how to operate specific engineering software, troubleshoot common issues, or even suggest improvements in the engineering tasks being performed. The LLM could also help in generating documentation or reports related to the tasks carried out using the software. However, the task itself is more hands-on and technical, involving the actual operation of software or equipment, which may not be directly impacted by the LLM's text-based capabilities. While the LLM could provide some support in terms of information and guidance, the core aspect of operating the software or equipment would still require hands-on interaction.
