1: In this task, a Rail Car Repairer is required to adjust repaired or replaced units to ensure proper operation. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. This task involves hands-on work with physical rail car components, which cannot be directly influenced by the LLM. The task requires practical skills, physical manipulation of objects, and direct observation to ensure proper functioning. Since the task involves physical adjustments and operation checks, it falls under the category of tasks that cannot be significantly impacted by the LLM or any tools built on top of it. Therefore, this task would be classified as E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM or any LLM-powered applications.
