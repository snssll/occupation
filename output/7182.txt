1: In this task of grading and sorting agricultural products, the main focus is on evaluating various factors such as color, species, length, width, appearance, feel, smell, and quality. This task traditionally requires human judgment and sensory perception to assess the products accurately. While an LLM could potentially assist in providing general information about grading criteria or best practices, it cannot physically interact with the products to assess their quality based on sensory factors like smell or feel. The LLM also cannot replace the tactile experience needed to determine the quality of agricultural products accurately. Therefore, the task of grading and sorting agricultural products heavily relies on physical interaction and sensory perception, making it unsuitable for automation through LLM alone.
