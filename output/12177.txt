1: In this task, the Cooling and Freezing Equipment Operators and Tenders are required to position molds on conveyors and measure and adjust the level of fill using depth gauges. This task involves physical actions such as positioning molds and using depth gauges to measure and adjust the fill level. These actions cannot be directly performed by an LLM or any software tool based on it. The task also requires hands-on interaction with equipment, which is not something an LLM can assist with. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not involve text-based activities that can be automated or assisted by an LLM.
