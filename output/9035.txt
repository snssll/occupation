1: In this task, the Bridge and Lock Tenders are responsible for maintaining and guarding stations on bridges to check waterways for boat traffic. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves physical presence at the bridge stations, monitoring boat traffic, and ensuring the safe passage of boats through the waterways. This task requires human observation, interaction, and physical presence, which cannot be replaced by the LLM or any software tools. The task does not involve text input or output, and the critical aspects of the job are not related to written or spoken communication. Therefore, the task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM or any software tools mentioned in the exposure rubric.
