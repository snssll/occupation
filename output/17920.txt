1: For the task of writing or editing copy for clients as a Graphic Designer, the exposure to LLM can be evaluated as follows:

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** The LLM can assist in generating, editing, or refining text for clients based on specific instructions provided. It can help in crafting compelling copy, ensuring proper grammar and style, and tailoring the content to suit the client's needs. The LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to create or edit copy, making the process more efficient and potentially improving the quality of the output.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the LLM alone can be helpful in generating text, additional software specifically designed for copywriting or content creation could further enhance the efficiency of the task. Such software could provide templates, suggest creative ideas, or offer real-time feedback on the copy being written. These applications could leverage the LLM's capabilities to streamline the copywriting process even more.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Image capabilities are not directly relevant to the task of writing or editing copy for clients. Therefore, this task does not fall under E3.

Considering the above points, the task of writing or editing copy for clients as a Graphic Designer aligns best with **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications)**.
