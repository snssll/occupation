1: In this task, a Segmental Paver is responsible for preparing the surface by sweeping sand before it is opened to traffic. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if the task can be significantly expedited or improved by using the LLM or any tools built on top of it. Since this task involves physical labor and manual work, it does not seem like the LLM or any LLM-powered tools can reduce the time it takes to complete the task significantly. The task does not involve complex decision-making, data analysis, writing, or any other activities where the LLM could provide substantial assistance. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not benefit from LLM exposure.

2: E0

3: High
