1: In this task, a Clinical Research Coordinator collaborates with investigators to prepare presentations or reports of clinical study procedures, results, and conclusions. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves writing and transforming text based on complex instructions provided by investigators.
- It requires summarizing and organizing information related to clinical study procedures, results, and conclusions.
- The task may involve providing feedback on the content of the presentations or reports.
- The task does not require accessing up-to-date facts unless they are specifically related to the clinical study being reported.
- The task does not involve creating or editing digital images, reading text from PDFs, or any other image-related capabilities.

Given these considerations, the task falls under E1 as the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task by assisting in writing, summarizing, and organizing the information for presentations or reports.
