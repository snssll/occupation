1: In this task, a Meeting, Convention, and Event Planner is required to inspect event facilities to ensure they meet customer requirements. To complete this task, the planner needs to physically visit the event location, assess various aspects such as the layout, capacity, amenities, and overall suitability for the event. This task involves on-site inspection and evaluation, which cannot be directly facilitated by the LLM or any software tool. The planner needs to interact with the physical environment and make judgments based on real-world observations. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not involve text-based or image-related activities that could be significantly expedited or enhanced by the LLM.
