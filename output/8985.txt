1: In this task, a Maintenance Worker, Machinery is required to lubricate or apply adhesives to machines, machine parts, or equipment following specified procedures. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be impacted by the use of the LLM.

- E0: This task involves physical interaction with machinery and equipment, requiring hands-on work to apply lubricants or adhesives. The task does not involve text-based instructions or data analysis that could be significantly expedited by the LLM.

- E1: While the task involves following specified procedures, which could potentially be provided in text form, the actual application of lubricants or adhesives is a manual process that cannot be directly assisted by the LLM. Therefore, the LLM would not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality.

- E2: It is difficult to imagine additional software built on top of the LLM that could automate the physical application of lubricants or adhesives to machinery. The task is highly practical and requires hands-on work that goes beyond the capabilities of text-based processing.

- E3: The task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images. The use of image capabilities would not significantly impact the completion of this task.

2: E0
