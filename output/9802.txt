1: In this task, the occupation of Fence Erectors involves physically mixing and pouring concrete around bases of posts or tamping soil into postholes to embed posts. This task is very hands-on and requires physical labor. The task does not involve complex decision-making, analysis, or specialized knowledge that would benefit significantly from the use of an LLM. The LLM cannot physically mix concrete or tamp soil, and it cannot replace the physical aspect of this task. Therefore, the task does not align with any of the exposure levels in the rubric as it does not involve written or spoken communication, data analysis, decision-making, or any other area where an LLM could provide assistance.
