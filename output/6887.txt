1: Dental Laboratory Technicians fabricate, alter, or repair dental devices such as dentures, crowns, bridges, inlays, or appliances for straightening teeth. To determine the appropriate exposure label for this task, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be aided by the use of a large language model (LLM).

- Dental Laboratory Technicians require specialized knowledge and skills in dental technology to fabricate, alter, or repair dental devices. This task involves hands-on work with materials and equipment, which cannot be directly assisted by an LLM.
- While an LLM could potentially provide information on dental procedures, materials, or techniques, the practical aspect of fabricating, altering, or repairing dental devices involves physical manipulation and craftsmanship that an LLM cannot perform.
- The task does not involve extensive written communication, complex data analysis, or information retrieval that would significantly benefit from LLM capabilities. The primary focus is on practical, technical skills related to dental device fabrication.

Based on these considerations, the task of fabricating, altering, or repairing dental devices as a Dental Laboratory Technician would be classified as E0 - No exposure.
