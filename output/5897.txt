1: In this task, a Shoe and Leather Worker and Repairer is required to draw patterns based on measurements, designs, plaster casts, or customer specifications, and then position or outline these patterns on workpieces. This task involves a high level of manual dexterity, creativity, and understanding of materials. The task does not involve text input or output, and the context is primarily visual and tactile. The LLM, even with additional software, cannot directly assist in drawing patterns, taking measurements, or physically positioning patterns on workpieces. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM or any software that could be developed on top of it.

2: E0

3: High
