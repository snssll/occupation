1: In this task, a Highway Maintenance Worker is required to inspect, clean, and repair various structures such as drainage systems, bridges, and tunnels. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone or additional software built on top of the LLM could significantly reduce the time it takes for a worker to complete this task with high quality. 

- The task involves physical inspection, cleaning, and repair work on structures, which cannot be directly assisted by the LLM.
- While the LLM could potentially provide information on best practices for maintenance, safety guidelines, or troubleshooting tips, the actual hands-on work of inspecting, cleaning, and repairing physical structures requires manual labor and expertise that the LLM cannot provide.
- There are no text-based or data-driven aspects of this task that could be significantly expedited by the LLM or software built on top of it.

Based on these considerations, the task of inspecting, cleaning, and repairing drainage systems, bridges, tunnels, and other structures as a Highway Maintenance Worker would be classified as E0 - No exposure.
