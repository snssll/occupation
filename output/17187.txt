1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of training staff and users to work with computer systems and programs as a Computer Systems Analyst, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. In this task, the LLM can assist in providing written training materials based on general knowledge related to computer systems and programs. The model can generate detailed instructions, explanations, and examples to help train staff and users effectively. It can also answer questions about the training materials, provide feedback on documents, and potentially even create interactive training modules. However, the task does not involve highly specialized domain knowledge or complex databases, which would require additional software beyond the LLM's capabilities. Therefore, the task falls under E1 as the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to prepare training materials and support the training process.
