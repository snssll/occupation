1: In this task of cutting and welding metal to repair broken parts or fabricate new ones, the exposure to LLM can be evaluated as follows:

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** The task involves manual work that cannot be directly assisted by the LLM. While the LLM can provide information on welding techniques, safety precautions, or metal properties, it cannot physically cut or weld metal. Therefore, the task does not fit the criteria for E1 exposure.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the LLM could potentially provide information on specific welding techniques, materials, or safety guidelines, the task itself is hands-on and requires physical manipulation of metal. It is challenging to imagine additional software that could be developed on top of the LLM to significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task. Therefore, the task does not align with E2 exposure.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** The task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images. The use of images or image capabilities is not relevant to the physical task of cutting and welding metal. Therefore, the task does not fall under E3 exposure.
