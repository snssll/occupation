1: In this task, a brickmason or blockmason is responsible for spraying or spreading refractory material over brickwork to protect it from deterioration. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. This task involves a physical aspect of applying refractory material, which cannot be directly performed by an LLM or any software tool. The task requires hands-on work and specific skills related to masonry work. While an LLM could potentially provide information on the types of refractory materials or techniques used, it cannot physically apply the material. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not involve text-based work that can be significantly aided by an LLM.
