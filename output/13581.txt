1: In this task, a potter is required to pull wires through the bases of articles and wheels to separate finished pieces. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves physical manipulation of objects, specifically pulling wires through bases, which requires manual dexterity and tactile feedback. This task does not involve text input or output, and the context is primarily physical rather than informational. As such, the task does not align with the capabilities of the LLM, which is focused on text-based tasks and does not have the ability to perform physical actions. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not benefit from the capabilities of the LLM.

2: E0
