1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of installing new robotic systems in stationary positions or on tracks as a Robotics Technician, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be impacted by the use of the LLM.

- The task involves physical installation of robotic systems, which requires hands-on work and cannot be directly assisted by the LLM.
- While the LLM could potentially provide information on best practices for installation, safety guidelines, troubleshooting tips, or specific technical details, the core task of physically installing the systems cannot be completed by the LLM alone.
- The LLM could assist in generating documentation, manuals, or instructions related to the installation process, but the actual installation work would still need to be done manually.

Based on these considerations, the task of installing new robotic systems would fall under E0 as it involves physical work that cannot be significantly expedited or replaced by the LLM.
