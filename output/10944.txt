1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of optimizing digital assets for search engine optimization (SEO) or display and usability on internet-connected devices as a Search Marketing Strategist, we need to consider the level of exposure to LLM.

- E1: Direct exposure - This task involves working with text, graphics, and multimedia assets, which can benefit from the LLM's capabilities in generating and transforming text. The LLM can assist in providing insights, suggestions, and even generating content that aligns with SEO best practices. Therefore, direct access to the LLM could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the task may not be reduced by half with just access to the LLM, additional software built on top of the LLM could enhance the optimization process. For example, an application that can analyze SEO trends, provide real-time data on search engine algorithms, or generate optimized content based on the latest SEO practices could further streamline the optimization process.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - This task primarily involves optimizing digital assets, which may include graphics and multimedia. While the LLM itself may not directly interact with images, having image capabilities could aid in creating or editing visual content according to instructions, which could complement the text-based optimization efforts.

Considering the nature of the task and the potential benefits of leveraging the LLM's text generation and analysis capabilities, as well as the possibility of developing software applications to enhance the optimization process, the most fitting label for this task appears to be E2.
