1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of performing laboratory studies in the manufacture of new products as a Chemical Engineer, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be impacted by the use of a large language model (LLM).

- Chemical Engineers typically conduct experiments, analyze data, and make decisions based on their findings. While an LLM could potentially assist in providing background information, theoretical knowledge, or even suggesting experimental procedures, the core of the task involves hands-on work in a laboratory setting.
- The task involves physical experimentation, data collection, and analysis, which are not directly related to text-based tasks that an LLM excels at.
- While an LLM could potentially assist in generating reports, summarizing findings, or providing theoretical insights, the primary aspect of conducting laboratory studies in chemical engineering involves practical, hands-on work that cannot be directly replaced by an LLM.
