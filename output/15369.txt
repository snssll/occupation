1: In this task, the occupation involves packers and packagers who seal containers or materials using various methods such as glues, fasteners, nails, and hand tools. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be significantly enhanced or expedited by using the language model. Since the task involves physical actions like sealing containers with hand tools, it does not directly involve text-based activities that the LLM can assist with. The task does not require complex text transformation, writing, summarization, or any other text-related functions that the LLM excels at. Therefore, the task does not fall under E1, E2, or E3 exposure levels.

2: E0

3: High
