1: For the task of using data entry devices to input data into computers for revision or editing, the most relevant exposure label from the rubric would be E0. This task involves physical interaction with data entry devices like optical scanners, which cannot be directly assisted by the LLM or any LLM-powered tools. The task does not involve complex decision-making, specialized knowledge retrieval, or image processing that would benefit from LLM capabilities. Therefore, the task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM.

2: E0

3: High
