1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of observing and monitoring equipment operation during the extraction process to detect any problems for Helpers--Extraction Workers, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be supported by the capabilities of the LLM.

- E0: This task involves direct observation and monitoring of equipment, which requires physical presence and real-time decision-making based on visual and auditory cues. The task does not involve text-based inputs or outputs that can be easily processed by the LLM.

- E1: The task does not involve text-based inputs or outputs that can be directly processed by the LLM. While the LLM could potentially provide information on common problems or troubleshooting tips related to extraction equipment, it cannot replace the real-time observation and decision-making required for this task.

- E2: While the LLM could potentially be used to access information on equipment operation and troubleshooting procedures, it would not significantly reduce the time it takes to observe and monitor equipment operation during the extraction process in real-time. However, additional software could be developed to provide real-time alerts or predictive maintenance recommendations based on data collected from the equipment, which could enhance the efficiency of the monitoring process.

- E3: The task does not involve image processing or analysis that would benefit from additional image capabilities beyond the LLM's text-based processing abilities.
