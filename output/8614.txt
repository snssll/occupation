1: In this task, a cashier is responsible for issuing receipts, refunds, credits, or change to customers. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. Issuing receipts, refunds, credits, or change involves basic transactional activities that do not require complex language processing or specialized knowledge beyond standard retail practices. The task is straightforward and does not involve in-depth analysis, decision-making, or specialized domain knowledge. Therefore, the task does not significantly benefit from the capabilities of a large language model like OpenAI's LLM. As such, the task falls under E0 as it does not meet the criteria for exposure to LLM capabilities.

2: E0

3: High
