1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of contacting businesses or civic establishments to arrange to exhibit and sell merchandise as a Demonstrator and Product Promoter, we need to consider the level of exposure to LLM.

- E1: Direct exposure - If the task involves writing emails, making phone calls, or drafting communication materials to contact businesses, the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete these tasks by providing templates, suggestions, or even drafting the content itself. The LLM can assist in crafting persuasive messages or negotiating terms, ultimately improving efficiency and quality.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not reduce the time it takes to complete the task by half, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to streamline the process further. For example, an application could analyze data on potential businesses to contact, suggest optimal times for outreach, or even provide insights on effective sales strategies based on existing knowledge.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities would not significantly impact the task of contacting businesses or civic establishments to arrange merchandise exhibitions. This task primarily involves written communication and coordination, which does not heavily rely on image processing.

Considering the nature of the task and the potential for the LLM to assist in generating communication materials, providing templates, or even suggesting strategies, the most fitting label appears to be E1: Direct exposure.
