1: In this task, a Boilermaker is responsible for cleaning pressure vessel equipment using scrapers, wire brushes, and cleaning solvents. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality.

- E0: This task involves physical labor and hands-on work that cannot be replaced by text-based interactions with the LLM. The task requires manual dexterity and direct interaction with equipment, making it unsuitable for automation through the LLM.
- E1: The task description does not involve complex text transformations, writing, or information retrieval that would benefit significantly from direct access to the LLM. The task is more focused on manual labor and practical skills rather than text-based interactions.
- E2: While it is conceivable that software could be developed to provide guidance or instructions on cleaning pressure vessel equipment, the core task of physically cleaning with scrapers, wire brushes, and solvents cannot be automated through text-based interactions with the LLM.
- E3: The task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images. The nature of the task is more hands-on and practical, making it unsuitable for the image capabilities of the LLM.

Based on the analysis, the most appropriate label for this task is E0.

2: E0

3: High
