1: Wind Energy Engineers are responsible for providing engineering technical support to designers of prototype wind turbines. To determine the appropriate exposure label for this task, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be completed with the help of an LLM.

- Wind Energy Engineers need to possess specialized engineering knowledge related to wind energy systems and turbines. The task involves providing technical support to designers, which may include answering specific engineering questions, providing calculations, and offering design recommendations.
- An LLM could assist in providing background information on wind energy systems, explaining engineering concepts, generating sample calculations, and offering suggestions based on existing knowledge.
- While the LLM can provide general information and potentially assist with some aspects of the task, it may not have the specialized domain knowledge required to fully support the designers of prototype wind turbines. The task involves complex engineering principles and specific technical details that may not be within the scope of the LLM's capabilities.
