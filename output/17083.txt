1: In this task, a Fabric and Apparel Patternmaker is required to trace outlines of paper patterns onto cardboard and cut them to create templates. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality. 

- The task involves manual work that cannot be directly replaced by text input and output from the LLM.
- The task requires physical actions such as tracing and cutting, which cannot be performed by the LLM.
- The task does not involve complex decision-making or analysis that could be automated by the LLM.
- The task does not involve written or spoken communication that could be facilitated by the LLM.

Based on these considerations, it is clear that the task of tracing outlines of paper patterns onto cardboard and cutting them to create templates does not have exposure to the LLM. The LLM cannot perform physical tasks or replace the manual labor involved in this task.
