1: In this task, the occupation involves providing assistance in the safe use of equipment, such as ski lifts. To complete this task, a worker would need to ensure the safety of individuals using the equipment, provide guidance on how to use the equipment properly, and intervene in case of emergencies. With the help of the LLM, a worker could potentially generate safety guidelines, instructions on equipment usage, and emergency response protocols. The LLM could also assist in creating training materials for individuals on how to safely use ski lifts. However, the task itself involves a significant amount of hands-on interaction and real-time decision-making, which cannot be fully automated by the LLM. Therefore, the exposure to the LLM for this task would not significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete it.
