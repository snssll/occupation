1: In this task, the actor reads from scripts or books to narrate action or to inform or entertain audiences without using many stage props. To complete this task, the actor needs to have good reading skills, understanding of the text, and the ability to convey emotions and engage the audience through their voice modulation and expression. The task does not involve any direct interaction with the LLM, as it is more focused on performance and interpretation of the text rather than generating new content. The LLM may not significantly reduce the time it takes for an actor to perform this task, as it requires human creativity, expression, and performance skills that cannot be replicated by the LLM alone.
