1: Special Effects Artists and Animators typically create visual effects for various forms of media, such as movies, television shows, video games, and advertisements. The task provided involves creating pen-and-paper images that will later be scanned, edited, colored, textured, or animated by computer. In this case, the task involves the initial creation of visual content using traditional methods before transitioning to digital editing and manipulation.

Considering the task description, the use of an LLM alone would not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task. While an LLM could potentially assist with generating ideas, providing feedback on concepts, or even suggesting digital effects, the core aspect of creating pen-and-paper images would still require manual artistic skills that the LLM cannot replicate. Therefore, the task does not fall under E1.

However, it is easy to imagine additional software that could be developed on top of the LLM to assist Special Effects Artists and Animators in tasks such as generating initial concept ideas, providing inspiration, or even automating certain aspects of the digital editing process. This additional software could potentially reduce the time it takes to complete the task by half. Therefore, the task falls under E2.
