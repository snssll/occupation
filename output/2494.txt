1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of communicating regulatory information to multiple departments and ensuring correct interpretation as a Regulatory Affairs Manager, we need to consider the nature of the task and the potential impact of using an LLM.

- This task involves a significant amount of written communication, which can benefit from the LLM's capabilities in generating clear and concise messages.
- The LLM can assist in summarizing complex regulatory information, drafting emails, and providing accurate interpretations of regulations.
- While the task may involve some level of domain-specific knowledge, the LLM can still aid in ensuring that information is communicated effectively across departments.

Based on these considerations, the task can be categorized as E1, as direct access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality by at least half.
