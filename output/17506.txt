1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of using computer software to generate new images as a Graphic Designer, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM and its potential impact on the task.

- E1: Direct exposure - The task involves using computer software to create images, which can be a time-consuming process. The LLM could potentially assist in generating ideas for new images, providing creative suggestions, or even helping with the design process through text-based instructions. The LLM could significantly reduce the time it takes to brainstorm ideas and provide initial design concepts, thus improving efficiency in the image creation process.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM itself may not directly reduce the time it takes to generate new images, additional software built on top of the LLM could enhance the capabilities for graphic design tasks. For example, an application that can understand design briefs, suggest color schemes, or provide design templates based on text inputs could streamline the image creation process for Graphic Designers.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - The task of generating new images involves working with visual content, which could benefit from image capabilities such as viewing, captioning, and creating images. While the LLM itself may not have these image capabilities, a system that complements the LLM by handling image-related tasks could significantly enhance the efficiency of creating new images for Graphic Designers.

Based on the considerations above, the task of using computer software to generate new images as a Graphic Designer aligns most closely with E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications.
