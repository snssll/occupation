1: In this task, a Conservation Scientist is required to respond to complaints or questions on wetland jurisdiction by providing information or clarification. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves responding to complaints or questions, which can be formulated as text input and text output within the 2000-word context limit of the LLM.
- The task requires providing information or clarification, which can be achieved through writing and transforming text according to complex instructions.
- The task does not involve highly specialized domain knowledge or up-to-date facts retrieval from the internet, as the information needed for responding to complaints or questions on wetland jurisdiction is likely within the scope of general knowledge or organizational guidelines.

Based on these considerations, the task can be effectively completed with the direct access to the LLM, as the model can assist in generating responses to complaints or questions on wetland jurisdiction. Therefore, the appropriate exposure label for this task is E1.
