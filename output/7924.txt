1: In this task, the Appraisers and Assessors of Real Estate need to inspect new construction and major improvements to existing structures to determine their values. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we can break down the task:
- **Inspect new construction and major improvements**: The LLM can provide information on common practices in construction and improvements, as well as factors that may affect property values. It can generate text describing what to look for during inspections.
- **Determine values**: The LLM can assist in providing data on property values based on various factors like location, size, amenities, and market trends. It can help in analyzing this data to arrive at a valuation.

Considering the task involves a combination of analyzing data, understanding construction practices, and making value judgments, the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality. The LLM can provide guidance on what to inspect and offer insights into property valuation, making the process more efficient.
