1: In this task, a Captain, Mate, or Pilot of Water Vessels is required to serve as a vessel's docking master upon arrival at a port or berth. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves a specific set of instructions and actions that can be described in text form.
- The task does not require precise measurements or detailed visual analysis.
- The task does not involve interactions that require human judgment or decision-making beyond following a set procedure.
- The task does not involve accessing up-to-date facts from the internet or specialized domain knowledge beyond the scope of the task itself.

Based on these considerations, the task of serving as a vessel's docking master can be effectively described and completed using text instructions alone, making it suitable for exposure label E1.
