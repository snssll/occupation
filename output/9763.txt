1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of meeting with parents and guardians to discuss their children's progress and determine priorities and resource needs, we need to consider the nature of the task. This task involves communication, understanding individual needs, and making decisions based on the information gathered during the meeting. An LLM could potentially assist in preparing for these meetings by providing suggested questions to ask, summarizing key points, or even drafting follow-up emails.
