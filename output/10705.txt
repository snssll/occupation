1: In this task, the Food Cooking Machine Operators and Tenders are required to operate auxiliary machines and equipment to prepare or further process products. This task involves a hands-on approach to operating machinery and equipment in a food processing setting. The task does not involve complex decision-making, analysis, or specialized knowledge that would benefit significantly from the use of a large language model (LLM). The task is more focused on physical actions and manual operations rather than text-based or knowledge-intensive activities that an LLM could assist with. Therefore, the task does not align with any of the exposure levels in the rubric.
