1: In this task, a real estate broker is responsible for obtaining agreements from property owners to list their properties for sale with their real estate firm. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves communication, negotiation, and legal agreements. While an LLM could potentially assist in drafting communication or agreement templates, it cannot replace the human interaction and negotiation skills required to convince property owners to list their properties. The task also involves legal aspects that may require specific expertise beyond what an LLM can provide. Therefore, the task does not seem to be significantly reducible by using an LLM alone, as it heavily relies on human interaction and negotiation skills.
