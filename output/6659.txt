1: In this task, the Aviation Inspectors are required to examine maintenance records and flight logs to ensure that service and maintenance checks are conducted at the specified intervals. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves analyzing written data (maintenance records and flight logs) to verify compliance with regulations and safety standards.
- The task does not require specialized domain knowledge beyond aviation regulations and maintenance procedures.
- The task does not involve creating or editing digital images, reading text from PDFs, or any image-related capabilities.
- The task does not involve interacting with physical objects or precise measurements.
- The task does not involve making decisions that impact human livelihood or legal requirements that necessitate human intervention.

Based on these considerations, the task does not significantly benefit from the capabilities of an LLM or any additional software beyond what is commonly available. Therefore, the task falls under E0 as the use of an LLM or LLM-powered tool would not substantially reduce the time it takes for an experienced Aviation Inspector to complete the task.
