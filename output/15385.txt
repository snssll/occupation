1: In this task, a lawyer needs to search for and examine legal records to write opinions or establish ownership. With access to the powerful OpenAI large language model (LLM), the lawyer could potentially save time by quickly searching for legal records, analyzing them, and drafting opinions based on the information found. The LLM can assist in summarizing legal documents, providing insights, and even generating drafts of legal opinions. This would significantly reduce the time it takes for a lawyer to conduct research and draft legal documents.

Considering the capabilities of the LLM to assist in legal research, document analysis, and opinion drafting, this task falls under E1 - Direct exposure. The LLM can directly reduce the time it takes for a lawyer to complete the task with equivalent quality by at least half.
