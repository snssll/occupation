1: In this task, a Laundry and Dry-Cleaning Worker is responsible for starting pumps to operate distilling systems that drain and reclaim dry cleaning solvents. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone or additional software built on top of the LLM could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality.

- Direct exposure (E1): The task of starting pumps and operating distilling systems involves physical actions and technical knowledge related to machinery and equipment. The LLM, even with direct access, cannot physically start pumps or operate machinery. Therefore, it cannot reduce the time it takes to complete this task significantly.

- Exposure by LLM-powered applications (E2): While it's conceivable that software could be developed to provide guidance or instructions on operating distilling systems, the complexity and specificity of this task may require hands-on experience and technical expertise that go beyond what the LLM can provide. Thus, the LLM alone may not reduce the time significantly.

- Exposure given image capabilities (E3): Image capabilities would not be relevant for this task as it involves operating machinery and equipment, not interpreting or creating images.

Based on the analysis above, the task of starting pumps to operate distilling systems in a laundry and dry-cleaning setting is best classified as E0.

2: E0

3: Certainty level: High
