1: In this task, a Nuclear Medicine Technologist is responsible for preparing stock radiopharmaceuticals while ensuring safety standards are met to minimize radiation exposure to workers and patients. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves following specific safety standards and procedures, which may require detailed knowledge and expertise in nuclear medicine.
- The task does not involve writing or transforming text, summarizing documents, or providing feedback on documents, which are typical tasks that can be easily assisted by an LLM.
- While the LLM could potentially provide information on safety standards and procedures, the critical aspect of this task is the hands-on preparation of radiopharmaceuticals, which cannot be directly assisted by the LLM.
- The task does not involve image capabilities, as it primarily focuses on the preparation of radiopharmaceuticals rather than analyzing or creating images.

Based on these considerations, the task of preparing stock radiopharmaceuticals in adherence to safety standards that minimize radiation exposure to workers and patients would be classified as E0 - No exposure.

2: E0

3: High
