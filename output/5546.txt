1: In this task, the Nuclear Power Reactor Operators are required to direct operations during emergency situations following specific procedures. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be significantly expedited or improved by using the language model. 

- Direct exposure (E1): If the task involves providing step-by-step instructions, guidance, or communication during emergency situations, the LLM could assist in generating clear and concise directives based on the emergency operating procedures. The model could help in formulating responses, instructions, or communication strategies quickly and effectively, potentially reducing the time needed to coordinate actions during emergencies.

- Exposure by LLM-powered applications (E2): While the LLM alone may not reduce the time significantly for this task, additional software could be developed to integrate real-time data analysis, scenario simulations, or decision-making support tools based on the LLM's capabilities. Such software could enhance the operators' ability to make informed decisions during emergencies by providing relevant information, analyzing complex situations, or suggesting optimal courses of action.

- Exposure given image capabilities (E3): Since the task primarily involves directing operations and communication during emergencies, image capabilities may not directly impact the completion of this task. Image processing tools would not significantly enhance the operators' ability to manage emergency situations or follow emergency procedures.
