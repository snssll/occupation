1: In this task, the occupation involves installing electrical equipment in transportation equipment using hand tools. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be significantly expedited or improved by using the LLM. The task involves physical work with hand tools, which cannot be directly replaced by the LLM. The LLM cannot physically install equipment or use hand tools. While the LLM could potentially provide information on electrical equipment installation procedures or troubleshooting tips, the nature of the task primarily involves manual labor and technical skills that are not within the LLM's capabilities. Therefore, the task does not align with any of the exposure levels in the rubric.
