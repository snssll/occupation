1: In this task, a Transportation, Storage, and Distribution Manager is required to implement specific customer requirements, such as internal reporting or customized transportation metrics. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves understanding customer requirements and implementing them, which may require some level of decision-making and customization based on specific needs.
- While the task involves text input and output, it also requires domain-specific knowledge related to transportation and logistics.
- The task may involve analyzing data and creating reports, which could benefit from the LLM's ability to process and generate text.
- However, the task also involves practical implementation and decision-making that may not be solely text-based and could require hands-on management skills.

Considering these factors, the task falls under E2 - Exposure by LLM-powered applications. While the LLM can assist in generating reports and analyzing text-based information, additional software tailored to the transportation and logistics domain would be needed to fully automate the task.
