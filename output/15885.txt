1: In this task, an usher, lobby attendant, or ticket taker is required to settle seating disputes or help solve other customer concerns. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone or with additional software could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality.

- E0: This task involves direct human interaction and decision-making that may require empathy, conflict resolution skills, and real-time judgment. The LLM cannot replace the human touch needed in such situations.

- E1: While the LLM could potentially provide scripted responses or guidelines for handling customer concerns, the real-time nature of the task and the need for interpersonal skills make it challenging for the LLM to significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality.

- E2: It is conceivable that software could be developed to assist ushers, lobby attendants, or ticket takers in handling customer concerns more efficiently, but this would likely require a combination of real-time communication tools, AI-driven decision support systems, and potentially image recognition capabilities to assess seating arrangements or customer expressions.

- E3: Image capabilities would not significantly impact the task of settling seating disputes or addressing customer concerns in this context.

2: E0

3: Moderate
