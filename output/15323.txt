1: In this task, a Physical Therapist Aide is responsible for scheduling patient appointments with physical therapists and coordinating therapists' schedules. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality.

- Direct exposure (E1): The task involves organizing and managing schedules, which could potentially be streamlined with the help of the LLM. The model could assist in generating appointment schedules, sending reminders, and coordinating therapist availability, all of which involve text-based communication and organization. The LLM could automate parts of the scheduling process, saving time and effort.

- Exposure by LLM-powered applications (E2): While the LLM alone can help with text-based tasks related to scheduling, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to further enhance the scheduling process. For example, an application could integrate with calendar systems, automate follow-up communications, or provide data analysis on appointment trends to optimize scheduling efficiency.

- No exposure (E0): If the task requires a high degree of human interaction, precise scheduling based on specific criteria, or real-time adjustments that cannot be effectively automated by the LLM alone, then it would fall under E0.
