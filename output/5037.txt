1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of developing or implementing procedures/systems to evaluate or select suppliers as a Supply Chain Manager, we need to consider the nature of the task and the potential impact of using an LLM.

- This task involves creating or refining processes for supplier evaluation and selection, which requires a deep understanding of supply chain management principles, industry best practices, and potentially specific organizational requirements.
- While an LLM could assist in generating text-based procedures or systems, the task also involves practical considerations, such as assessing supplier capabilities, negotiating contracts, and ensuring compliance with regulations.
- The task may benefit from the LLM's ability to provide insights, suggest innovative approaches, or offer alternative perspectives based on a vast amount of text data it has processed.
- However, the task also involves decision-making that may require human judgment, considering factors beyond text-based information, such as supplier relationships, performance history, and strategic alignment.

Considering these points, the task of developing or implementing procedures/systems to evaluate or select suppliers as a Supply Chain Manager falls under E2 - Exposure by LLM-powered applications. While the LLM can assist in generating text-based content and providing insights, additional software tailored to supply chain management specifics could further enhance the efficiency of completing this task.
