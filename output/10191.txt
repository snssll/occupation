1: In this task, a First-Line Supervisor of Security Workers is required to monitor the behavior of security employees to ensure adherence to quality standards, deadlines, or procedures. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task and how an LLM could assist in completing it. 

- E1: Direct exposure - An LLM could potentially assist in providing guidelines, checklists, or templates for monitoring employee behavior, ensuring adherence to standards, deadlines, or procedures. It could also help in drafting communication to address any issues identified during monitoring.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While an LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time it takes to monitor security employees, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to analyze patterns in employee behavior, provide insights into potential areas of improvement, or generate reports based on the monitoring data.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities would not significantly impact the monitoring of security employees in this context, as the task primarily involves observing and evaluating human behavior rather than analyzing images.
