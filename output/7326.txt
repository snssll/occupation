1: In this task of hiring principal cast members and crew members, a large language model (LLM) could potentially assist by providing templates for job postings, drafting emails to potential candidates, conducting initial screenings based on predefined criteria, and generating interview questions. The LLM could also help in researching potential candidates by summarizing their backgrounds and previous work. However, the task of actually selecting the final candidates based on fit, experience, and other subjective criteria would likely still require human judgment and interaction. While the LLM could streamline some aspects of the hiring process, the final decision-making would likely remain with the human producer or director.

Considering the above analysis, this task falls under E2 exposure. While the LLM could assist in various aspects of the hiring process, it would not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task by at least half. However, it is easy to imagine additional software that could be developed on top of the LLM to further streamline the hiring process, such as automated candidate matching based on specific criteria or analyzing candidate portfolios to suggest potential fits.
