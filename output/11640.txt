1: In this task, a Highway Maintenance Worker is required to perform roadside landscaping work, including clearing weeds and brush, and planting and trimming trees. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves manual labor and physical work, such as clearing weeds and planting trees, which cannot be directly assisted by an LLM.
- The task does not involve complex data analysis, decision-making, or specialized knowledge that would significantly benefit from LLM capabilities.
- While the LLM could potentially provide information on best practices for landscaping or safety guidelines, the task itself does not require the use of an LLM to complete.

Based on these considerations, the task of performing roadside landscaping work for Highway Maintenance Workers would be classified as E0 - No exposure to LLM.
