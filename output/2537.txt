1: In this task, the Hospitalists need to communicate effectively with patients' primary care physicians at various stages to ensure continuity and quality of care. With access to the most powerful OpenAI large language model (LLM), the Hospitalists could potentially use the model to draft detailed and informative messages to the primary care physicians. The LLM could assist in summarizing the patient's current status, treatment plans, changes, and discharge instructions concisely and accurately. The model could also help in generating questions or responses based on the information provided by the primary care physicians. Overall, the LLM could significantly reduce the time required to draft these communications while ensuring that the information is clear and comprehensive.
