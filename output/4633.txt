1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of determining project requirements for Sheet Metal Workers using blueprints, drawings, or instructions, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves interpreting technical information from blueprints and drawings to understand project requirements. The LLM can assist in providing information on general concepts related to sheet metal work, but it may not have the specific domain knowledge required to interpret detailed blueprints accurately. While the LLM can help with general information and possibly provide some guidance, it may not significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task accurately.

Considering the task's reliance on specific technical knowledge and the need for accurate interpretation of detailed blueprints, it is unlikely that the LLM alone can reduce the time it takes to complete the task by at least half. The task involves specialized domain knowledge and practical skills that may not be effectively supported by the LLM's capabilities.
