1: In this task, the Animal Caretaker is responsible for observing and cautioning children while they pet and feed animals in designated areas to ensure the safety of both humans and animals. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves observing and providing guidance based on real-time interactions between children and animals. This task requires physical presence, immediate intervention if needed, and a deep understanding of animal behavior and child safety. While an LLM could potentially provide general guidelines or information on animal behavior, it cannot physically observe or intervene in real-time situations. Therefore, the task does not align with the capabilities of an LLM, and it falls under E0.
