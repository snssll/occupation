1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of installing module array interconnect wiring for Solar Photovoltaic Installers, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can benefit from the use of a large language model (LLM).

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** If the task involves writing detailed instructions, documenting the installation process, or providing feedback on the wiring layout, the LLM could significantly reduce the time needed to complete these text-based tasks. The LLM could assist in generating detailed step-by-step instructions, safety measures, or even troubleshooting tips related to the installation process.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the task itself may not be directly reducible to text-based interactions, there could be potential software applications developed on top of the LLM that could aid in summarizing complex installation manuals, retrieving up-to-date safety guidelines, or even providing recommendations based on the specific installation requirements.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Since the task involves physical installation work, it may not directly benefit from image capabilities unless there are specific diagrams or visual aids that could be processed by the LLM to provide additional guidance or instructions. However, the task description does not explicitly mention the need for detailed visual processing, so the benefit of image capabilities may be limited.
