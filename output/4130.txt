1: In this task of cutting shot sequences to different angles at specific points in scenes, a Film and Video Editor needs to have a deep understanding of visual storytelling, pacing, and continuity. While an LLM could potentially assist in providing general information on editing techniques or principles, it is unlikely to significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task. The task involves a high degree of visual and creative decision-making that requires human judgment and expertise. The LLM may not have the ability to understand the nuances of visual storytelling and editing techniques to the extent needed to perform this task effectively. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not clearly decrease the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete the task with high quality by at least half.
