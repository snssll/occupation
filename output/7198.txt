1: For the task of greeting customers and ascertaining their needs as a Retail Salesperson, the exposure to LLM can be analyzed as follows:

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM could potentially assist in providing scripts or guidelines for greeting customers in a retail setting. It could also help in suggesting questions to ask customers to ascertain their needs effectively. Additionally, it could aid in training materials development for new retail salespersons on how to greet customers and understand their requirements.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time it takes to greet customers and understand their needs, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to create interactive customer service tools. These tools could provide real-time suggestions based on customer responses, analyze customer behavior patterns, or offer personalized recommendations for products based on customer preferences.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities would not significantly impact the task of greeting customers and understanding their needs in a retail setting. This task primarily involves verbal communication and interaction with customers, which does not heavily rely on image processing.
