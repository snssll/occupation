1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of calculating the potential for energy savings as an Energy Auditor, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be completed with the help of an LLM.

- Energy Auditors typically analyze energy usage in buildings, identify inefficiencies, and recommend solutions to reduce energy consumption.
- Calculating the potential for energy savings involves complex calculations based on various factors such as building size, energy usage patterns, types of equipment, insulation levels, and more.
- An LLM could assist in providing information on energy-saving technologies, best practices, and potentially help in performing some calculations based on the data provided.
- However, the task also requires specialized knowledge of energy systems, building structures, and energy efficiency measures, which may not be directly accessible or accurately provided by the LLM alone.
- While the LLM can offer general information and potentially assist in some calculations, the task of calculating energy savings involves domain-specific expertise that goes beyond what the LLM can provide on its own.
