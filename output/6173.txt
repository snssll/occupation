1: In this task of erecting alternate panel, basket weave, and louvered fences as a Fence Erector, the exposure to LLM can be evaluated as follows:

- **E0**: This task involves physical labor and hands-on work that cannot be automated or completed by a language model. The task requires the actual construction of fences, which is not something an LLM can assist with directly.

- **E1**: While an LLM could potentially provide information on how to erect different types of fences, the actual physical work of erecting the fences cannot be done by the LLM. The task involves practical skills and manual labor that are outside the scope of text-based assistance.

- **E2**: It is conceivable that an application could be developed to provide detailed instructions, diagrams, or step-by-step guides on how to erect different types of fences, including alternate panel, basket weave, and louvered fences. This application could leverage the LLM's capabilities to generate detailed instructions or visual aids, but it would not directly perform the physical task.

- **E3**: The task does not involve image processing or detailed visual instructions that would significantly benefit from image capabilities in conjunction with the LLM. The task is more focused on physical construction rather than visual interpretation.
