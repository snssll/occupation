1: In this task, a stonemason is required to remove wedges, fill joints between stones, finish joints between stones, and smooth the mortar to an attractive finish using specific tools like a trowel and a tuck pointer. This task involves physical labor and manual dexterity, which cannot be performed by an LLM or any software tool. The task does not involve text input or output, and the context of stonemasonry is not something that can be captured within 2000 words for the LLM to generate a response. Therefore, this task does not fall under any of the exposure categories (E0, E1, E2, E3) as it cannot be completed or significantly aided by an LLM.

2: E0

3: High
