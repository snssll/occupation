1: In this task, a Penetration Tester is responsible for configuring information systems to incorporate principles of least functionality and least access. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we can break down the task as follows:

- **Configuring information systems**: This involves setting up and adjusting various settings within the information systems to align with the principles of least functionality and least access. The LLM can provide guidance on best practices, examples, and potential configurations based on existing knowledge.

- **Incorporating principles of least functionality and least access**: This requires understanding the concepts of least functionality (limiting the capabilities of systems to reduce vulnerabilities) and least access (restricting user permissions to only what is necessary). The LLM can provide explanations, examples, and recommendations on how to implement these principles effectively.

Based on the nature of the task, the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task by providing detailed guidance, explanations, and examples related to configuring information systems to adhere to the principles of least functionality and least access. The LLM can offer insights, suggestions, and best practices that can streamline the configuration process and ensure that the systems are set up securely.
