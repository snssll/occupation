1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of certifying the eligibility of prospective tenants, following government regulations, we need to consider the level of exposure to LLM. In this task, the main activities involve understanding and applying government regulations related to tenant eligibility. The task does not involve complex data analysis, specialized domain knowledge beyond legal regulations, or the need for image processing capabilities. The task primarily requires interpreting and applying existing rules and guidelines.

Given that the task does not involve complex decision-making, specialized domain knowledge, or the need for image processing, it is unlikely that access to an LLM would significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task. While an LLM could potentially provide information on relevant regulations, the task itself is more about applying those regulations rather than generating new insights or analyses. Therefore, the task is best classified as E0, as access to an LLM would not substantially decrease the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete the task with high quality.
