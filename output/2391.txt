1: In this task, a Remote Sensing Technician is responsible for collecting geospatial data using various technologies. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone or with additional software could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task.

- E0: This task involves physical work and the use of specialized equipment like aerial photography systems, satellites, and detection systems. The task requires hands-on operation of these technologies, which cannot be replaced by the LLM or any software tool.

- E1: While the LLM could potentially assist in providing information or background knowledge related to geospatial data collection techniques, it cannot physically collect data using the mentioned technologies. The task involves practical skills and equipment operation that cannot be directly substituted by the LLM.

- E2: It is conceivable that additional software could be developed to assist Remote Sensing Technicians in analyzing geospatial data, interpreting results, or even automating certain aspects of data collection. This software could leverage the LLM's capabilities to process and analyze large amounts of data efficiently.

- E3: With access to image capabilities, the LLM could potentially assist in analyzing images captured during geospatial data collection. It could help in identifying objects in images, providing captions, or even assisting in image processing tasks related to the data collected.
