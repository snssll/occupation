1: In this task, a Child, Family, and School Social Worker is required to collect supplementary information needed to assist a client, such as employment records, medical records, or school reports. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves gathering specific information from various sources, which can be time-consuming and require searching through multiple documents.
- The task does not involve complex decision-making or precise measurements that would require human judgment.
- The task primarily involves information retrieval and organization, which can be facilitated by the LLM's ability to process and summarize text.
- While the task may benefit from the LLM's ability to assist in writing reports or analyzing the collected information, the core task of collecting supplementary information may not be significantly expedited by the LLM alone.

Based on these considerations, the task falls under E2 - Exposure by LLM-powered applications. While the LLM can assist in processing and analyzing the collected information, additional software tailored to this specific task could further enhance the efficiency of information retrieval and organization.
