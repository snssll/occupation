1: In this task, a Customer Service Representative is required to refer unresolved customer grievances to designated departments for further investigation. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we can break down the task as follows:

- The task involves understanding and interpreting customer complaints, which can be done by an LLM through text input.
- The LLM can generate a response to acknowledge the grievance and inform the customer that their issue will be escalated to the relevant department.
- The LLM can also provide guidance on the appropriate departments based on the nature of the grievance.

Considering the task involves text input and output within the capabilities of the LLM, it falls under E1 as the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality.
