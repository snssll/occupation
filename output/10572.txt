1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of obtaining and recording patient information as a Cardiologist, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves collecting and documenting patient data, which is primarily text-based. The LLM can assist in writing and transforming text, maintaining records of written data, and informing individuals of information via written medium. In this case, the LLM can help in organizing and documenting patient information efficiently.

Given that the task does not involve complex databases, specialized domain knowledge, or detailed image processing, we can rule out E2 and E3. While the task may not be reduced by half in terms of time with the LLM, it can still significantly benefit from the LLM's text processing capabilities, leading to a more efficient and accurate documentation process. Therefore, the task falls under label E1 as the LLM can streamline the process of recording patient information.
