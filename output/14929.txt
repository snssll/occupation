1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of reviewing adverse drug reactions and filing related reports in accordance with regulatory agency guidelines as a Regulatory Affairs Specialist, we need to consider the nature of the task and how LLM exposure could impact its completion:

- This task involves reviewing detailed information about adverse drug reactions and ensuring compliance with regulatory guidelines. The LLM could assist in summarizing complex regulatory documents, providing insights on regulatory requirements, and generating reports based on the information provided.
- The LLM could help in understanding and interpreting regulatory guidelines, potentially reducing the time needed to review and file reports accurately.
- While the LLM may not directly perform the task, it can significantly aid in information retrieval, summarization, and report generation, thereby enhancing the efficiency of the Regulatory Affairs Specialist.

Based on these considerations, the task aligns most closely with E2 - Exposure by LLM-powered applications. Although the LLM alone may not reduce the time to complete the task by half, additional software built on top of the LLM could streamline the process significantly by summarizing documents, providing regulatory insights, and assisting in report generation.
