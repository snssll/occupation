1: In this task, the Online Merchant is required to design the customer interface of an online storefront using web programming or e-commerce software. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves designing a customer interface, which requires creativity, understanding of user experience, and technical skills in web programming or e-commerce software.
- The task does not involve direct text input or output that can be easily automated by an LLM.
- While an LLM could potentially assist with generating text content for the storefront, it is not the primary focus of the task.
- Developing software specifically tailored for designing online storefront interfaces may be possible with LLM-powered applications, but such software would need to integrate visual design elements and user experience considerations, which are beyond the current capabilities of LLMs.

Based on these considerations, the task of designing the customer interface of an online storefront using web programming or e-commerce software is best classified as E0 - No exposure.
