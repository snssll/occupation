1: In this task, a Parking Enforcement Worker is responsible for maintaining equipment and supplies such as hand-held citation computers, citation books, rain gear, tire-marking chalk, and street cones. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if access to the LLM or LLM-powered tools can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality.

- E0: This task involves physical maintenance of equipment and supplies, which cannot be automated by the LLM or any LLM-powered tools. The task requires hands-on work and does not involve text-based information processing that the LLM can assist with.

- E1: The task does not involve writing, transforming text, providing edits, summarizing documents, answering questions, or any other text-based activities that the LLM can directly assist with. Therefore, direct access to the LLM would not reduce the time it takes to complete this task.

- E2: While it is conceivable that specialized software could be developed to track inventory levels, automate equipment maintenance schedules, or provide reminders for replenishing supplies, such software would go beyond the capabilities of the LLM alone. The task does not involve complex data analysis, decision-making based on written information, or highly specialized knowledge retrieval that would benefit from an LLM-powered application.

- E3: The task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images. Therefore, the image capabilities of the LLM are not relevant to this task.
