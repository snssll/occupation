1: In this task, a cardiologist is required to prescribe heart medication to treat or prevent heart problems. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM can assist in completing it. 

- E0: This task involves making medical decisions that require specialized knowledge, expertise, and consideration of individual patient factors. The LLM, even though powerful, cannot replace the expertise and judgment of a cardiologist in prescribing medication tailored to a patient's specific condition, medical history, and other factors. Therefore, the task falls under E0 as it cannot be significantly expedited by the LLM.

- E1: While the LLM can provide general information about heart medications, it cannot replace the nuanced understanding and clinical judgment required in prescribing medication. The task involves complex decision-making based on individual patient assessments, which goes beyond the capabilities of the LLM. Therefore, the task does not fit under E1.

- E2: It is conceivable that software could be developed to assist cardiologists by providing recommendations based on the latest research and guidelines. Such software could potentially analyze patient data and suggest appropriate medications based on established protocols. However, this would require a highly specialized and accurate system that integrates up-to-date medical knowledge with patient-specific data. As of now, such a system is not readily available, so the task does not fall under E2.

- E3: The task of prescribing heart medication does not involve image processing or visual data that would benefit from additional image capabilities. Therefore, the task does not fit under E3.
