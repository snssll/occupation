1: In this task, a Security Manager is responsible for developing, recommending, or managing security procedures for various operations or processes. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves analyzing security procedures, making recommendations, and managing security-related operations. While an LLM could potentially assist in providing general information on security procedures and best practices, the task of developing, recommending, or managing specific security procedures requires specialized knowledge, expertise, and real-time understanding of the organization's security needs. The task also involves decision-making based on complex factors that may not be easily captured by the LLM alone. Therefore, the task falls under E0 as it requires a high degree of human expertise, decision-making, and specialized knowledge that cannot be fully replaced by the LLM.
