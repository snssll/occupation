1: In this task, a Chemistry Teacher, Postsecondary, is required to prepare and deliver lectures to students on various chemistry topics. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves creating lecture content, explaining complex concepts, and delivering information effectively to students. An LLM could potentially assist in generating lecture content, providing explanations, and even suggesting teaching strategies. However, the task also requires practical knowledge of chemistry, pedagogy, and the ability to engage with students effectively, which may not be fully covered by the LLM. While the LLM can provide information and potentially help with content creation, the task also involves interactive elements that may not be easily automated by the LLM alone.
