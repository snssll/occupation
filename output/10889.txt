1: In this task, the occupation involves operating specialized equipment for loading and unloading ships, trucks, and tank cars. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality. The task involves hands-on operation of equipment, which cannot be directly assisted by the LLM. The LLM cannot physically operate machinery or handle materials, so it cannot directly assist in the practical aspects of this task. Therefore, the task does not fall under E1 exposure as it cannot be reduced to writing or transforming text. Additionally, developing software on top of the LLM to operate physical equipment is not feasible, so it does not fit under E2 exposure either. Since the task involves physical operation of equipment that cannot be assisted by the LLM, it does not fall under E3 exposure, which involves image capabilities. Therefore, the task is best classified as E0, as the LLM cannot significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete the task of operating ship loading and unloading equipment.
