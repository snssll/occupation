1: In this task, an embalmer is required to make incisions in arms or thighs, drain blood from the circulatory system, and replace it with embalming fluid using a pump. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves physical actions such as making incisions and using a pump, which cannot be directly performed by an LLM or any software tool. Additionally, the task requires specialized knowledge and skills related to embalming, which may not be within the capabilities of an LLM. As such, this task falls under E0 as it does not involve text input or output that can be processed by an LLM to significantly reduce the time needed to complete the task.
