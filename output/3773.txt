1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of coordinating the look and function of product lines as a Commercial and Industrial Designer, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can benefit from the use of a large language model (LLM).

- E1: Direct exposure - If the task involves writing and transforming text to describe the design elements, providing edits to design specifications, or generating design-related questions, the LLM could significantly reduce the time needed to complete these tasks with equivalent quality by providing suggestions, generating ideas, or assisting in refining design concepts.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While an LLM alone may not reduce the time to complete the task by half, additional software built on top of the LLM could be developed to summarize design documents, retrieve up-to-date design trends, or provide recommendations based on design data. This could enhance the efficiency of the design coordination process.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Since the task of coordinating the look and function of product lines may involve visual elements, having access to image capabilities alongside the LLM could help in creating or editing digital images according to design instructions, which could streamline the design coordination process.
