1: In this task, a Sewing Machine Operator is required to match cloth pieces in the correct sequences before sewing them and verify that dye lots and patterns match. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves visual inspection and matching of cloth pieces based on patterns and dye lots. This task does not involve text input or output, complex instructions, or data retrieval that can be significantly enhanced by an LLM. The task is primarily manual and visual in nature, requiring physical manipulation and assessment of physical objects. Therefore, the task does not align with the capabilities of an LLM or any software built on top of it. As a result, this task falls under E0 as it does not benefit from LLM exposure.

2: E0
