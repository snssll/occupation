1: In this task, a First-Line Supervisor of Gambling Services Workers is required to observe gamblers' behavior for signs of cheating and notify security staff of suspected cheating. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- E0: This task involves direct observation and judgment of human behavior, which requires human interaction and decision-making based on real-time observations. It also involves physical actions such as notifying security staff. The task does not involve text-based inputs or outputs that can be easily processed by an LLM.

- E1: The task does not involve text-based inputs or outputs that can be easily processed by an LLM. It relies heavily on human observation, judgment, and physical actions, which cannot be directly replaced by an LLM.

- E2: While an LLM could potentially assist in generating reports or documenting observations related to suspected cheating incidents, the core task of observing gamblers' behavior for signs of cheating and notifying security staff is primarily based on real-time human observation and judgment. Developing software on top of the LLM to automate this task would be challenging due to the real-time nature of the observations required.

- E3: The task does not involve image processing capabilities that would significantly reduce the time to complete the task. It is primarily based on human observation and interaction.
