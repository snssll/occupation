1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of assessing birthing environments as a midwife, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it. 

- E0: This task involves physically assessing birthing environments, which cannot be done solely through text input and output. The task requires on-site presence and interaction, making it unsuitable for automation using the LLM or any tools built on top of it.
- E1: While the LLM could potentially provide information on best practices for birthing environments, it cannot physically assess cleanliness, safety, or supply availability. Therefore, the LLM alone cannot reduce the time it takes to complete this task by at least half with equivalent quality.
- E2: It is conceivable that additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to provide checklists or guidelines for assessing birthing environments. This software could potentially streamline the process and provide recommendations based on general knowledge. However, the physical assessment aspect would still require human intervention.
- E3: The task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images, so the image capabilities of the LLM are not relevant in this context.

Based on the above analysis, the most appropriate label for this task is E2.

2: E2

3: Moderate
