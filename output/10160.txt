1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of monitoring regulatory or tax law changes as an Investment Fund Manager, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be supported by the capabilities of the LLM.

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** The task involves staying updated on regulatory and tax law changes, which can be a time-consuming process that requires reading and understanding complex legal documents. The LLM can assist by summarizing key points from these documents, providing insights on how changes may impact funds, and even generating reports based on the information provided. This direct access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to monitor and analyze regulatory changes, making it a good fit for E1.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the LLM can provide valuable assistance in summarizing and analyzing text, additional software could be developed to automate the process further. For example, a specialized tool could be created to scan legal documents, extract relevant information, and provide real-time updates on regulatory changes specific to the fund's investments. This additional software could enhance the efficiency of monitoring regulatory changes, but the core task can still be effectively supported by the LLM alone.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Image capabilities are not directly relevant to monitoring regulatory or tax law changes, as the task primarily involves reading and analyzing text-based legal documents. Therefore, image capabilities would not significantly impact the time it takes to complete this task.

Based on the above analysis, the task of monitoring regulatory or tax law changes as an Investment Fund Manager is best classified as **E1 (Direct exposure)**.
