1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of managing wildlife on and around airport grounds as an Airfield Operations Specialist, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be supported by the capabilities of the LLM.

- E0: This task involves hands-on work that requires physical presence and interaction with wildlife on airport grounds. It also involves making real-time decisions based on observations and assessments of the situation, which cannot be effectively replaced by the LLM.

- E1: While the LLM can provide information on wildlife management strategies, regulations, and best practices through text input and output, it cannot directly assist in physically managing wildlife on the airport grounds. The task involves practical, on-the-ground actions that go beyond the capabilities of the LLM.

- E2: It is conceivable that additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to assist Airfield Operations Specialists in managing wildlife more efficiently. This software could potentially analyze data on wildlife behavior, recommend strategies based on historical data, or provide real-time updates on wildlife movements around the airport. However, as of now, the LLM alone does not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task.

- E3: The task of managing wildlife on and around airport grounds does not involve image processing or detailed visual analysis that would benefit from additional image capabilities. Therefore, the task does not fall under this category.
