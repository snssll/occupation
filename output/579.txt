1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of analyzing job requirements and content as an Industrial-Organizational Psychologist, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be impacted by the use of a large language model (LLM).

- E1: Direct exposure - In this task, an LLM could potentially assist in analyzing job requirements and content by providing insights, generating criteria based on existing data, and helping in decision-making processes. The LLM could help in transforming text, providing edits, summarizing documents, and generating questions related to personnel functions. The task involves working with text-based information and making decisions based on that information, which aligns well with the capabilities of an LLM.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the task could benefit from additional software that could summarize longer documents, retrieve up-to-date facts, or provide specialized domain knowledge, the core task of analyzing job requirements and content can still be significantly enhanced by the use of an LLM alone. The LLM can assist in generating criteria, analyzing text-based information, and providing recommendations based on the input data.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not directly relevant to the task of analyzing job requirements and content for personnel functions. The task primarily involves working with text-based information and making decisions based on that content, which does not require image capabilities.

Based on the above analysis, the task of analyzing job requirements and content as an Industrial-Organizational Psychologist is best classified as E1: Direct exposure.
