1: For the task of writing nursing orders as a Clinical Nurse Specialist, the exposure to LLM can be evaluated as follows:

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM can assist in writing and transforming text according to complex instructions, which could include drafting nursing orders based on specific patient needs and medical guidelines. The model can help generate accurate and detailed orders efficiently, potentially reducing the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality by at least half.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While there may not be specific software developed on top of the LLM for this task, it is conceivable that an application could be created to summarize patient information, treatment plans, and medical guidelines to streamline the process of writing nursing orders. This additional software could enhance the efficiency of the task.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not relevant for the task of writing nursing orders, as it primarily involves text-based information related to patient care and medical instructions.
