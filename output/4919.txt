1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of developing instructional materials as an Instructional Coordinator, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves creating lesson plans, handouts, or examinations, which primarily require writing and organizing text. The LLM can assist in generating text, providing feedback on documents, and preparing training materials based on general knowledge. Since the task involves writing and transforming text according to specific instructions, the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality. Therefore, this task falls under the E1 category as direct access to the LLM can expedite the process of developing instructional materials.
