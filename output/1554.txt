1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of "Break out, rig, and stow cargo-handling gear, stationary rigging, or running gear" for Sailors and Marine Oilers, we need to consider how the task can be completed with the help of an LLM. 

- The task involves physical actions such as handling gear, rigging, and stowing cargo, which cannot be directly assisted by an LLM.
- While an LLM could potentially provide written instructions or information related to cargo-handling gear, rigging, and running gear, the actual execution of the task requires physical labor and expertise that an LLM cannot provide.
- The task does not involve text-based activities that can be significantly enhanced by an LLM, such as writing, summarizing documents, providing feedback, or generating questions.

Based on these considerations, the task of "Break out, rig, and stow cargo-handling gear, stationary rigging, or running gear" for Sailors and Marine Oilers would be classified as E0 - No exposure to LLM.
