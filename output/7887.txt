1: In this task, a sheet metal worker is required to inspect individual parts, assemblies, or installations using measuring instruments like calipers, scales, or micrometers. The task involves precise measurements and requires physical interaction with the parts being inspected. The task does not involve text input or output that can be effectively processed by an LLM. Since the task is focused on physical measurements and inspection, it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM, which is more suited for text-based tasks. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not benefit from LLM exposure.

2: E0

3: High
