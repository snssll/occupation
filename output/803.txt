1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of applying for and obtaining all necessary permits or licenses as a Construction Manager, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it.

- E0: This task involves a high degree of human interaction and legal requirements that may not be suitable for automation using the LLM. Additionally, the task may involve specific regulations and requirements that the LLM may not have access to or be able to interpret accurately.

- E1: The LLM could potentially assist in providing guidance on the general process of applying for permits or licenses, drafting written materials such as application forms or cover letters, or even providing information on common requirements. However, the task may involve specific local regulations, codes, or procedures that the LLM may not be able to access or interpret accurately without up-to-date information.

- E2: While the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to provide real-time updates on permit requirements, regulations, and procedures. This software could potentially streamline the application process by retrieving up-to-date information and guiding the Construction Manager through the necessary steps.

- E3: The task of applying for permits or licenses may involve reading text from PDFs or other documents related to regulations and requirements. With access to image capabilities, the LLM could potentially assist in scanning and interpreting documents to extract relevant information more efficiently.
