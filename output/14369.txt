1: In this task, a waiter or waitress is responsible for clearing tables by removing dishes and glasses and taking them to the kitchen for cleaning. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. This task involves physical actions such as picking up dishes and glasses, moving around the restaurant, and interacting with customers. These actions cannot be performed by an LLM or any software tool.
