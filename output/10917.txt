1: In this task, the farmworker is required to operate various types of machinery to perform agricultural activities such as plowing, harrowing, fertilizing, planting, cultivating, spraying, and harvesting crops. These activities involve practical skills, physical coordination, and knowledge of agricultural practices. The task does not involve text-based or image-based information processing that could benefit significantly from the capabilities of an LLM. The task is hands-on and requires direct physical interaction with machinery and crops, which cannot be replaced by text-based processing. Therefore, the task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of an LLM.
