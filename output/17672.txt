1: In this task, a First-Line Supervisor of Non-Retail Sales Workers is required to visit retailers and sales representatives to promote products and gather information. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves interacting with people, physically visiting locations, promoting products, and gathering information. These activities require human interaction, physical presence, and real-time communication skills. While an LLM could potentially assist in preparing for these visits by providing information or drafting communication materials, the core aspects of the task, such as face-to-face interactions and physical presence, cannot be replaced by the LLM. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not significantly benefit from LLM capabilities.
