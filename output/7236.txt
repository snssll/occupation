1: In this task, the Veterinary Assistant or Laboratory Animal Caretaker is responsible for grooming, trimming, or clipping animals' coats. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality. Since grooming, trimming, or clipping animals' coats involves physical interaction with animals and requires practical skills, it is unlikely that the LLM can directly assist in performing these actions. The task does not involve writing, summarizing text, analyzing data, or any other activity that the LLM could easily handle. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM.
