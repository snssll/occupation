1: In this task, an Airfield Operations Specialist is responsible for receiving and posting weather information and flight plan data. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves working with text data related to weather information, flight plans, air routes, and arrival/departure times.
- The task does not require specialized domain knowledge beyond aviation terminology and procedures.
- The task does not involve complex decision-making or analysis beyond receiving and posting the provided information.
- The task does not involve creating or editing digital images, reading text from PDFs, or any other image-related capabilities.

Based on these considerations, the task of receiving and posting weather information and flight plan data aligns most closely with E1 exposure. The task involves working with text data, which can be efficiently handled by an LLM to provide equivalent quality results in a shorter time frame.
