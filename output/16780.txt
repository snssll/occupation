1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of teaching classes and presenting self-help or information sessions related to education and career planning as an Educational, Guidance, and Career Counselor, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. In this task, the LLM could potentially assist in preparing the content for the classes and sessions by providing information, creating presentations, and generating self-help materials. The LLM could also help in summarizing relevant educational and career planning resources for distribution to students. However, the actual teaching and presentation aspects of the task involve human interaction, delivery of information, and engagement with the audience, which are not directly replaceable by the LLM. While the LLM could aid in content creation, the core aspects of teaching and presenting would still require human involvement.
