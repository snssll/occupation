1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of checking the flight performance of new and experimental planes as a Commercial Pilot, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves assessing the performance of aircraft, which requires hands-on experience, technical knowledge, and real-time decision-making skills. While the LLM can provide information on aircraft specifications, regulations, and general aviation knowledge, it lacks the ability to physically interact with the planes or make real-time assessments based on flight data.

Given that the task involves practical, hands-on work that cannot be fully replicated by the LLM, it falls under the category of E0. The LLM cannot replace the expertise and experience required to evaluate the flight performance of new and experimental planes.
