1: In this task, a Bridge and Lock Tender is responsible for performing maintenance duties to keep facilities clean and in order. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM could significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality. Since this task involves physical work such as sweeping, painting, and yard work, it cannot be directly completed using the LLM. The LLM does not have the capability to perform physical tasks or interact with the physical environment. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not meet the criteria for exposure to LLM capabilities.

2: E0

3: High
