1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of cleaning trucks used in the fields for the occupation of Roustabouts, Oil and Gas, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves manual labor and physical interaction with the trucks, which cannot be automated by the LLM. The LLM cannot physically clean the trucks or interact with the equipment in the field. Therefore, the task does not fall under E1, E2, or E3 categories as it does not involve text input or output, image processing, or data analysis that can be significantly aided by the LLM.
