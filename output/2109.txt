1: In this task, the main activities involve physical actions such as cleaning work stations and sweeping floors. These actions cannot be directly performed by an LLM or any software tool. While an LLM could potentially provide guidance on the best practices for cleaning work stations or offer tips on efficient cleaning techniques, the actual physical task of cleaning cannot be automated by the LLM. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not involve any text-based activities that could be significantly expedited by the LLM.
