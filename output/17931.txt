1: For the task of writing original content as a proofreader and copy marker, the exposure to LLM can be evaluated as follows:

- E0: This task involves creativity, understanding of context, and linguistic nuances that may be challenging for an LLM to replicate accurately without human input. The task requires generating original content, which may not be a straightforward process for the LLM to handle effectively.

- E1: While the LLM can assist in generating text and providing suggestions, the task of writing original content, especially for specific purposes like headlines, cutlines, captions, and cover copy, may require human creativity and judgment that the LLM may not fully capture. The LLM can provide ideas and help refine content, but the final output may still heavily rely on human input.

- E2: With further development, specialized software could potentially be created to assist proofreaders and copy markers in generating original content more efficiently. This software could leverage the LLM's capabilities to provide suggestions, refine drafts, and offer creative insights, thereby reducing the time needed for this task.

- E3: The task of writing original content does not directly involve image processing or analysis, so the image capabilities of the LLM would not significantly impact the completion of this task.

Based on the above analysis, the task of writing original content as a proofreader and copy marker is best classified as E2.
