1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of coordinating the installation of a software system as a Software Developer, we need to consider the capabilities of the OpenAI large language model (LLM). 

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM can assist in writing and transforming text and code according to complex instructions, which could include providing guidance on the installation process, troubleshooting steps, or writing documentation for the software system installation. The LLM can also help in summarizing relevant information or providing feedback on installation procedures.
- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time it takes to coordinate the installation of a software system, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to automate certain aspects of the coordination process. This could involve creating tools for tracking installation progress, generating reports, or providing recommendations based on best practices.
- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not relevant for coordinating the installation of a software system, so this label does not apply.

Based on the above considerations, the task of coordinating the installation of a software system as a Software Developer is best classified as E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications.
