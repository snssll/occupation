1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of arranging for installation and testing of products or machinery as a Sales Representative for Technical and Scientific Products, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be aided by the use of an LLM.

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** In this case, the task involves coordinating the installation and testing of technical products, which may require communication with various stakeholders, understanding technical specifications, and ensuring the successful implementation of the products. An LLM could assist in drafting communication messages, summarizing technical information for stakeholders, generating reports or documentation related to the installation process, and providing guidance on common installation and testing procedures. The LLM could also help in drafting emails, preparing training materials, or maintaining records related to the installation process.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task, additional software built on top of the LLM could enhance the process. For example, an application that can retrieve up-to-date technical information about the products being installed, provide recommendations based on data analysis, or offer insights into best practices for installation and testing could streamline the task significantly.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Image capabilities would not have a significant impact on this task as it primarily involves coordinating the installation and testing of products or machinery, which is more text-based and communication-focused rather than reliant on visual information.
