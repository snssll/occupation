1: In this task, an Occupational Therapy Aide is responsible for encouraging patients and attending to their physical needs to help them achieve therapeutic goals. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be significantly aided by the use of the language model. The task involves providing physical care and emotional support to patients, which requires human interaction and physical presence. While the LLM can provide information on therapeutic techniques or guidelines, it cannot replace the hands-on care and support needed in this role. Therefore, the task does not seem to benefit significantly from the use of the LLM in reducing the time it takes to complete the task.
