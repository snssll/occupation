1: In this task, a medical secretary or administrative assistant is responsible for receiving and routing messages or documents, such as laboratory results, to the appropriate staff. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider the complexity of the task and whether the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete it with equivalent quality.

- The task involves receiving and routing messages or documents, which can be straightforward text-based activities.
- The LLM can assist in generating responses, drafting messages, or summarizing information based on the content of the documents.
- The LLM can also help in organizing and categorizing information efficiently.

Considering these points, the task can benefit from the direct access to the LLM through text-based interactions, as the model can assist in processing and managing the messages or documents effectively.
