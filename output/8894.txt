1: In this task, a Printing Press Operator is required to load presses with paper and make necessary adjustments according to paper size. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone or with additional software could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality.

- E1: Direct exposure - The task involves a straightforward physical action of loading presses with paper and making adjustments based on paper size. While the LLM could potentially provide information on paper sizes or adjustments, the physical aspect of the task cannot be directly automated by the LLM. Therefore, direct access to the LLM would not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - It is conceivable that specialized software could be developed on top of the LLM that could assist Printing Press Operators in tasks related to maintenance, troubleshooting, or providing guidance on adjustments based on paper size. This software could potentially reduce the time it takes to complete the task by half by providing real-time recommendations or troubleshooting tips.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities would not significantly impact the task of loading presses with paper and making adjustments based on paper size, as it is primarily a physical and mechanical task that does not rely on image processing.
