1: In this task, a Library Technician is required to conduct reference searches using various resources such as printed materials, in-house databases, and online databases. With the help of an LLM, the technician can potentially streamline the process of searching for information by quickly generating search queries, summarizing search results, and even cross-referencing information from different sources. The LLM can assist in formulating complex search queries, retrieving relevant information from databases, and summarizing the findings. This task involves a significant amount of text-based information retrieval and analysis, which aligns well with the capabilities of the LLM.

Considering the nature of the task and the potential for the LLM to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of conducting reference searches, I would classify this task as E1 - Direct exposure.
