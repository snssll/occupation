1: For the task of developing websites as a computer programmer, the exposure to LLM can be evaluated as follows:

- E1: Direct access to the LLM could potentially reduce the time it takes to complete this task by providing assistance in writing and transforming code, providing edits to existing code, or even generating code snippets based on complex instructions. The LLM could help in tasks like debugging, suggesting improvements, or even generating basic website structures based on given requirements.
- E2: While having access to the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time to complete the task of developing websites, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to streamline certain aspects of web development. This software could potentially assist in tasks like summarizing technical documentation, retrieving up-to-date information for website content, or even providing recommendations based on data analysis for website optimization.
- E3: The task of developing websites does not involve image capabilities, so exposure to LLM with image capabilities would not significantly impact the completion time of this task.

Based on the above analysis, the task of developing websites as a computer programmer aligns best with the E2 label, as having access to the LLM alone may not halve the time to complete the task, but additional software built on top of the LLM could enhance certain aspects of web development.
