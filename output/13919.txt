1: In this task, a Sales Engineer is required to recommend improved materials or machinery to customers, documenting how such changes will lower costs or increase production. To complete this task, the Sales Engineer needs to have a good understanding of the products, materials, and machinery available in the market, as well as the specific needs and requirements of the customers. The Sales Engineer also needs to be able to articulate the benefits of the recommended changes in a clear and convincing manner to the customers.

Using the LLM, the Sales Engineer could potentially generate detailed reports or presentations outlining the benefits of the recommended materials or machinery. The LLM could assist in crafting persuasive arguments and explanations for how the proposed changes would lead to cost savings or increased production. Additionally, the LLM could help in researching and providing up-to-date information on the latest materials and machinery available in the market.

Considering these factors, I would classify this task as E2 - Exposure by LLM-powered applications. While direct access to the LLM alone may not reduce the time it takes to complete the task by at least half, additional software developed on top of the LLM could streamline the process by providing detailed summaries, persuasive arguments, and up-to-date information to support the recommendations made by the Sales Engineer.
