1: In this task, the construction laborer is required to erect or dismantle various temporary structures like scaffolding, shoring, braces, traffic barricades, ramps, etc. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. Erecting or dismantling these structures involves physical labor, spatial awareness, and adherence to safety protocols. While the LLM can provide information on how to erect these structures, it cannot physically perform the task. Additionally, the task involves real-world interactions and physical movements that cannot be replicated by the LLM. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not involve text-based activities that the LLM can significantly assist with.

2: E0

3: High
