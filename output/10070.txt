1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of monitoring menus and spending to ensure meals are prepared economically for the occupation of Cooks, Institution and Cafeteria, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be supported by the capabilities of the LLM.

- The task involves monitoring menus and spending, which primarily requires analyzing data and making decisions based on that analysis.
- The LLM can assist in providing information on cost-effective meal preparation strategies, budgeting tips, and general advice on optimizing menu planning.
- The LLM can also help in generating reports, summaries, or recommendations based on the data provided about menus and spending.
- While the LLM can provide insights and suggestions, the task may involve specific financial data or real-time information that the LLM alone may not be able to access without up-to-date facts.
- The task does not involve complex visual analysis or image processing, so the image capabilities of the LLM are not necessary.

Based on these considerations, the task of monitoring menus and spending to ensure meals are prepared economically for Cooks, Institution and Cafeteria can be classified as E2 - Exposure by LLM-powered applications.
