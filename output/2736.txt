1: In this task, an Audio and Video Technician is responsible for compressing, digitizing, duplicating, and storing audio and video data. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be impacted by the capabilities of the LLM.

- Compressing audio and video data: The LLM could potentially assist in providing information on the latest compression techniques, best practices, or even generate sample code for compression algorithms. This could save time for the technician in researching and implementing compression methods.

- Digitizing audio and video data: The LLM could provide guidance on the latest digitization technologies, standards, and processes. It could also assist in troubleshooting digitization issues or providing recommendations for digitization equipment.

- Duplicating audio and video data: The LLM could help in automating the process of duplicating data, generating scripts for duplication, or providing insights into efficient duplication methods.

- Storing audio and video data: The LLM could assist in recommending storage solutions, best practices for data storage, or even help in organizing and categorizing stored data efficiently.

Considering the potential for the LLM to provide guidance, recommendations, and automation in various aspects of the task, it is likely that this task falls under E2 - Exposure by LLM-powered applications.
