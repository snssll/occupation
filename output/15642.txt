1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of sending out surveys as a Statistical Assistant, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it. 

- E1: Direct exposure - If the task involves writing and sending out surveys, the LLM could assist in drafting the survey questions, formatting the survey, and potentially even sending out the surveys electronically. The LLM could also help in analyzing the survey responses if needed. This would significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not reduce the time it takes to send out surveys by half, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to automate the entire survey process, from drafting to distribution to analysis. This would streamline the task and make it more efficient.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities would not be relevant for the task of sending out surveys as it primarily involves text-based communication.

Considering the above points, the task of sending out surveys as a Statistical Assistant would likely fall under E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications, as additional software could be developed to automate the survey process.
