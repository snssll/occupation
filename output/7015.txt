1: In this task, the orthodontist fits dental appliances in patients' mouths to alter the position and relationship of teeth and jaws or to realign teeth. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if the task can be significantly expedited or improved by using the LLM. The task of fitting dental appliances requires hands-on skills, precision, and direct interaction with patients. The LLM cannot physically perform this task, as it involves manipulating physical objects inside a patient's mouth. Additionally, the task involves realigning teeth, which requires specialized knowledge, training, and expertise that the LLM may not possess. While the LLM could potentially provide information on orthodontic procedures or answer theoretical questions related to orthodontics, it cannot directly assist in fitting dental appliances in patients' mouths.
