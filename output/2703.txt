1: In this task, a Computer, Automated Teller, and Office Machine Repairer is required to complete repair bills, shop records, time cards, or expense reports. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task and how an LLM could assist in completing it. 

- E1: Direct exposure - An LLM could potentially assist in completing repair bills, shop records, time cards, or expense reports by providing templates, generating text based on input data, or even automating some parts of the process. The LLM could help in writing and transforming text according to complex instructions, maintaining records of written data, or preparing training materials based on general knowledge.
  
- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While an LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time to complete these tasks, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to streamline the process further. This software could involve analyzing data to inform decisions, making recommendations based on input data, or even retrieving information from existing knowledge or documents.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities would not significantly impact the completion of repair bills, shop records, time cards, or expense reports as these tasks are primarily text-based and do not involve detailed visual information.
