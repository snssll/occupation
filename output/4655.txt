1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of determining the size and arrangement of illustrative material and copy, as well as selecting the style and size of type for Graphic Designers, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves making design decisions based on visual elements and text, which may not be directly aided by the LLM's text-based capabilities alone. While the LLM could potentially assist in generating text content or providing design suggestions, the task primarily requires visual design expertise that goes beyond the LLM's current capabilities. Therefore, the task does not seem to fit into categories E1, E2, or E3, as it does not involve text-based tasks that the LLM can significantly expedite or tasks that require image capabilities beyond what the LLM can provide.
