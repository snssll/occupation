1: In this task, an Order Clerk is responsible for inspecting outgoing work to ensure it meets customers' specifications. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone or with additional software could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality.

- E1: Direct access to the LLM could potentially help in providing guidelines or checklists for inspecting outgoing work based on general knowledge or standard procedures. The LLM could assist in generating text for inspection reports or communicating with customers about any deviations from specifications.

- E2: While the LLM alone may not reduce the time significantly for this task, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to streamline the inspection process. This software could include features like summarizing customer specifications, retrieving relevant information quickly, or providing recommendations based on past inspection data.

- E3: Image capabilities are not directly relevant to this task as it involves inspecting outgoing work for compliance with specifications, which is primarily text-based.

Based on the considerations above, the task of inspecting outgoing work for compliance with customers' specifications could potentially benefit from additional software developed on top of the LLM to streamline the process, making it more efficient.
