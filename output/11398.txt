1: For the task of performing clerical tasks like typing, filing, and microfilm photography as a teller, the exposure to LLM can be evaluated as follows:

- Typing: The LLM can assist in generating text, editing documents, and providing feedback on written content. It can also help in summarizing documents and answering questions about them. Therefore, the LLM can significantly reduce the time required for typing-related tasks by providing assistance in creating, editing, and organizing text.

- Filing: The LLM can help in organizing and maintaining records of written data. It can also assist in searching for specific information within documents. While it may not directly reduce the time for physical filing tasks, it can streamline the process of digital record-keeping and retrieval.

- Microfilm photography: This task involves capturing images of documents for archival purposes. The LLM does not have image capture capabilities, so it cannot directly assist in microfilm photography. However, it can potentially help in organizing and categorizing digital images of documents.

Considering the above points, the task of performing clerical tasks as a teller can benefit from the LLM's capabilities in typing and filing, but not in microfilm photography.
