1: In this task, the Aircraft Cargo Handling Supervisors need to calculate load weights for different aircraft compartments using charts and computers. With the help of an LLM, the supervisor could potentially automate the process of calculating load weights by inputting the necessary data and receiving the calculated weights as output. The LLM could assist in interpreting the charts and data provided, performing the calculations accurately and efficiently. This task involves text input (data from charts) and text output (calculated load weights), which falls within the capabilities of the LLM. Therefore, this task could be significantly expedited with the assistance of the LLM, reducing the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality.
