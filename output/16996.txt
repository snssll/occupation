1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of testing soils or materials as a Civil Engineer, we need to consider how the task can be impacted by the use of an LLM. In this case, the task involves conducting physical tests on materials to assess their properties, which cannot be directly replaced by text-based interactions with an LLM. While an LLM could potentially provide information on testing procedures or theoretical knowledge related to material properties, it cannot physically conduct the tests required for this task. Therefore, the task does not fall under E1, E2, or E3 categories as it does not involve text-based interactions, specialized knowledge retrieval, or image capabilities that could significantly reduce the time to complete the task.

2: E0

3: High
