1: In this task, a Merchandise Displayer and Window Trimmer is required to collaborate with others to obtain products or other display items. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. This task involves communication, coordination, and collaboration with team members to gather necessary items for display purposes. The task does not involve complex data analysis, specialized domain knowledge, or the need for image capabilities. The task primarily revolves around interpersonal skills and coordination.

Given that the task does not involve complex data processing, specialized knowledge retrieval, or image-related activities, it does not significantly benefit from the capabilities of the LLM or additional software. The task is more focused on human interaction and coordination, which cannot be directly enhanced by the LLM. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as the use of the LLM or LLM-powered tools would not significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete the task.
