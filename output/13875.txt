1: In this task, a Web Administrator is required to recommend website improvements and develop budgets to support those recommendations. To complete this task, the Web Administrator would need to have a good understanding of web development, user experience, and budgeting. The LLM could assist in generating ideas for website improvements based on current trends, user preferences, and best practices in web design. It could also help in creating budget proposals by providing cost estimates for different web development activities. However, the LLM alone may not be able to access specific financial data or company budgets to provide accurate budget recommendations. Therefore, while the LLM can provide some support in generating ideas and estimates, additional software that integrates financial data and company-specific information would be needed to fully automate the budget development process.
