1: In this task, a Structural Metal Fabricator and Fitter is required to straighten warped or bent parts using various tools like sledges, hand torches, straightening presses, or bulldozers. This task involves physical manipulation of metal parts and requires hands-on skills and experience to ensure the parts are straightened correctly. Since this task involves physical work and precise measurements, it cannot be effectively completed using an LLM or any software tool based on it. The LLM does not have the capability to physically manipulate objects or perform tasks that require hands-on work. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not benefit from exposure to the LLM.
