1: In this task, the Correctional Officers and Jailers are required to search for and recapture escapees. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. Searching for and recapturing escapees involves physical actions such as tracking, surveillance, and potentially engaging in confrontations. These actions cannot be performed by an LLM or any software tool. The task also requires real-time decision-making, physical agility, and the ability to assess and respond to dynamic situations, which are beyond the capabilities of an LLM. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it involves physical actions and real-time decision-making that cannot be automated by an LLM.
