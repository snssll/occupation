1: In this task, a veterinary technologist or technician is required to administer emergency first aid to animals, which may involve performing emergency resuscitation or other life-saving procedures. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it. 

- E0: This task involves hands-on, practical skills such as performing emergency resuscitation, which cannot be effectively replaced by the LLM. The LLM does not have physical capabilities to perform life-saving procedures, and this task requires immediate action and decision-making based on real-time observations, making it unsuitable for automation by the LLM.
