1: In this task, a firefighter is required to salvage property by removing broken glass, pumping out water, and ventilating buildings to remove smoke. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be completed with the help of an LLM.

- The task involves physical actions such as removing broken glass and pumping out water, which cannot be directly assisted by an LLM.
- Ventilating buildings to remove smoke requires practical knowledge and skills that cannot be substituted by text-based assistance from an LLM.
- The task does not involve complex data analysis, decision-making based on data, or specialized knowledge retrieval that would benefit significantly from an LLM.

Based on these considerations, it is clear that the task of salvaging property as described for firefighters falls under E0 as it does not involve activities that can be significantly expedited or improved by the use of an LLM.
