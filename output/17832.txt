1: For the task of wrapping, labeling, or dating food items for sale as a barista, the exposure to LLM can be evaluated as follows:

- E0: This task involves physical actions such as wrapping and labeling food items, which cannot be automated by an LLM or any software tool. It also requires manual dexterity and handling of physical objects, making it unsuitable for automation by text-based models like LLM.

- E1: While an LLM could potentially provide guidance on how to wrap, label, or date food items through text instructions, the actual physical task of doing so cannot be completed by the LLM itself. Therefore, the time it takes to complete this task would not be significantly reduced by using an LLM.

- E2: It is difficult to imagine additional software that could be developed on top of the LLM to automate the physical act of wrapping, labeling, or dating food items. This task is straightforward and does not involve complex decision-making or specialized knowledge that would benefit from LLM-powered applications.

- E3: The task of wrapping, labeling, or dating food items does not involve image capabilities that would significantly impact the time it takes to complete the task. The task is primarily text-based and manual in nature, making image capabilities irrelevant in this context.
