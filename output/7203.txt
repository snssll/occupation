1: In this task of greeting customers and opening their car doors, there is no direct involvement of text input or output that would benefit from the use of a large language model (LLM). The task is physical in nature and involves human interaction, which cannot be automated by an LLM. Therefore, there is no way for the LLM to significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with high quality. As such, this task falls under E0 as it does not benefit from LLM capabilities.
