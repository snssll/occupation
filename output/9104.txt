1: In this task, a Sales Representative is required to maintain customer records using automated systems. With the help of the LLM, the representative can potentially automate the process of updating and organizing customer information. The LLM can assist in generating templates for record-keeping, summarizing customer interactions for easy reference, and even providing insights based on the data input. This task involves text input and output, which falls within the capabilities of the LLM. While the task may not require complex decision-making, it can benefit from the LLM's ability to process and generate text efficiently.

Considering the nature of the task and the potential for the LLM to streamline the record-keeping process significantly, I would classify this task as E1 - Direct exposure.
