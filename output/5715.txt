1: In this task, a First-Line Supervisor of Office and Administrative Support Workers is required to discuss work problems or grievances with union representatives. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM can assist in completing it. 

- E0: This task involves human interaction and negotiation skills that are not easily replaceable by the LLM. The nuances of discussing work problems or grievances with union representatives require emotional intelligence, understanding of labor laws, and interpersonal skills that are beyond the capabilities of the LLM.

- E1: While the LLM can provide general information on labor laws or sample scripts for communication, it cannot actively engage in discussions with union representatives on behalf of the supervisor. The task involves real-time interaction, negotiation, and decision-making that are best handled by a human supervisor.

- E2: It is challenging to imagine additional software that could be developed on top of the LLM to significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task. The complexity of union negotiations and the need for human judgment make it unlikely that software alone could handle this task effectively.

- E3: Image capabilities are not relevant for this task as it does not involve image processing or analysis.

2: E0

3: High
