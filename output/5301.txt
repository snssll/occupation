1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of devising ways to expand congregational membership as a clergy member, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves generating creative ideas and strategies to attract more members to a congregation. The LLM can assist by providing insights, suggestions, and potential approaches based on existing knowledge and trends in religious communities. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM can help in brainstorming and generating ideas for expanding congregational membership by providing creative suggestions and strategies based on the input provided. It can offer a wide range of perspectives and potential solutions to consider, ultimately reducing the time and effort required to come up with innovative approaches.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone can provide valuable insights and suggestions, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to further enhance the process. This software could potentially analyze data on congregation demographics, trends in religious practices, and successful membership expansion strategies to offer more tailored recommendations and actionable insights.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not relevant to the task of expanding congregational membership as it primarily involves text-based input and strategic planning rather than visual content.

Based on the above analysis, the task of devising ways to expand congregational membership as a clergy member is best classified as E1: Direct exposure.
