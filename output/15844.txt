1: In this task, a barista is responsible for setting up or restocking product displays in a coffee shop. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it. 

- E0: This task involves physical actions such as arranging products in a display, which cannot be directly assisted by the LLM or any software tools associated with it. The task also does not involve complex decision-making or specialized knowledge that the LLM could provide.

- E1: While the LLM could potentially provide written instructions on how to set up or restock product displays, the actual physical action of arranging the products cannot be automated or significantly assisted by the LLM. Therefore, the time saved by using the LLM for this task would not be substantial.

- E2: It is conceivable that a specialized software application could be developed on top of the LLM that could assist in generating creative display ideas or providing recommendations for product placement based on customer preferences. However, such a tool would still not be able to physically set up or restock product displays, limiting the potential time savings.

- E3: The task of setting up or restocking product displays does not involve image processing or detailed visual analysis that would benefit from additional image capabilities. Therefore, this task does not fall under E3.

2: E0

3: High
