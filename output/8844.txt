1: In this task, an Aircraft Mechanic and Service Technician listens to operating engines to detect and diagnose malfunctions. To complete this task, the technician relies on auditory cues to identify issues with the engine. The task does not involve any written or spoken text, and the information is purely auditory. Since the task does not involve text input or output, the LLM, which is a text-based model, would not be directly applicable in this scenario. The LLM cannot listen to engine sounds or diagnose malfunctions based on auditory cues alone. Therefore, this task does not fall under E1, E2, or E3 exposure categories.
