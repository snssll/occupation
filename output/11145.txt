1: In this task, the Food Preparation Worker is responsible for packaging take-out foods or serving food to customers. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality. 

Food packaging and serving involve physical actions such as handling food, interacting with customers, and managing orders in a fast-paced environment. These actions cannot be directly replaced by text-based interactions with the LLM. While the LLM could potentially provide guidance on food safety regulations, customer service tips, or menu suggestions, the core tasks of packaging and serving food require physical presence and actions that the LLM cannot perform.
