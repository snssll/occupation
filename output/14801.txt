1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of researching technical requirements or environmental impacts of urban green spaces, such as green roof installations, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves gathering information on specific technical aspects and environmental impacts related to urban green spaces, which may require accessing specialized domain knowledge and up-to-date facts. The LLM can assist in providing general information on these topics, but it may not have access to the most current data unless it is explicitly provided in the input. Additionally, the task may benefit from the ability to summarize longer documents or retrieve specialized domain knowledge, which could be developed into software applications on top of the LLM. However, the task does not involve image processing or detailed visual analysis, so the image capabilities of the LLM are not directly relevant.
