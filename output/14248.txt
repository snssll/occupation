1: In this task, a school psychologist is required to refer students and their families to appropriate community agencies for various services. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality. 

- The task involves understanding the needs of students and their families, assessing the available community agencies, and making appropriate referrals. 
- The LLM can assist in providing information about different community agencies, their services, and possibly even guidelines on making appropriate referrals.
- The LLM can help generate referral letters or communication to the agencies based on the information provided.
- However, the task also requires a level of human judgment, empathy, and understanding of individual circumstances which the LLM may not be able to fully comprehend.

Considering these points, the task can benefit from the LLM's assistance in providing information and generating communication but may still require human judgment and empathy, placing it in the E2 category.
