1: In this task, a Lighting Technician is responsible for installing color effects or image patterns onto lighting fixtures. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the complexity of the task and whether the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete it with equivalent quality.

- The task involves physical work that requires manual dexterity and knowledge of lighting equipment, which cannot be directly assisted by the LLM.
- The task does not involve complex decision-making or specialized domain knowledge that would benefit significantly from LLM capabilities.
- While the LLM could potentially provide information on different color effects or image patterns, the actual installation process is hands-on and practical, not text-based.

Based on these considerations, it is unlikely that the LLM can reduce the time it takes to complete this task significantly. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not benefit from LLM exposure.
