1: Special Education Teachers, Middle School, often collaborate with other teachers to ensure that special education students receive the necessary support. To determine the exposure label for this task, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality. In this case, the task involves communication, collaboration, and coordination with other teachers, which are primarily interpersonal skills that cannot be directly replaced by the LLM. While the LLM can provide information and resources related to special education, it cannot replace the need for direct collaboration and communication between teachers. Therefore, the task does not fall under E1, as it cannot be directly transformed or completed solely by the LLM. Additionally, developing software on top of the LLM to handle the interpersonal aspects of collaboration would be complex and may not significantly reduce the time needed to complete the task. As a result, the task does not fit under E2 either. Since the task does not involve image capabilities, it also does not fall under E3. Therefore, the most appropriate label for this task is E0.

2: E0

3: High
