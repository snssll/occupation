1: In this task, a middle school teacher is required to establish clear objectives for lessons, units, and projects, and communicate these objectives to students. To complete this task, the teacher needs to have a good understanding of the subject matter, the curriculum, and the students' needs. The teacher must be able to articulate these objectives clearly and effectively to ensure that students understand what is expected of them. 

Using the LLM, the teacher could potentially get assistance in formulating clear and concise objectives based on the subject matter and student requirements. The LLM could help generate different examples of objectives, provide insights into effective communication strategies, and offer suggestions on how to tailor objectives to different learning styles. However, the task also requires a deep understanding of the specific context of the classroom, the students, and the curriculum, which the LLM may not be able to fully grasp without up-to-date information.

Considering these points, the task of establishing clear objectives for lessons and communicating them to students could benefit from the LLM's assistance in generating ideas and providing guidance on effective communication. However, the task still heavily relies on the teacher's expertise and contextual knowledge, making it a task that falls under E2 - Exposure by LLM-powered applications.
