1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of providing crisis intervention to students as an Educational, Guidance, and Career Counselor, we need to consider the nature of the task. This task involves offering immediate support and guidance to students facing challenging situations at school. While an LLM could potentially provide general information on crisis intervention techniques or strategies, the task itself requires a high level of human interaction, empathy, and real-time decision-making based on individual student needs and circumstances. The task also involves emotional intelligence, active listening, and personalized support, which are not areas where an LLM can currently provide significant assistance. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it requires a high degree of human interaction and cannot be effectively automated by an LLM.
