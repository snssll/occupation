1: In this task, the main activity is attaching electrodes to patients using adhesives. This task involves physical interaction with patients, which cannot be replaced by an LLM or any software tool. The task requires manual dexterity, precision, and adherence to safety protocols to ensure the electrodes are properly attached. Since the task involves hands-on work and direct interaction with patients, it falls under the category of tasks that cannot be significantly aided by an LLM or any software tool. Therefore, this task would be classified as E0 as it does not benefit from exposure to the LLM.
