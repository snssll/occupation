1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of identifying and characterizing specific causes or sources of water pollution as a Water Resource Specialist, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves analyzing and understanding complex environmental data related to water pollution, which may require expertise in environmental science and water management.

- E0: This task involves specialized domain knowledge in environmental science and water management, which may not be easily accessible or accurately represented by the LLM alone. The task also requires practical experience and fieldwork, which cannot be replicated by the LLM.

- E1: While the LLM can provide general information on water pollution causes based on existing data and research, it may not have access to the most up-to-date information or specialized domain knowledge required for this task. The task also involves practical fieldwork and data collection, which the LLM cannot perform.

- E2: With the development of additional software that can retrieve and analyze large datasets on water pollution, the LLM could potentially assist in summarizing and synthesizing information to identify trends and patterns in water pollution causes. However, the task still requires specialized domain knowledge and practical experience that the LLM alone may not possess.

- E3: The task does not involve image capabilities, so exposure to LLM and image capabilities would not significantly impact the completion of this task.

Based on the above analysis, the most appropriate label for this task is E2.

2: E2

3: Moderate
