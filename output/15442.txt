1: In this task, the operating engineer is required to select and fasten bulldozer blades or other attachments to tractors using hitches. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. This task involves physical manipulation of equipment, specifically attaching blades to tractors. It does not involve text input or output, complex instructions, data analysis, or any other activity that can be directly assisted by an LLM. The task requires hands-on work and expertise in operating heavy machinery, which cannot be substituted by the capabilities of an LLM. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM or any tools built on top of it.
