1: Special Education Teachers, whether in middle school or high school, often have to provide assistive devices, supportive technology, and assistance accessing facilities to students with disabilities. This task involves understanding the specific needs of each student, selecting appropriate assistive devices or technology, and ensuring that students can access facilities comfortably and safely. While the task does involve some level of decision-making and understanding of individual student needs, it primarily revolves around providing support and assistance based on established guidelines and protocols. The task does not require highly specialized domain knowledge beyond what a Special Education Teacher would typically possess. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not significantly benefit from the capabilities of an LLM.
