1: In this task, a fundraiser is responsible for recruiting sponsors, participants, or volunteers for fundraising events. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves reaching out to potential sponsors, participants, or volunteers, which requires communication skills, persuasion, and networking. While an LLM could potentially assist in drafting outreach messages or providing suggestions for recruitment strategies, the core of the task involves human interaction, relationship-building, and negotiation, which are not areas where the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not clearly decrease the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete the task with high quality by at least half.
