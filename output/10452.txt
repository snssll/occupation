1: In this task, a coroner is required to observe and record the positions and conditions of bodies and related evidence. This task involves documenting physical details and observations accurately. While an LLM could potentially assist in generating reports or summaries based on the recorded information, it cannot physically observe or interact with the bodies and evidence. The task also does not involve text input/output or data analysis that the LLM could significantly expedite. Therefore, the task of observing and recording the positions and conditions of bodies and related evidence falls under E0 as it does not clearly benefit from LLM capabilities.
