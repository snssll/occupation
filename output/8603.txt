1: In this task, a New Accounts Clerk is responsible for issuing safe-deposit keys to customers and admitting them to vaults. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the complexity of the task and whether the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete it with equivalent quality.

- The task involves physical actions such as issuing keys and admitting customers to vaults, which cannot be directly performed by the LLM.
- The task does not involve complex decision-making or specialized knowledge that would require the LLM's capabilities.
- The task is more operational and procedural in nature, focusing on customer service and security protocols.

Based on these considerations, the task does not align with any of the exposure labels provided. The LLM cannot directly perform the physical actions required for this task, and the task does not involve the type of information processing or decision-making that would benefit significantly from LLM capabilities.
