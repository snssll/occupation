1: In this task, a Brownfield Redevelopment Specialist or Site Manager is responsible for preparing and submitting permit applications for various projects. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves a significant amount of writing and documentation, which can be effectively supported by an LLM. The LLM can assist in drafting the permit applications, ensuring they are comprehensive, accurate, and meet all necessary requirements. The model can also provide guidance on the specific information needed for each type of permit application, helping the specialist or manager streamline the process.

Given that the task primarily involves writing and transforming text according to specific instructions, the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality. The model can generate content, provide suggestions, and ensure that the permit applications are well-crafted. Therefore, this task falls under the E1 label as direct access to the LLM can expedite the completion of the task by at least half.
