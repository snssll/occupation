1: In this task, the occupation involves setting up forms and laying out guidelines for curbs according to written specifications. The task requires following specific instructions and guidelines to ensure the curbs are constructed correctly. With access to the powerful OpenAI large language model (LLM), the task can be completed more efficiently by generating detailed written instructions, providing guidance on the best practices for setting up forms and laying out guidelines, and offering alternative methods or materials based on the specifications provided. The LLM can also assist in troubleshooting any issues that may arise during the process, thereby enhancing the overall efficiency and accuracy of the task.

Considering the nature of the task and the potential for the LLM to provide detailed written instructions, guidance, and troubleshooting assistance, I would classify this task as E1 - Direct exposure.
