1: In this task of overseeing subject enrollment to ensure proper informed consent, an LLM could potentially assist in providing guidance on best practices for obtaining informed consent, drafting informed consent documents, and ensuring documentation is thorough and accurate. The LLM could also help in generating templates for informed consent forms based on regulations and guidelines. However, since this task involves a high level of human interaction, legal implications, and ethical considerations, it is unlikely that the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced clinical research coordinator to complete the task with high quality. The nuances of obtaining informed consent, ensuring comprehension, and addressing individual subject needs require human judgment and empathy, which an LLM may not fully capture.
