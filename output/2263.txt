1: In this task, a Survey Researcher collaborates with other researchers in planning, implementing, and evaluating surveys. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves collaborating with other researchers, which requires communication, coordination, and expertise in survey research methodologies. While an LLM could potentially assist in generating survey questions or providing background information on survey methodologies, the core aspect of collaboration with other researchers involves human interaction, decision-making, and specialized knowledge that may not be easily replaced by an LLM. The task also does not involve specific technical requirements that would benefit significantly from LLM capabilities beyond general text processing.
