1: In this task, a Surveying and Mapping Technician is required to compare topographical features or contour lines with images from aerial photographs, old maps, or other reference materials to verify their accuracy. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves analyzing and comparing visual data (images, maps, photographs) to verify accuracy. While the LLM can assist with text-based tasks, it does not have the capability to view, analyze, or compare images directly. Therefore, the task does not fall under E1, E2, or E3 categories as the LLM alone cannot significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task.
