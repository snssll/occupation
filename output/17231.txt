1: In this task, an Animal Caretaker is responsible for transferring animals between enclosures for various purposes. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone or with additional software could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality.

- E0: This task involves physical interaction with animals and enclosures, which cannot be replaced by text-based tools like the LLM. The task also requires hands-on skills and knowledge of animal behavior, which cannot be effectively replicated by the LLM.

- E1: While the LLM could potentially provide information on best practices for transferring animals between enclosures, the actual physical task cannot be completed using text-based tools alone. The nuances of handling different species, ensuring safety, and responding to unexpected behaviors require practical experience and physical presence.

- E2: It is challenging to imagine additional software built on top of the LLM that could automate the physical task of transferring animals between enclosures. While the LLM could potentially provide theoretical knowledge or guidelines, the practical aspect of handling live animals in real-time is beyond the capabilities of text-based tools.

- E3: The task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images, so the image capabilities of the LLM would not significantly impact the completion of this task.
