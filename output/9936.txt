1: In this task, the coach or scout is responsible for monitoring athletes' use of equipment to ensure safe and proper use. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone or with additional software could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality.

- E0: This task involves physical monitoring and observation of athletes using equipment, which cannot be replaced by text-based tools like the LLM. The task also requires real-time assessment and intervention, which is not something the LLM can provide.

- E1: The LLM could potentially assist in creating training materials or guidelines related to equipment safety and proper use. It could also help in documenting observations and providing feedback to athletes. However, the real-time monitoring aspect of ensuring safe and proper use of equipment would still require human intervention and physical presence.

- E2: While the LLM could be used to generate training materials or guidelines, additional software could potentially be developed to provide virtual simulations or interactive modules for athletes to practice safe equipment use. This software could enhance the training process and provide more interactive learning experiences.

- E3: The task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images, so the image capabilities of the LLM are not directly relevant to this task.

2: E0
