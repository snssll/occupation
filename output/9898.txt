1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of monitoring and analyzing data from processes and experiments as a Chemical Engineer, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves working with data, which can be text-based and does not require precise measurements or detailed visuals. The LLM can assist in analyzing written information to inform decisions, which aligns with its capabilities. Chemical Engineers often deal with complex data sets and require analytical skills, which the LLM can support by providing insights and recommendations based on the data provided. Therefore, this task falls under the E1 category as the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to analyze and interpret data, providing valuable insights and recommendations.

2: E1

3: Moderate
