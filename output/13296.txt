1: In this task, an Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeon is required to provide emergency treatment for facial injuries, including lacerations and fractured bones. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. Given that this task involves hands-on medical treatment that requires physical examination, assessment, and intervention, it falls under the category of tasks that cannot be effectively completed by an LLM or any software tool. The task involves immediate and critical decision-making based on physical examination and medical expertise, which cannot be replaced by text-based AI models. Therefore, this task would be classified as E0 as it does not benefit from LLM exposure.

2: E0
