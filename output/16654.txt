1: In this task, a Security Manager is responsible for supporting efforts to reduce substance abuse or other illegal activities in the workplace. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be completed with the help of an LLM. 

- The task involves understanding and implementing strategies to address substance abuse and illegal activities in the workplace, which may require knowledge of policies, procedures, and legal implications.
- The LLM can assist in providing information on best practices, legal guidelines, and strategies to address such issues through text input and output.
- The LLM can help in generating policies, procedures, and guidelines related to substance abuse and illegal activities in the workplace.
- It can also assist in drafting communication materials, training modules, or reports related to these efforts.

Based on these considerations, the task can be completed more efficiently with the assistance of the LLM, as it can provide relevant information, generate documents, and support decision-making processes related to reducing substance abuse and illegal activities in the workplace.
