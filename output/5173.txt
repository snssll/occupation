1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of developing software applications or programming for statistical modeling and graphic analysis as a Statistician, we need to consider the level of exposure to LLM.

- E1: Direct exposure - In this task, a Statistician would likely benefit from direct access to the LLM to assist in writing and transforming code for statistical modeling and graphic analysis. The LLM could help generate code snippets, provide explanations, or offer suggestions for improving the software applications. This direct access could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While having access to the LLM alone may not reduce the time by half for this task, it is easy to imagine additional software developed on top of the LLM that could enhance the Statistician's workflow. This software could provide automated code generation, suggest statistical models, or offer insights for graphic analysis, thereby streamlining the development process.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities would not be directly relevant to the task of developing software applications or programming for statistical modeling and graphic analysis. Therefore, this task does not fall under E3.

Based on the considerations above, the most fitting label for this task would be E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications.

2: E2

3: Moderate
