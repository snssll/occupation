1: In this task, an interpreter or translator reads written materials and rewrites them into specified languages. With the help of a large language model (LLM), the process of translating written materials can be significantly expedited. The LLM can assist in translating complex legal documents, scientific works, or news reports accurately and efficiently. The model can provide suggestions, improve the flow of the translated text, and ensure that the content is accurately conveyed in the specified language. Overall, the LLM can streamline the translation process and reduce the time required to complete the task.

Considering the nature of the task and the capabilities of the LLM in translating text between languages, it is evident that direct access to the LLM can greatly enhance the efficiency and accuracy of the translation process. Therefore, this task falls under the category of E1 - Direct exposure.
