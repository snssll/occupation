1: In this task, a Fine Artist is required to brush or spray protective or decorative finishes on various items such as background panels, informational legends, exhibit accessories, or finished paintings. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. This task involves physical work that cannot be directly performed by an LLM. The application of protective or decorative finishes requires manual dexterity and artistic skill, which are not capabilities of the LLM. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not involve text-based work that can be significantly aided by the LLM.

2: E0
