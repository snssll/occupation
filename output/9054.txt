1: In this task, an Advertising Sales Agent is responsible for maintaining existing client accounts while also acquiring new clients. To complete this task, the agent would need to communicate effectively with clients, understand their needs, negotiate deals, and potentially create proposals or presentations to pitch to new clients. The task involves a significant amount of written communication, record-keeping, and potentially generating sales materials.

Considering the nature of the task, an LLM could assist in various aspects:
- Writing and responding to emails with clients.
- Maintaining records of client interactions and account details.
- Generating sales proposals or presentations.
- Providing feedback on sales materials.
- Summarizing client information for quick reference.

Given that the LLM can help with these subtasks and reduce the time it takes to complete them, I would classify this task as E1.

2: E1

3: Moderate
