1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of investigating facts and law of cases as a Paralegal or Legal Assistant, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves researching and analyzing legal information from various sources to prepare cases. The LLM can assist in this task by providing access to a vast amount of text data, legal documents, and resources to aid in the research process. The LLM can help in summarizing legal documents, answering questions related to legal matters, and providing insights based on the information provided. However, the task also requires understanding complex legal concepts, applying them to specific cases, and making judgments based on the gathered information, which may go beyond the capabilities of the LLM alone. While the LLM can provide valuable assistance in information retrieval and analysis, the task also involves critical thinking and legal expertise that may not be fully covered by the model.
