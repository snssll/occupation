1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of providing logistics technology or information as a Logistics Engineer, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be impacted by the use of the OpenAI large language model (LLM).

- E1: Direct exposure - The task involves providing logistics technology or information, which can be done through writing and transforming text to convey the necessary details. The LLM can assist in generating detailed explanations, recommendations, or summaries related to logistics technology, which can significantly reduce the time needed to compile and communicate this information effectively.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not reduce the time to complete the task by half, additional software built on top of the LLM could enhance the capabilities for summarizing complex logistics data, retrieving up-to-date information, or making recommendations based on data analysis. Such software could streamline the process of providing logistics technology or information.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not directly relevant to the task of providing logistics technology or information, as it primarily involves text-based communication of logistics details rather than visual content.

Based on the above analysis, the task of providing logistics technology or information as a Logistics Engineer aligns most closely with E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications.
