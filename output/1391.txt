1: In this task, a Bus and Truck Mechanic and Diesel Engine Specialist is required to attach test instruments to equipment and read dials and gauges to diagnose malfunctions. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if the task can be significantly expedited or improved by using the LLM. Since this task involves physical interaction with equipment, precise measurements, and hands-on diagnostic work, it does not seem suitable for automation or assistance from an LLM. The LLM cannot physically attach test instruments or read dials and gauges in the real world, so it cannot directly assist in this task.
