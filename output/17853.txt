1: In this task, the appraiser needs to write and submit appraisal reports for various types of property. This task involves a significant amount of text generation and organization to convey detailed information about the appraised items. An LLM could assist by providing templates, suggesting relevant information to include, helping with language refinement, and ensuring the reports are comprehensive and well-structured. The LLM can also assist in generating descriptions of the items being appraised based on input data. However, the task also requires domain-specific knowledge about appraising different types of property accurately, which the LLM may not have on its own. While the LLM can aid in the writing process, it may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task due to the need for specialized expertise in property appraisal.
