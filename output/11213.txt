1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of "Participate in internal or external audits" for Regulatory Affairs Specialists in terms of exposure to LLM, we need to consider the nature of the task. This task involves being present during audits to ensure compliance with regulations and standards. While the LLM could potentially assist in preparing documentation or providing information related to regulations, the actual participation in audits requires human interaction, understanding of complex regulatory frameworks, and real-time decision-making based on the audit findings. The LLM cannot directly participate in audits or interact with auditors in a meaningful way, as it lacks the ability to physically attend audits or engage in real-time discussions.
