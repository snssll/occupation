1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of assessing potential solar installation sites, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves analyzing various factors such as site location, orientation, shading, and energy production potential. The LLM can assist in providing information on solar energy principles, best practices for site assessment, and general guidelines for feasibility studies. It can also help generate reports based on input data and provide recommendations for design requirements. However, the task may require specific technical knowledge related to solar energy systems and site assessment, which the LLM may not possess. Therefore, while the LLM can provide general information and support in the analysis process, it may not significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete the task with high quality.
