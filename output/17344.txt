1: For the task of trimming and compressing finished forgings to specified tolerances, the process involves physical manipulation of metal or plastic components to meet specific requirements. This task requires hands-on work and precise measurements to ensure the final product meets the desired specifications. Since this task involves physical actions and precise measurements, it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM or any tools built on top of it. The LLM cannot perform physical tasks or provide real-time feedback on physical objects. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not benefit from the use of the LLM or related tools.
