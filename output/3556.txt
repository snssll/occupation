1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of contacting customers to collect payments on delinquent accounts as a Credit Analyst, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. In this task, the Credit Analyst would typically need to communicate with customers, understand payment statuses, negotiate payment plans, and follow up on payment arrangements. The LLM could potentially assist in drafting communication templates, providing guidance on negotiation strategies, or suggesting language for follow-up emails. However, the task also involves a significant human interaction component, as it requires building rapport with customers, understanding individual circumstances, and making judgment calls based on the responses received. While the LLM could provide some support in the form of text generation, it cannot fully replace the nuanced human interaction needed in debt collection. Therefore, the task does not fit neatly into the categories of E1, E2, or E3.

2: E0

3: Moderate
