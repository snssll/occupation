1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of obtaining county land values and sales information about nearby properties to aid in the establishment of property values for Appraisers and Assessors of Real Estate, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. In this task, the LLM can assist by providing information on general real estate appraisal practices, guidelines, and methodologies. It can also help in generating sample queries to search for county land values and sales information. However, the LLM itself may not have direct access to up-to-date county-specific data unless it is provided in the input. Therefore, the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time it takes to gather specific county land values and sales information, as this data may require real-time updates and access to external databases beyond the LLM's capabilities. While additional software could potentially be developed to integrate with the LLM for data retrieval, the current limitations of the LLM in accessing real-time data may hinder its effectiveness in this specific task.
