1: To determine the appropriate label for the task "Serve on committees" for Political Scientists, we need to consider how the task can be completed with the help of an LLM. 

- E0: This task involves human interaction and decision-making that cannot be automated by an LLM. Serving on committees requires active participation, discussion, and decision-making based on complex human interactions and dynamics. An LLM cannot replace the nuanced understanding and judgment required for this task.

- E1: While an LLM can provide information, summaries, or insights related to political science topics that may inform the work of Political Scientists serving on committees, it cannot actively participate in the committee meetings or discussions. The task of serving on committees involves real-time interactions, negotiations, and decision-making that go beyond the capabilities of an LLM.

- E2: It is conceivable that software could be developed on top of an LLM to assist Political Scientists in preparing for committee meetings by summarizing relevant documents, providing insights, or even generating potential discussion points. However, the core task of serving on committees still heavily relies on human judgment, interaction, and decision-making that cannot be fully automated by an LLM or its applications.

- E3: The task of serving on committees does not involve image processing or analysis, so the image capabilities of an LLM would not significantly impact the completion of this task.
