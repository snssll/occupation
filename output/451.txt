1: In this task of aligning wheels, axles, frames, torsion bars, and steering mechanisms of automobiles, the process involves a high level of technical expertise and precision. While the task itself is hands-on and requires physical manipulation of equipment, there are aspects that could potentially benefit from LLM exposure. For example, an LLM could assist in providing detailed instructions, troubleshooting tips, or explanations of complex alignment concepts. However, the core of the task still heavily relies on physical work and specialized equipment, which cannot be directly substituted by LLM capabilities. Therefore, the exposure to LLM would not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with high quality.
