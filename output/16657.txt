1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of supporting, planning, and coordinating operations for surveys as a Survey Researcher, we need to consider the level of exposure to LLM. 

- E1: Direct exposure - If the task involves writing and transforming text related to survey operations, providing edits to existing survey plans, or generating questions for surveys, the LLM could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete these tasks with equivalent quality by at least half.
  
- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not reduce the time to complete the task by half, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to summarize survey data, retrieve up-to-date information for surveys, or provide recommendations based on survey responses, which could streamline the process.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Since the task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images, the image capabilities of the LLM are not relevant in this context.
