1: In this task, an Engine and Other Machine Assembler is required to fasten or install piping, fixtures, or wiring and electrical components to form assemblies or subassemblies using various tools. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if the task can be significantly expedited or improved by using the LLM. 

- E0: This task involves physical work that requires manual dexterity and the use of tools like hand tools, rivet guns, or welding equipment. The task does not involve text-based information processing or decision-making that could be enhanced by the LLM.
- E1: While the LLM could potentially provide information on best practices, safety guidelines, or troubleshooting tips related to assembling engines and machines, the core task of physically fastening or installing components cannot be directly assisted by the LLM. The LLM cannot physically manipulate tools or equipment.
- E2: It is conceivable that a specialized software application could be developed on top of the LLM that provides detailed step-by-step instructions, safety protocols, or troubleshooting guidance specific to different machine assemblies. This software could potentially enhance the efficiency of the assembler by providing real-time information or recommendations.
- E3: The task does not involve image processing or creation, so the additional capabilities provided by image recognition would not significantly impact the completion of the task.
