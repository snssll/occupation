1: In this task, a baker is responsible for ordering or receiving supplies or equipment for their bakery. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes for a baker to complete this task with high quality. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM could potentially assist in generating supply orders based on specific criteria provided by the baker. It could help in organizing the list of supplies needed, suggesting suppliers, or even drafting emails for ordering. This direct assistance could streamline the process significantly.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not reduce the time by half for this task, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to create an automated system for inventory management, supply ordering, and tracking. Such a system could integrate with suppliers, maintain inventory levels, and optimize the ordering process.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities would not be relevant for this task as it primarily involves text-based activities like ordering supplies and equipment.

Considering the options, the task of ordering or receiving supplies or equipment for bakers could benefit from the direct assistance of the LLM in generating orders, suggesting suppliers, and organizing the process. Therefore, the most suitable exposure label for this task is E1.
