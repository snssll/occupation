1: In this task, the Funeral Attendants are required to provide advice to mourners on how to make charitable donations in honor of the deceased. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM can assist in completing it. 

- Funeral Attendants typically provide guidance and support to mourners during funeral services. The task of advising on charitable donations involves recommending organizations, explaining donation processes, and possibly suggesting meaningful ways to honor the deceased through donations.
- The LLM can assist in this task by generating sample scripts or responses for advising mourners on charitable donations. It can provide information on various charitable organizations, donation methods, and appropriate ways to honor the deceased through donations.
- The LLM can also help Funeral Attendants craft personalized messages or recommendations based on the specific circumstances of the deceased individual and the preferences of the mourners.

Based on these considerations, the task of providing advice to mourners on how to make charitable donations in honor of the deceased can be significantly aided by the LLM, as it can generate relevant information, suggestions, and responses to assist Funeral Attendants in fulfilling this aspect of their role.
