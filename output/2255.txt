1: In this task, the Director of Religious Activities and Education is required to collaborate with ministry members to establish goals and objectives for religious education programs or to develop ways to encourage program participation. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be significantly aided by the use of the language model. The LLM can assist in generating ideas, drafting communication materials, providing insights on effective strategies, and even suggesting ways to increase program participation. Since the task involves text-based collaboration and planning, the LLM can be used to streamline the process, provide suggestions, and enhance the overall efficiency of the task.

Considering the nature of the task and the potential for the LLM to assist in generating ideas, drafting plans, and improving communication, it aligns more closely with E1 exposure. The LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to collaborate, plan, and develop strategies for religious education programs, making the task more efficient and effective.
