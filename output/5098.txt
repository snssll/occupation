1: Biostatisticians analyze and interpret data related to biological phenomena, such as the spread of infectious diseases. They often develop or use mathematical models to track these changes. To determine the exposure level of this task to LLM, we can break it down as follows:

- Writing and transforming text: The task involves analyzing data and developing mathematical models, which may require writing and transforming text to explain the results and implications of the models.
- Providing edits to existing text: Biostatisticians may need to provide edits to existing text in research papers or reports related to their findings.
- Summarizing medium-length documents: They may need to summarize research papers, data sets, or reports to extract key information for their analysis.
- Analyzing written information to inform decisions: The task involves analyzing written information (data, research papers) to make informed decisions about tracking changes in biological phenomena.

Based on these considerations, the task of developing or using mathematical models to track changes in biological phenomena aligns closely with the capabilities of an LLM in terms of analyzing and interpreting data, writing and transforming text, and summarizing documents.
