1: In this task, a coroner needs to locate and document information about the next of kin of a deceased person, including their relationship to the deceased and the status of notification attempts. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if the task can be significantly expedited or improved by using the LLM. 

- The task involves information retrieval and documentation, which are areas where the LLM excels.
- The LLM can assist in searching for information related to next of kin, relationships, and notification attempts.
- The LLM can help in summarizing and organizing the gathered information.
- The LLM can potentially provide templates or guidance on how to document this information effectively.

Considering these points, the task can benefit from the LLM's capabilities in information retrieval, summarization, and documentation, which could streamline the process and improve the quality of the output.
