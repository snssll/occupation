1: In this task, the occupation of riggers involves loading machines onto trucks to prepare for transportation. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality by at least half.

- E0: This task involves physical labor and hands-on work that cannot be replaced by text-based interactions with the LLM. The task requires manual dexterity and physical strength, which the LLM cannot provide.

- E1: The task description does not involve complex text transformations, writing, summarizing, or any other text-based activities that the LLM could directly assist with. The task is more practical and hands-on, which the LLM cannot perform.

- E2: While it's conceivable that software could be developed to assist with logistics planning or scheduling related to loading machines onto trucks, the core task of physically loading the machines onto trucks is not something that the LLM alone or software built on top of it could significantly expedite.

- E3: The task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images. The task is focused on physical actions rather than visual or text-based tasks that could benefit from image capabilities.

Based on the analysis above, the task of loading machines onto trucks to prepare for transportation is best classified as E0.

2: E0

3: Certainty level: High
