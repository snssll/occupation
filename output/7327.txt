- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While an LLM alone may not be able to reduce the time to complete the task by half, additional software could be developed to streamline the process further. This software could potentially analyze the qualifications of trainers or coaches, provide recommendations based on client needs, and assist in decision-making.
