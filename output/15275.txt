1: In this task, a Medical Records Specialist is required to scan patients' health records into electronic formats. With the help of the LLM, the specialist could potentially automate the process of scanning by using optical character recognition (OCR) technology to convert the physical records into electronic formats. The LLM could also assist in organizing and categorizing the scanned records efficiently. This task involves text input (the patients' health records) and text output (the electronic formats of the records), which falls within the capabilities of the LLM. The LLM can help in transforming text and maintaining records of written data, making the task suitable for exposure to LLM.
