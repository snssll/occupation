1: In this task, a Labor Relations Specialist is required to develop methods to monitor employee satisfaction with policies or working conditions, including grievance or complaint procedures. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we can break down the task as follows:

- Writing and transforming text: The task involves developing methods, which may require writing and transforming text to create surveys, questionnaires, or other monitoring tools.
- Providing feedback on documents: The specialist may need to provide feedback on existing policies or procedures based on the monitoring results.
- Analyzing written information to inform decisions: The specialist will need to analyze the feedback received from employees to make informed decisions on potential improvements.
- Prepare training materials: Depending on the findings, the specialist may need to prepare training materials for employees or management on how to address identified issues.

Given that the task involves primarily working with text, analyzing information, and potentially preparing materials based on the data collected, it aligns closely with the capabilities of an LLM. The LLM can assist in generating survey questions, analyzing feedback, and even drafting reports or training materials based on the results.
