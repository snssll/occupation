1: Commercial Divers are responsible for performing various tasks underwater, including installing pilings or footings for structures like piers or bridges. To determine the appropriate label for this task in relation to exposure to LLM, we need to consider the nature of the task. Installing pilings or footings for piers or bridges involves physical work underwater, which cannot be directly assisted by an LLM. The task requires specialized skills, knowledge of underwater construction, and physical capabilities that an LLM cannot provide. Therefore, this task falls under the category of E0 as it does not involve text-based work that can be significantly aided by an LLM.
