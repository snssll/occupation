1: In this task, a Clinical Data Manager is responsible for developing project-specific data management plans. This involves addressing various areas such as coding, reporting, transfer of data, database locks, and workflow processes. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it.

- E0: This task involves specialized knowledge and expertise in clinical data management, which may not be easily automated by the LLM alone. The task requires understanding specific project requirements, regulations, and best practices in data management, which may not be effectively handled by the LLM without significant human input.

- E1: The LLM could potentially assist in providing general information or templates related to data management plans. It could help in generating initial drafts or summaries based on input provided by the Clinical Data Manager. However, the task involves complex decision-making and domain-specific knowledge that may not be fully addressed by the LLM alone.

- E2: With additional software development, the LLM could potentially be used to summarize existing data management plans, retrieve up-to-date information on regulations or best practices, and provide recommendations based on the input provided. This could streamline the process of developing data management plans but may still require human expertise for final decision-making.

- E3: The task does not involve image capabilities, so this label is not applicable.

2: E2

3: Moderate
