1: In this task, a Proofreader or Copy Marker is responsible for reviewing proofs with corrections and routing them to the appropriate individuals for further action. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we can break down the task:
- Reading and understanding the corrections on the proofs.
- Identifying the correct recipients (authors, editors, typists, or typesetters) for the corrections.
- Routing the proofs to the designated individuals for correction or reprinting.

Given that the task involves mainly reading, understanding, and routing text-based information, the LLM could potentially assist in summarizing the corrections, suggesting appropriate recipients based on context, and even drafting communication to accompany the proofs.
