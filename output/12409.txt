1: In this task of preparing badges, passes, and identification cards, and performing security-related duties, the exposure to LLM can be evaluated as follows:

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** The task involves a straightforward and well-defined set of instructions that can be easily communicated to the LLM. The model can assist in generating text for the badges, passes, and identification cards, as well as providing information on security-related procedures. It can also help in creating templates or designs for these items. Overall, the task can be completed efficiently with the direct use of the LLM.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the LLM alone can handle the text generation and basic information needed for this task, additional software could be developed to streamline the process further. For example, an application could be created that automates the badge and pass creation process based on inputs provided by the LLM. This application could integrate with security systems to enhance security-related duties. Therefore, there is potential for software beyond the LLM to optimize this task.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** This task does not involve detailed image processing or editing, so the image capabilities provided by the LLM are not essential for completing the task more efficiently.
