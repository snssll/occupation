1: In this task, a Bridge and Lock Tender is required to observe approaching vessels to determine their size and speed, as well as listen for whistle signals indicating the vessels' desire to pass. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if access to the LLM could significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality.

- Direct exposure (E1): The task of observing vessels and listening for whistle signals involves real-time observation and decision-making based on sensory input. The LLM, being a text-based model, cannot directly observe or listen to real-world signals. Therefore, it cannot assist in completing this task in a way that significantly reduces the time required.

- Exposure by LLM-powered applications (E2): While it is conceivable that specialized software could be developed to assist with maritime operations, such as providing real-time data on approaching vessels or automating some aspects of signal detection, the current capabilities of the LLM alone do not offer a direct solution to this task.

- Exposure given image capabilities (E3): The task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images. Therefore, the image capabilities of the LLM are not relevant to this task.

Based on the above analysis, the task of observing approaching vessels and listening for whistle signals is best classified as E0 - No exposure.

2: E0

3: High
