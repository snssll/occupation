1: In this task, a locksmith or safe repairer is required to keep records of company locks and keys. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task and how an LLM could potentially assist in completing it. 

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** An LLM could help in writing and organizing the records of company locks and keys. It can assist in maintaining detailed and accurate records, ensuring that all necessary information is captured. The LLM can also generate reports or summaries based on the data provided. Therefore, this task could be completed more efficiently with the direct assistance of an LLM.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While an LLM alone can assist in organizing and maintaining records, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to further streamline the process. This software could potentially automate data entry, provide insights or recommendations based on the records, or integrate with other systems for enhanced record-keeping capabilities.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Image capabilities are not directly relevant to the task of keeping records of company locks and keys. This task primarily involves text-based information and does not require image processing or analysis.

Based on the above considerations, the most suitable label for this task would be **E1 (Direct exposure)**.
