1: In this task, a Clinical Research Coordinator is required to contact outside health care providers and communicate with subjects to obtain follow-up information. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we can break down the task as follows:

- Contacting outside health care providers: The LLM can assist in drafting emails or messages to these providers, summarizing information to be communicated, and potentially even suggesting follow-up questions based on the context provided.
- Communicating with subjects: The LLM can help in drafting communication templates, summarizing information received from subjects, and potentially even generating responses based on the information provided.

Given that the task involves a significant amount of written communication and information processing, the LLM can greatly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality. Therefore, this task falls under the E1 label as direct access to the LLM can significantly expedite the completion of the task.
