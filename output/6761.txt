1: In this task of executing wire transfers of funds as a New Accounts Clerk, the primary responsibility involves processing financial transactions. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the complexity and nature of the task. 

- E0: This task does not involve any specialized domain knowledge or complex decision-making that would require the capabilities of an LLM. It is a straightforward task that can be completed efficiently by following standard procedures and protocols. Therefore, there is no clear indication that access to an LLM would significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task.

- E1: While an LLM could potentially assist in generating written instructions or providing guidance on standard wire transfer procedures, the task itself does not involve complex instructions or transformations that would require the advanced capabilities of an LLM. The task is more operational and procedural in nature, focusing on the execution of wire transfers based on established protocols. Therefore, direct access to an LLM may not significantly reduce the time needed to complete this task with equivalent quality.

- E2: It is conceivable that additional software could be developed on top of an LLM to streamline the process of executing wire transfers by automating certain steps or providing real-time verification checks. This software could potentially enhance the efficiency of the task by integrating with banking systems and ensuring compliance with regulations. However, the task itself is not inherently complex or data-intensive, so the benefits of such software may not result in a significant time reduction for an experienced worker.

- E3: The task of executing wire transfers does not involve image processing or visual data that would require additional capabilities beyond text-based processing. Therefore, the inclusion of image capabilities would not have a significant impact on the time needed to complete this task.
