1: In this task, a Loan Officer is required to authorize or sign mail collection letters. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it. 

- E0: This task involves physical signing of letters, which cannot be automated by the LLM. Additionally, the task may require specific legal knowledge or context that the LLM alone may not be able to provide.

- E1: The LLM could potentially assist in drafting the content of the collection letters based on provided information or templates. It could also help in proofreading and refining the language used in the letters. However, the actual authorization or physical signing of the letters would still need to be done manually.

- E2: While the LLM could be used to generate templates for collection letters and provide guidance on effective language to use, it may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task. Developing additional software on top of the LLM that could automate the entire process of generating, authorizing, and sending collection letters might be possible but would require more specialized tools beyond the LLM itself.

- E3: Image capabilities are not relevant for this task.
