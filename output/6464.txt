1: In this task, a Nurse Anesthetist is required to evaluate patients' post-surgical or post-anesthesia responses and take appropriate corrective actions or request consultation if complications occur. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be significantly aided by the use of the language model. The task involves assessing patients' conditions, identifying complications, and deciding on appropriate actions, which require medical knowledge, experience, and critical thinking skills. While the LLM can provide general information on post-surgical or post-anesthesia responses, it lacks the specialized medical expertise and hands-on assessment required in this task. The task also involves human interaction and physical assessment, which cannot be replaced by the LLM. Therefore, the task does not significantly benefit from the use of the LLM, and it falls under E0.
