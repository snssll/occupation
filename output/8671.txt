1: In this task, a Postal Service Clerk is responsible for keeping money drawers in order, recording daily transactions, and balancing them. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves routine data entry, record-keeping, and basic financial transactions. An LLM could potentially assist in generating templates for recording transactions, providing guidelines on balancing transactions, or even offering suggestions for organizing money drawers efficiently. However, since the task primarily involves manual work and does not require complex decision-making or specialized knowledge beyond basic financial procedures, the LLM's assistance may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as the use of an LLM is unlikely to halve the time needed for an experienced worker to complete it with high quality.
