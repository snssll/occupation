1: In this task, an Ophthalmic Medical Technologist or Technician is required to measure visual acuity using various tests. This task involves precise measurements of visual acuity, which cannot be directly performed by an LLM. The LLM does not have the capability to physically administer tests or measure visual acuity accurately. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not involve text-based tasks that the LLM can assist with.
