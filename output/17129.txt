1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of training employees on organizations' timekeeping systems as a Payroll and Timekeeping Clerk, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be impacted by the use of the LLM.

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** If the task involves creating training materials, providing instructions, or answering questions related to timekeeping systems, the LLM could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete these tasks with equivalent quality. The LLM can help in generating training materials, responding to queries, and explaining complex concepts related to timekeeping systems.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the LLM alone may not reduce the time by half for this task, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to create interactive training modules, quizzes, or simulations for employees to learn about timekeeping systems more effectively. Such software could enhance the training process and make it more engaging and informative.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Image capabilities would not significantly impact the task of training employees on timekeeping systems, as the task primarily involves verbal or written instructions rather than visual aids or image processing.
