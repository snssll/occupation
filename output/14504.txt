1: In this task, a Glass Blower, Molder, Bender, or Finisher is required to repair broken scrolls by replacing them with new sections of tubing. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. Repairing broken scrolls by replacing them with new sections of tubing involves physical work with glass materials, which cannot be directly assisted by the LLM. The task requires hands-on skills, precision, and knowledge of glass blowing techniques, which are not within the capabilities of the LLM. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not involve text-based work that can be significantly aided by the LLM.
