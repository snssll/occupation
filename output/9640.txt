1: In this task, the Explosives Workers, Ordnance Handling Experts, and Blasters are required to measure the depths of drilled blast holes using weighted tape measures. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if access to the LLM or LLM-powered tools can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality.

- The task involves physical measurement using weighted tape measures, which cannot be directly replaced by text-based instructions or responses from the LLM.
- The LLM does not have the capability to physically measure depths of blast holes.
- While the LLM could potentially provide information on best practices for measuring blast holes or safety guidelines related to explosives handling, it cannot directly perform the physical measurement task.
- There are no text-based or image-based capabilities that would significantly reduce the time it takes to physically measure blast hole depths.

Based on these considerations, the task of measuring depths of drilled blast holes using weighted tape measures falls under E0 as it does not meet the criteria for exposure to LLM capabilities.
