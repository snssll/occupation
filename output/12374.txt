1: In this task, a Video Game Designer is required to prepare and revise initial game sketches using graphical design software. The task involves creating visual representations of game concepts in both two- and three-dimensional formats. With the capabilities of the LLM, it is possible to assist in generating ideas for game concepts, providing feedback on the narrative or storyline elements of the game, and even suggesting creative directions for the game design. However, the LLM itself does not have the ability to directly create or manipulate graphical designs in two- or three-dimensional formats. While it can provide textual descriptions or guidance, the actual implementation of these ideas into visual sketches would require specialized graphical design software that the LLM does not possess. Therefore, the task does not fall under E1 as it cannot be completed solely by the LLM. Additionally, while it is conceivable that additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to assist in creating game sketches, the complexity and specificity of graphical design software needed for this task make it less likely that such software would significantly reduce the time to complete the task. As a result, the task does not fit under E2 either. Since the task involves working with graphical design software and creating visual representations, which are beyond the capabilities of the LLM, it falls under E0.
