1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of attaching accessories or ornamentation to decorate or protect products as a Shoe and Leather Worker and Repairer, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be aided by the use of a large language model (LLM).

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** The task involves a straightforward and specific action of attaching accessories or ornamentation to products. An LLM could assist in providing guidance on different types of accessories, ornamentation, or techniques to use. It could also help generate creative ideas for decoration. The LLM could potentially reduce the time it takes to complete the task by providing detailed instructions or suggestions on how to attach the accessories effectively.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the task itself is relatively simple and does not require highly specialized domain knowledge, it may not benefit significantly from additional software beyond the capabilities of the LLM. The task does not involve complex decision-making or analysis that would require specialized tools beyond what the LLM can offer.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** This task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images. Therefore, the image capabilities provided by the LLM are not relevant to this task.
