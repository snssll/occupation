1: In this task, the occupation involves Gambling Change Persons and Booth Cashiers, who are responsible for exchanging coins and tokens for cash, answering customers' questions, and maintaining a clean and organized casino environment. The specific task mentioned is cleaning casino areas. 

To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if access to the LLM or LLM-powered tools can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete the task of cleaning casino areas. Since this task involves physical cleaning of spaces, it does not directly involve text input or output that the LLM can process. Additionally, cleaning tasks typically require manual labor and physical presence, which cannot be replaced by the LLM. Therefore, the task of cleaning casino areas does not align with any of the exposure levels in the rubric.
