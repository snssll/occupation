1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of conducting fact-finding or mediation sessions among government units, landowners, or other agencies to resolve disputes as a Conservation Scientist, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves facilitating discussions, gathering information, and potentially providing recommendations for resolution. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM can assist in preparing for these sessions by providing background information on relevant laws, regulations, or case studies related to conservation disputes. It can also help in drafting communication materials or reports summarizing key points discussed during the sessions.
- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time it takes to conduct mediation sessions, additional software could be developed to analyze past conservation disputes, provide recommendations based on successful resolutions, or even simulate potential outcomes of different negotiation strategies.
- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities would not significantly impact the task of conducting fact-finding or mediation sessions in this context.

Based on the above analysis, the task of conducting fact-finding or mediation sessions among government units, landowners, or other agencies to resolve disputes as a Conservation Scientist would likely fall under E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications.
