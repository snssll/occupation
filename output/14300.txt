1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of relaying complaint and emergency-request information to appropriate agency dispatchers as a Police and Sheriff's Patrol Officer, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be aided by the use of a large language model (LLM).

- E1: Direct exposure - In this case, the LLM could assist in drafting the communication to ensure clarity, accuracy, and adherence to protocols. The model could help in formulating the message, selecting the appropriate language, and ensuring all necessary details are included.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time it takes to relay the information, additional software could be developed to integrate with the LLM. This software could potentially automate parts of the process, such as extracting key details from the complaint or emergency request and structuring the information for dispatchers.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities would not be relevant for this task as it involves relaying information through text communication rather than visual content.

Considering the task involves text-based communication and the potential for the LLM to assist in drafting messages effectively, the most appropriate label seems to be E1: Direct exposure.

2: E1
