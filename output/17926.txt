1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of writing or reviewing security-related documents as a Security Manager, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves working with text, specifically security-related content. The LLM can assist in writing and transforming text according to complex instructions, providing edits to existing text following specifications, and summarizing medium-length documents. Given that the task involves working with text and does not require specialized domain knowledge beyond security-related information, the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality. Therefore, this task falls under the E1 category as direct access to the LLM can expedite the process of writing or reviewing security-related documents.
