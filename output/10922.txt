1: In this task, a commercial diver is required to operate underwater video, sonar, recording, or related equipment to investigate underwater structures or marine life. This task involves hands-on work underwater, which cannot be directly assisted by an LLM. The LLM does not have the capability to physically operate equipment or interact with the underwater environment. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not involve text-based work that can be significantly assisted by the LLM.

2: E0
