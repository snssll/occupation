1: In this task, the Computer Network Support Specialist is required to install or repair network cables, including fiber optic cables. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves physical installation and repair of network cables, which cannot be directly assisted by the LLM. The LLM does not have the capability to physically handle cables or perform tasks that require physical interaction. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not involve text-based work that can be significantly assisted by the LLM.
