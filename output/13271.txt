1: In this task, a dermatologist is required to provide dermabrasion or laser abrasion to treat various skin conditions. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. Providing dermabrasion or laser abrasion involves a hands-on medical procedure that requires physical interaction with patients. This task cannot be completed solely through text input and output, as it involves precise physical actions and decision-making based on direct observation of the patient's skin condition. The task also requires specialized medical knowledge and expertise that goes beyond what an LLM can provide. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it cannot be significantly aided by the capabilities of an LLM.
