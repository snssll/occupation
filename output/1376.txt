1: In this task of attaching prostheses to performers and applying makeup to create special effects, an LLM could potentially assist by providing detailed step-by-step instructions on how to attach prostheses correctly, recommend the best makeup products for creating specific effects like scars or aging, and suggest techniques for achieving realistic results. The LLM could also generate ideas for unique special effects makeup designs based on input provided. However, since this task involves physical interaction with performers and requires hands-on application of makeup and prostheses, the LLM alone cannot significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task. While the LLM can provide guidance and suggestions, the actual application of makeup and prostheses is a manual process that cannot be fully automated by the LLM.
