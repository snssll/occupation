1: In this task, a Database Administrator is responsible for developing standards and guidelines for software use and acquisition to protect sensitive information. To complete this task, the Database Administrator would need to research best practices, industry standards, and potentially legal requirements related to software usage and data protection. They would also need to draft detailed documentation outlining these standards and guidelines.

Considering the task involves researching, synthesizing information, and creating detailed documentation, the most suitable exposure label would be E1. Direct access to the LLM could significantly reduce the time it takes to gather relevant information, draft the guidelines, and ensure that the documentation is comprehensive and well-written.

2: E1

3: Moderate
