1: In this task, a Mixing and Blending Machine Setter, Operator, or Tender unloads mixtures into containers or conveyors for further processing. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. Unloading mixtures into containers or conveyors is a physical action that requires manual labor and cannot be directly performed by an LLM. The task does not involve complex text input or output, and it does not require the use of specialized knowledge or up-to-date information that the LLM could provide. Therefore, this task does not align with any of the exposure levels in the rubric.

2: E0

3: High
