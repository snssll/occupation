1: In this task, a midwife is required to establish and follow emergency or contingency plans for mothers and newborns. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if direct access to the LLM could significantly reduce the time it takes for a midwife to complete this task with equivalent quality. 

- Direct exposure (E1): Direct access to the LLM could potentially assist midwives in quickly accessing up-to-date information on emergency procedures, guidelines, or best practices for mothers and newborns. The LLM could provide relevant information on various scenarios and help in decision-making during emergencies. This could save time compared to manually searching through resources or consulting colleagues.

- Exposure by LLM-powered applications (E2): While the LLM alone may not reduce the time by half for this task, additional software built on top of the LLM could enhance the capabilities for midwives. For example, an application that retrieves real-time data on emergency protocols, recent medical advancements, or specific case studies could further streamline the process of establishing and following emergency plans.

- Exposure given image capabilities (E3): Image capabilities would not significantly impact the task of establishing and following emergency plans for mothers and newborns. This task primarily involves knowledge of medical procedures, protocols, and decision-making rather than visual or image-related tasks.

Based on the considerations above, the task of establishing and following emergency or contingency plans for mothers and newborns aligns best with Exposure by LLM-powered applications (E2).
