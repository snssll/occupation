1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of planning environmental restoration projects as an Environmental Restoration Planner, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it. 

- Environmental Restoration Planners typically rely on biological databases, environmental strategies, and planning software to develop restoration projects. The LLM could potentially assist in accessing and analyzing information from biological databases, providing insights on environmental strategies, and even generating initial project plans based on input data.
- The task involves utilizing specialized knowledge in environmental science and restoration techniques, which may not be directly accessible through the LLM alone. However, the LLM could be used to gather general information, provide suggestions, or assist in drafting project reports.
- While the LLM may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task by half, it is conceivable that additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to streamline the process by integrating specialized environmental knowledge and project planning capabilities.

Based on these considerations, the task of planning environmental restoration projects as an Environmental Restoration Planner falls under label E2 - Exposure by LLM-powered applications.
