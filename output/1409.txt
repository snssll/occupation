1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of attending company meetings to exchange product information and coordinate work activities with other departments as a First-Line Supervisor of Non-Retail Sales Workers, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be impacted by the use of the LLM.

- This task involves attending meetings, exchanging information, and coordinating activities, which are primarily based on human interaction, communication, and decision-making.
- While the LLM can provide information and generate text, it cannot physically attend meetings or interact with other departments in real-time.
- The task does not involve writing or transforming text/code, summarizing documents, providing feedback, or any other text-based activities that the LLM could significantly assist with.
- The task also does not involve image processing, searching for specialized domain knowledge, or making recommendations based on data.

Based on these considerations, the task of attending company meetings as a First-Line Supervisor of Non-Retail Sales Workers is best classified as E0 - No exposure.
