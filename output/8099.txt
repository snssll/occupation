1: In this task, a locksmith is required to install door hardware like locks and closers. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. Installing door hardware involves physical work that cannot be directly performed by an LLM. The task requires hands-on skills, precise measurements, and physical interaction with the door and hardware. While an LLM could potentially provide information on different types of locks and closers, it cannot physically install them. Therefore, the task falls under E0 as it does not involve text-based work that can be significantly aided by an LLM.
