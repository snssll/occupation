1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of recommending financial products as a Personal Financial Advisor, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM can assist in completing it. Personal Financial Advisors typically rely on their expertise, market knowledge, and client-specific information to make recommendations on financial products. The LLM can provide general information on financial products, market trends, and investment strategies, but it lacks the ability to access real-time market data or personalized client information unless provided in the input. While the LLM can generate recommendations based on historical data and general financial principles, it may not be able to provide tailored advice without up-to-date information.

Given these considerations, the task of recommending financial products as a Personal Financial Advisor falls under E2 - Exposure by LLM-powered applications. Although the LLM can assist in generating general recommendations and providing information on financial products, additional software that integrates real-time market data, client-specific details, and personalized financial analysis would further enhance the efficiency and accuracy of the recommendations. This additional software could leverage the LLM's capabilities to analyze data, provide insights, and offer tailored advice based on specific client needs.
