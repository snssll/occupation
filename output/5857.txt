1: In this task of documenting and ensuring communication of key risks as a Financial Risk Specialist, the use of the LLM could potentially fall under different exposure levels:

- E1: Direct exposure to the LLM could significantly reduce the time it takes to document key risks by assisting in generating detailed risk reports, analyzing complex financial data, and drafting clear communication materials regarding these risks. The LLM could help in summarizing information, providing insights, and even suggesting potential risks based on the input data.

- E2: While the LLM alone may not reduce the time by half for this task, additional software built on top of the LLM could enhance the process. For instance, a specialized risk assessment tool that integrates with the LLM to extract and analyze data from financial reports, news articles, and other sources to identify potential risks could streamline the risk documentation process.

- E3: Image capabilities are not directly relevant to this task as it primarily involves text-based documentation and communication of risks. Therefore, this task does not fall under E3 exposure.
