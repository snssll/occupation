1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of choosing settings and locations for films and determining how scenes will be shot, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves a high level of creativity, decision-making, and practical knowledge about filmmaking, which are not directly related to text-based tasks that the LLM excels at. While the LLM could potentially provide some general information or suggestions based on existing data, it cannot replace the expertise and experience required for this task. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not clearly decrease the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete the task with high quality by at least half.

2: E0

3: High
