1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of referring patients to specialists or community resources as a Genetic Counselor, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be completed with the help of an LLM.

- Genetic Counselors typically rely on their expertise and knowledge of genetics to assess patients' risks and provide appropriate referrals.
- In this specific task, the Genetic Counselor needs to identify suitable specialists or community resources based on the patient's genetic condition or risk factors.
- An LLM could assist by providing information on available specialists, community resources, and best practices in genetic counseling.
- The LLM could also help in generating referral letters or communication to the specialists or resources.

Considering the task involves accessing and processing information to make appropriate referrals, an LLM could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task by providing relevant information and guidance.
