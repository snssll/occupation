1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of providing media commentary or criticism related to public policy and political issues and events as a Political Scientist, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be supported by the capabilities of the LLM.

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** The task involves analyzing and commenting on public policy and political events, which requires a deep understanding of current affairs, policy implications, and political dynamics. While the LLM can provide information and insights based on existing data and knowledge, it may not have access to real-time information or the ability to analyze the most recent events unless explicitly provided in the input. The LLM can assist in generating commentary based on historical data and trends, but for up-to-date analysis and criticism, a Political Scientist would need to rely on current news sources and events.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the LLM can help generate insights and analysis based on historical data and trends, it may not be able to provide real-time updates or access the most recent information. However, with additional software development, it is conceivable that an application could be built on top of the LLM to aggregate and analyze current news sources, public policy updates, and political events to provide timely information for commentary and criticism. This application could enhance the efficiency of the Political Scientist in staying up-to-date with the latest developments.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Image capabilities would not significantly impact the task of providing media commentary or criticism related to public policy and political issues and events, as the task primarily involves text-based analysis and interpretation of political events and policies. Image capabilities are not essential for this task.
