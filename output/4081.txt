1: In this task, a Floor Layer is required to cut covering and foundation materials according to blueprints and sketches. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves following specific instructions (blueprints and sketches) to cut materials accurately. This task does not involve complex decision-making, up-to-date information retrieval, specialized domain knowledge, or image processing. The task is primarily manual and technical in nature, focusing on physical skills rather than cognitive processing or information retrieval. Therefore, the task does not align with the capabilities of the LLM or any tools built on top of it. As a result, this task falls under E0 as it does not benefit from exposure to the LLM.

2: E0

3: High
