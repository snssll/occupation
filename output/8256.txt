1: In this task, the Audiovisual Equipment Installers and Repairers are required to instruct customers on the safe and proper use of equipment. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- Direct exposure (E1): The task involves providing instructions to customers, which can be formulated as text input and output. The LLM can assist in generating clear and detailed instructions for the safe and proper use of equipment, potentially reducing the time it takes to create instructional materials. The LLM can help in crafting language that is easy to understand and comprehensive for customers.

- Exposure by LLM-powered applications (E2): While the LLM can aid in generating instructional content, there may not be a specific software application built on top of the LLM that significantly enhances the completion of this task beyond text generation. The task does not involve complex data analysis, specialized domain knowledge, or document summarization that would require additional software capabilities.

- Exposure given image capabilities (E3): The task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images. Therefore, image capabilities are not relevant for this task.

Considering the above analysis, the task of instructing customers on the safe and proper use of equipment aligns most closely with the Direct exposure (E1) label.
