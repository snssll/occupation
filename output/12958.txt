1: In this task, the News Analysts, Reporters, and Journalists are required to present news stories and introduce in-depth videotaped segments or live transmissions from on-the-scene reporters. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves presenting news stories, which requires a human touch, understanding of current events, and the ability to engage with the audience effectively. While an LLM could potentially assist in generating written content or summaries of news stories, the core aspect of presenting news involves human skills such as voice modulation, body language, and real-time interaction with reporters. Additionally, the task involves live transmissions, which require immediate responses and adaptability, something an LLM may not be able to provide in real-time. Therefore, the task is best classified as E0 as it involves a high degree of human interaction and real-time engagement that cannot be effectively replicated by an LLM.
