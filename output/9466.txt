1: In this task of managing the leasing of facility space as a Facilities Manager, the primary responsibilities involve overseeing the leasing process, negotiating lease agreements, coordinating with tenants, ensuring compliance with lease terms, and resolving any issues that may arise during the leasing period. To determine the appropriate exposure label for this task in relation to the LLM, we can break it down as follows:

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** The LLM can assist in drafting and reviewing lease agreements, providing guidance on negotiation strategies, generating responses to tenant inquiries, and maintaining records related to leasing activities. The model can also help in summarizing relevant documents, answering questions about lease terms, and generating communication materials for tenants or stakeholders.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time it takes to manage the leasing of facility space, additional software could be developed to streamline the process. This software could include features like summarizing lengthy lease agreements, retrieving up-to-date market data for informed decision-making, analyzing lease terms for compliance, and providing recommendations based on historical leasing data.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Image capabilities are not directly relevant to managing the leasing of facility space, as this task primarily involves text-based documents, negotiations, and communication with stakeholders. Therefore, image capabilities would not significantly impact the completion of this task.
