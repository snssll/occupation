1: In this task, a Clinical Research Coordinator is responsible for informing patients or caregivers about study aspects and outcomes to be expected. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves providing information to patients or caregivers, which primarily requires written or spoken communication skills. An LLM can assist in generating clear and informative text to communicate study aspects and outcomes effectively. The model can help in crafting detailed explanations, answering potential questions, and ensuring the information is presented in a comprehensive manner. Therefore, the task can be significantly aided by the LLM's capabilities in written communication and information dissemination.

Considering the task's reliance on written or spoken communication and the LLM's ability to generate text and provide information, the task falls under E1 - Direct exposure. The LLM can reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality by at least half by assisting in crafting informative messages for patients or caregivers.
