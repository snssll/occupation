1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of creating or implementing security standards, policies, and procedures as a Security Manager, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The task involves writing and transforming text according to complex instructions, which the LLM can assist with by generating drafts of security standards, policies, and procedures based on provided guidelines. The LLM can also help in refining and editing these documents to ensure they meet the necessary standards.
- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to streamline the process. For example, an application could be created to analyze existing security frameworks and recommend specific policies and procedures based on best practices and current trends.
- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not relevant for this task as it primarily involves text-based work and does not require image processing.

Based on the above analysis, the task of creating or implementing security standards, policies, and procedures as a Security Manager aligns most closely with E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications.
