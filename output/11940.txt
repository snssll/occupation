1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of planning and supervising class projects, field trips, visits by guest speakers, or other experiential activities as a Special Education Teacher, I will consider the following:

- The task involves planning and supervising various educational activities for students.
- The task requires guiding students in learning from these activities.
- The task may involve creating detailed plans, coordinating logistics, and ensuring the educational objectives are met.

Given these considerations, the task does not directly involve text-based inputs or outputs that would significantly benefit from the capabilities of an LLM. While an LLM could potentially assist in generating written materials related to the activities, the core of the task involves hands-on coordination and interaction with students in real-world settings, which cannot be effectively replaced by text-based AI tools.
