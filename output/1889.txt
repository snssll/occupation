1: In this task, a real estate broker is responsible for checking the work completed by loan officers, attorneys, or other professionals to ensure that it is performed properly. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves reviewing documents and verifying that they are accurate and compliant with regulations. This task primarily involves reading and analyzing text to ensure correctness and compliance. An LLM could assist in this task by summarizing documents, providing feedback on the content, and potentially identifying any discrepancies or errors in the text. The LLM could also help in generating questions or responses related to the documents being reviewed. However, since the task does not involve complex databases, highly specialized domain knowledge, or the need for up-to-date facts from the internet, it does not fall under E2. Additionally, the task does not require image capabilities for reading text from PDFs or scanning images. Therefore, the most appropriate label for this task would be E1 as the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task by providing assistance in reviewing and analyzing text-based documents.
