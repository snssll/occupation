1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of negotiating settlements of civil disputes for lawyers, we need to consider the capabilities of the OpenAI large language model (LLM). 

- Lawyers negotiating settlements often involve complex legal language, understanding of case law, and the ability to craft persuasive arguments. The LLM can assist in drafting legal documents, providing legal advice, and suggesting negotiation strategies based on legal principles.
- The LLM can generate responses to counterarguments, propose settlement terms, and simulate potential outcomes of different negotiation strategies.
- While the LLM can provide valuable insights and suggestions, the negotiation process itself typically involves human interaction, understanding of non-verbal cues, and real-time decision-making based on the dynamics of the negotiation. These aspects are not fully replicable by the LLM alone.

Based on these considerations, the task of negotiating settlements of civil disputes for lawyers would fall under E2 - Exposure by LLM-powered applications. While the LLM can provide valuable support in terms of legal knowledge, drafting documents, and suggesting negotiation strategies, the task still heavily relies on human judgment, interpersonal skills, and real-time decision-making that cannot be fully automated by the LLM alone.
