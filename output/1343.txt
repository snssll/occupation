1: In this task, a First-Line Supervisor of Material-Moving Machine and Vehicle Operators is required to assist workers in tasks such as loading vehicles. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality. Since the task involves physical labor and direct interaction with workers, it is unlikely that the LLM can directly assist in completing the task. The LLM cannot physically load vehicles or interact with workers in person, so it cannot provide a significant time-saving benefit for this task.
