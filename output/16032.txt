1: In this task, a Mechanical Engineer is required to solicit new business, which involves reaching out to potential clients, presenting proposals, and negotiating contracts. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes for a Mechanical Engineer to solicit new business. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM could assist in drafting compelling proposals, crafting persuasive emails, or providing guidance on negotiation tactics. This could streamline the process of reaching out to potential clients and presenting information effectively.
- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not drastically reduce the time for soliciting new business, additional software could be developed to analyze market trends, generate targeted client lists, or provide real-time feedback on negotiation strategies, which could enhance the efficiency of the task.
- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not relevant for the task of soliciting new business as it primarily involves written communication and interactions with clients.

Considering the above points, the task of soliciting new business as a Mechanical Engineer could be best classified as E2, Exposure by LLM-powered applications.
