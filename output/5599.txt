1: In this task, a crossing guard or flagger is responsible for directing traffic movement and warning of hazards using various tools like signs, flags, lanterns, and hand signals. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality. Since this task involves physical actions such as using hand signals and interacting with moving vehicles, it cannot be effectively completed using the LLM or any LLM-powered tools. The task requires real-time decision-making, physical presence, and ensuring the safety of individuals on the road, which are not capabilities of the LLM.
