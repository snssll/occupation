1: In this task, a Medical Equipment Preparer is responsible for purging wastes from equipment by connecting it to water sources and flushing water through systems. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves a physical action of connecting equipment to water sources and flushing water through systems, which cannot be directly performed by an LLM.
- While the task description is straightforward, it requires physical interaction and manual labor, which are not within the capabilities of an LLM.
- The task does not involve complex decision-making, analysis, or specialized knowledge that would benefit significantly from LLM capabilities.
- There is no text input or output involved that could be streamlined or enhanced by an LLM.

Based on these considerations, the task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of an LLM or any tools built on top of it.
