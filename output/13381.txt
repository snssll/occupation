1: In this task, a Special Education Teacher in a Secondary School is required to provide interpretation and transcription of regular classroom materials through Braille and sign language. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The LLM can assist in tasks that involve text input and output, but it does not have the ability to interpret or transcribe materials into Braille or sign language. This task requires specialized skills in Braille and sign language, which are not within the capabilities of the LLM. Therefore, the task cannot be significantly aided by the LLM alone or through additional software that could be developed on top of the LLM. As a result, this task falls under E0 as it does not meet the criteria for exposure to LLM capabilities.
