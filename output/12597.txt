1: In this task, a retail salesperson is responsible for preparing merchandise for purchase or rental. This involves tasks such as organizing products on shelves, setting up displays, ensuring items are properly tagged with prices, and making sure the store is visually appealing to customers. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes for a retail salesperson to complete this task with high quality. The task itself is very hands-on and physical, involving tasks that cannot be easily automated or completed through text-based instructions alone. While the LLM could potentially provide some guidance on merchandising techniques or product information, the core task of physically preparing merchandise is not something that can be directly impacted by the LLM.
