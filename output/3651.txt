1: For the task of cooking foodstuffs according to menus, special dietary or nutritional restrictions, or numbers of portions to be served as a Cook in an institution or cafeteria, the exposure to LLM can be analyzed as follows:

- **E0**: This task involves physical actions such as cooking, which cannot be directly assisted by an LLM. The LLM cannot physically cook or interact with ingredients, so it cannot significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task.

- **E1**: While the LLM could potentially provide recipes, nutritional information, or menu suggestions based on input, the actual cooking process itself cannot be automated or significantly assisted by the LLM. Therefore, the direct exposure to the LLM would not reduce the time it takes to complete this task by at least half.

- **E2**: It is conceivable that software could be developed on top of the LLM to assist with meal planning, recipe generation, or dietary restriction management. However, the actual cooking process would still require human intervention and physical action, limiting the potential time-saving benefits. 

- **E3**: The LLM does not have image capabilities to view, caption, or create images related to cooking tasks. Therefore, there is no significant reduction in time for completing this task with the addition of image capabilities.
