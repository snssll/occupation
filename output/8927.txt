1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of locating and obtaining existing geographic information databases as a Geographer, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves searching for specific types of data, which can be done through text-based queries. The LLM can assist in generating search queries, summarizing information about different databases, and potentially even suggesting sources for geographic data. However, the task does not involve complex data analysis or decision-making based on the data retrieved. Therefore, the LLM's role would be limited to providing assistance in the initial stages of locating databases rather than performing the entire task.

Considering these factors, the task falls under E2 exposure. While the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task, additional software could be developed to enhance the search capabilities and streamline the process of obtaining geographic information databases.
