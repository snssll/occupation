1: Special Effects Artists and Animators typically work on converting real objects to animated objects through modeling, using techniques such as optical scanning. To determine the appropriate label for this task, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves a high level of creativity, artistic skill, and specialized knowledge in animation techniques. While the LLM can provide information on animation techniques and potentially assist with some aspects of the process through text-based guidance, it lacks the ability to directly perform the visual tasks involved in converting real objects to animated objects. The task also requires hands-on work with visual elements, which is beyond the current capabilities of the LLM. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it involves a high degree of human creativity, artistic interpretation, and hands-on visual work that cannot be effectively automated by the LLM.
