1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of making and modifying plaster casts as an Orthotist and Prosthetist, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves a hands-on, physical aspect of creating plaster casts, which cannot be directly performed by the LLM. While the LLM can provide information on prostheses and orthoses, it cannot physically create or modify plaster casts. Therefore, the task does not fall under E1, as it cannot be directly completed by the LLM alone. Additionally, developing software on top of the LLM to perform physical tasks like making plaster casts is not feasible, so it does not fit under E2 either. Since the task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images, it also does not align with E3. Therefore, the most appropriate label for this task is E0.

2: E0

3: High
