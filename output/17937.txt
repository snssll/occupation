1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of writing performance requirements for product development or engineering projects as a Mechanical Engineer, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be impacted by the use of the LLM.

- Writing performance requirements involves creating detailed specifications that outline the desired characteristics and functionalities of a product or project.
- The task requires a deep understanding of engineering principles, technical knowledge, and industry standards.
- While the LLM can assist in generating text and providing information, it may not have the specialized domain knowledge required for engineering tasks.
- The LLM could potentially help in providing general templates or examples of performance requirements, but the task itself is highly specialized and requires expertise beyond what the LLM can provide.

Based on these considerations, the task of writing performance requirements for product development or engineering projects as a Mechanical Engineer would likely fall under E0 as it involves highly specialized domain knowledge and expertise that the LLM alone may not possess.
