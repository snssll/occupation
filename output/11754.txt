1: In this task, a First-Line Supervisor of Retail Sales Workers is required to perform work activities of subordinates, such as cleaning and organizing shelves, displays, and selling merchandise. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be completed more efficiently with the help of the language model. 

- The task involves physical activities like cleaning and organizing shelves, which cannot be directly assisted by the LLM.
- While the LLM can provide information or guidance on selling merchandise, the task also involves hands-on interaction and demonstration, which the LLM cannot perform.
- The task does not involve complex data analysis, specialized domain knowledge, or detailed document summarization that would significantly benefit from LLM capabilities.

Based on these considerations, the task does not align with any of the exposure levels that would significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with the help of the LLM.
