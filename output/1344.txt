1: In this task, a First-Line Supervisor of Gambling Services Workers is responsible for attaching "out of order" signs to malfunctioning machines and notifying technicians when machines need to be repaired or removed. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves straightforward instructions that can be easily communicated in text form.
- The task does not require specialized domain knowledge beyond basic understanding of gambling machines.
- The task does not involve complex decision-making or analysis.
- The task does not require up-to-date information beyond the general knowledge of how to handle malfunctioning machines.

Given these considerations, the task does not significantly benefit from the capabilities of an LLM beyond basic text processing and communication. While the LLM could potentially assist in drafting notifications to technicians, the task itself is relatively simple and does not require the advanced capabilities of the LLM.
