1: In this task, the Ophthalmic Laboratory Technicians clean finished lenses and eyeglasses using cloths and solvents. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. Cleaning lenses and eyeglasses is a manual task that involves physical interaction with the objects. It does not involve complex decision-making, specialized knowledge, or extensive text-based interactions that would benefit significantly from the capabilities of an LLM. Therefore, this task does not align with any of the exposure levels in the rubric.
