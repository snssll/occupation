1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of carrying out non-destructive testing as a Commercial Diver, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be impacted by the capabilities of the LLM. In this case, the task involves physically inspecting and testing structures underwater, which requires specialized training, equipment, and hands-on experience. The task does not involve text input or output that can be directly processed by the LLM. The LLM cannot physically perform the testing or interact with the underwater environment. Therefore, the task does not fall under E1, E2, or E3 categories as it does not involve text-based processing or image capabilities that can be enhanced by the LLM.

2: E0

3: High
