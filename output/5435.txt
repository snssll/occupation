1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of directing and training library staff in duties, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves providing instructions, guidance, and training to library staff on various responsibilities within a library setting. The LLM can assist in generating training materials, writing instructions, and providing information on library procedures. It can also help in creating documentation for different tasks and processes within the library.

Given that the task involves a significant amount of text-based communication, the LLM can be used to streamline the creation of training materials, instructions, and documentation. The model can assist in summarizing information, generating relevant content, and answering questions related to library duties. While the LLM alone may not reduce the time it takes to complete the task by half, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to further enhance its capabilities in providing training and guidance to library staff. Therefore, the task falls under label E2 - Exposure by LLM-powered applications.
