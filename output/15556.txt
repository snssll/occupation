1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of selecting shipment routes as a Freight Forwarder, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The task involves analyzing various factors such as the nature of goods, transit times, and security needs to select the most suitable shipment routes. An LLM could assist in providing information on different routes, transit times, security considerations, and other relevant factors based on the input provided. The LLM could help in generating route options and providing insights into the pros and cons of each route, ultimately aiding in the decision-making process.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to enhance the process. This software could potentially retrieve up-to-date information on transit times, security updates, or specific route considerations from various sources, integrating this data with the LLM's capabilities to provide more comprehensive recommendations for selecting shipment routes.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities would not significantly impact the task of selecting shipment routes for Freight Forwarders, as the task primarily involves analyzing textual information related to goods, transit times, and security needs rather than relying on visual data.
