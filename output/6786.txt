1: In this task, a First-Line Supervisor of Security Workers is required to explain company policies and procedures to staff using oral or written communication. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves communicating information to staff, which can be done effectively using text-based communication. The LLM can assist in generating written communication, such as drafting emails, memos, or documents that explain company policies and procedures. The LLM can also help in formulating clear and concise explanations. Since the task primarily involves written communication and providing information, the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality. Therefore, this task falls under the E1 exposure label as direct access to the LLM can reduce the time it takes to complete the task by at least half.
