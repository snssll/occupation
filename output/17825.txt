1: In this task, a Weatherization Installer or Technician wraps air ducts and water lines with insulating materials. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. This task involves physical work that requires manual dexterity and the ability to work with insulation materials. It does not involve complex decision-making, analysis, or specialized knowledge beyond the practical application of insulation materials. The task does not involve writing, summarizing documents, providing feedback, or any other text-based activities that could benefit significantly from the use of an LLM. Therefore, this task does not align with any of the exposure labels related to text-based tasks or image capabilities.
