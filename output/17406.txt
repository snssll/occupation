1: In this task, the Orderlies are responsible for turning or repositioning bedridden patients to prevent bedsores. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if the task can be significantly expedited or improved by using the LLM. The task itself is physical and requires direct interaction with patients, which cannot be replaced by text-based tools like the LLM. While the LLM could potentially provide information on best practices for preventing bedsores, it cannot physically assist in turning or repositioning patients. Therefore, the task does not align with any of the exposure labels provided.
