1: In this task, the main activity involves searching for lost articles or parents of lost children. To complete this task, an individual would typically need to communicate with others, physically search the area, and possibly coordinate with security or other staff members. The task does not involve complex data analysis, specialized domain knowledge, or detailed documentation. While an LLM could potentially assist in drafting communication messages or providing general guidance on how to conduct a search, the core aspects of the task require physical presence and human interaction, which cannot be replaced by the LLM. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not significantly benefit from LLM capabilities.
