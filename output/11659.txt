1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of performing routine maintenance or repairs on solar thermal systems, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be aided by the use of a large language model (LLM).

- **E0**: This task involves hands-on work that requires physical interaction with the solar thermal systems. It may involve tasks such as checking components, adjusting settings, or repairing equipment, which cannot be directly assisted by an LLM.

- **E1**: While an LLM could potentially provide information on common maintenance procedures or troubleshooting steps for solar thermal systems, the actual repair work would still require physical intervention and technical expertise beyond what an LLM can provide. Therefore, the direct exposure to an LLM would not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task.

- **E2**: It is conceivable that specialized software could be developed on top of an LLM that could assist in diagnosing issues with solar thermal systems based on input data or providing recommendations for maintenance tasks. However, the hands-on aspect of performing repairs would still require human intervention, limiting the potential time-saving benefits of an LLM.

- **E3**: The task of performing routine maintenance or repairs on solar thermal systems does not involve image processing or detailed visual analysis that would benefit from additional image capabilities. Therefore, exposure to image capabilities would not significantly impact the completion of this task.
