1: In this task, a Fast Food and Counter Worker is required to select food items from serving or storage areas and place them in dishes, on serving trays, or in take-out bags. This task involves physical actions such as picking up items, placing them in containers, and organizing them for serving or take-out. Since this task is primarily physical and does not involve complex decision-making or specialized knowledge that would benefit significantly from the use of an LLM, it is unlikely that access to an LLM would reduce the time it takes to complete the task with high quality by at least half. Therefore, this task would fall under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of an LLM.

2: E0

3: High
