1: In this task, a Court Reporter or Simultaneous Captioner is required to ask speakers to clarify inaudible statements during court proceedings or other events where real-time captioning is needed. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we can analyze the nature of the task. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The task involves listening to spoken statements, identifying inaudible parts, and asking for clarification. An LLM could potentially assist in generating appropriate prompts or questions to ask for clarification based on the context. The LLM could help in formulating clear and concise queries to ensure accurate transcription.
- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task, additional software could be developed to integrate real-time speech recognition capabilities with the LLM to automatically identify and request clarification for inaudible statements. This software could enhance the efficiency of the Court Reporter or Simultaneous Captioner.
- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not directly relevant to this task, as it primarily involves listening to spoken statements and requesting clarification verbally. 

Based on the analysis, the task of asking speakers to clarify inaudible statements aligns most closely with E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications.
