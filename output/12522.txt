1: In this task, a Motion Picture Projectionist is responsible for preparing film inspection reports, attendance sheets, and log books. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- Writing film inspection reports involves documenting the condition of the films, any issues encountered during projection, and any maintenance required. This task involves transforming observations into written reports, which can be efficiently handled by an LLM through text generation capabilities.
- Creating attendance sheets involves listing the names of individuals present at screenings, which is a straightforward task that can be completed using text input and output.
- Maintaining log books involves recording details such as film titles, screening times, and any incidents that occur during screenings. This task also involves text-based data entry and organization.

Given that the task primarily involves writing and organizing textual information, the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete these tasks with equivalent quality. Therefore, this task falls under the E1 label as direct access to the LLM can streamline the process of preparing film inspection reports, attendance sheets, and log books.
