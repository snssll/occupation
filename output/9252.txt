1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of maintaining patient records as an Audiologist, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it. 

- Audiologists typically need to keep detailed and accurate records of patient evaluations, treatments, and progress over time. This task involves organizing and updating patient information, treatment plans, test results, and other relevant data.
- With the help of the LLM, an Audiologist could potentially automate the process of record-keeping by generating detailed reports based on input data. The LLM could assist in summarizing patient information, generating progress reports, and even flagging important details for follow-up.
- The LLM could also help in maintaining consistency and accuracy in record-keeping by providing templates, reminders for follow-up actions, and ensuring that all necessary information is included in the records.

Considering these points, the task of maintaining patient records as an Audiologist could be significantly streamlined and made more efficient with the assistance of the LLM, reducing the time required to complete the task with high quality. Therefore, this task falls under label E1 - Direct exposure.
