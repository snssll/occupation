1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of preparing and delivering lectures to undergraduate or graduate students as a Mathematical Science Teacher, Postsecondary, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be impacted by the use of the LLM.

- E0: This task involves direct interaction with students, explaining complex mathematical concepts, answering questions, and providing guidance. It requires human interaction, real-time feedback, and the ability to adapt to students' understanding levels. The LLM cannot replace the role of a teacher in delivering lectures in a classroom setting.

- E1: While the LLM can assist in generating lecture notes, providing explanations for mathematical concepts, or even creating presentation materials, the core aspect of delivering lectures, which involves real-time interaction, adapting to students' needs, and engaging with the audience, cannot be effectively replaced by the LLM alone. The nuances of teaching, such as gauging student understanding, adjusting the pace of the lecture, and fostering a learning environment, require human expertise.

- E2: It is conceivable that additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to assist in creating lecture materials, generating interactive simulations, or providing personalized practice problems for students. However, the fundamental aspect of delivering lectures, which involves dynamic communication, student engagement, and pedagogical strategies, would still heavily rely on human input.

- E3: The task of preparing and delivering lectures does not involve image processing or analysis that would significantly benefit from image capabilities in conjunction with the LLM. The core of the task lies in verbal communication and interaction with students, which is not enhanced by image capabilities.
