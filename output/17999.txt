1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of writing warnings and citations for illegally parked vehicles as a Parking Enforcement Worker, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The task involves writing text (warnings and citations) based on specific criteria and guidelines. The LLM can assist in generating these texts efficiently and accurately, potentially reducing the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality by at least half. The LLM can understand the context provided and generate the necessary written content.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the task may not require additional software beyond the LLM itself, it is conceivable that specialized software could be developed to streamline the process further. This software could potentially integrate with databases of parking violations, locations, and regulations to automate parts of the citation writing process.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not relevant to the task of writing warnings and citations for illegally parked vehicles. The task is primarily text-based and does not involve image processing.

Based on the above analysis, the task of writing warnings and citations for illegally parked vehicles as a Parking Enforcement Worker is best classified as E1: Direct exposure.
