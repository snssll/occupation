1: In this task, a Cargo and Freight Agent is responsible for packing goods for shipping using various tools. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality. 

- E0: This task involves physical actions such as using tools like staplers, strapping machines, and hammers, which cannot be directly replaced by the LLM. The LLM does not have the capability to physically pack goods for shipping, so it cannot reduce the time significantly for this task.

- E1: The LLM could potentially provide written instructions on how to pack goods efficiently or offer suggestions on the best practices for packing. However, since the task involves physical actions with tools, the LLM alone cannot reduce the time it takes to complete the task by at least half.

- E2: While the LLM could potentially assist in generating written guidelines or safety protocols for packing goods, it cannot directly perform the physical task of packing using tools. Additional software that could be developed on top of the LLM might include a virtual training program for packing techniques, but this would not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task.

- E3: The task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images, so the image capabilities of the LLM are not relevant in this context.

2: E0

3: High
