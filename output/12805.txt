1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of preparing students to act as sports coaches under the occupation of Recreation and Fitness Studies Teachers, Postsecondary, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be completed with the help of an LLM.

- E1: Direct exposure - If the task involves providing detailed instructions, feedback, or generating questions related to sports coaching, an LLM could assist in writing and transforming text according to complex instructions, summarizing relevant information, or generating questions for assessments related to coaching techniques. The LLM could also help in preparing training materials based on general knowledge of sports coaching.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While an LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time to complete the task by half, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to summarize longer documents on coaching techniques, retrieve up-to-date facts related to sports coaching, or provide recommendations based on data or written input about coaching strategies.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities would not significantly impact the task of preparing students to act as sports coaches, as the task primarily involves text-based instructions, feedback, and training materials rather than image-related content.
