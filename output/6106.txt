1: In this task, a substitute teacher is required to enforce school and class rules to maintain order in the classroom. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone or with additional software could significantly reduce the time it takes for a substitute teacher to complete this task with equivalent quality.

- E0: This task involves direct human interaction and real-time decision-making in a classroom setting. The LLM cannot physically enforce rules or manage classroom behavior, which are essential aspects of a substitute teacher's role. Therefore, the LLM or any software built on top of it cannot effectively replace the human judgment and interaction required for this task.
