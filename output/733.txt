1: In this task, a Surveying and Mapping Technician is required to answer questions and provide information regarding assessment maps, surveys, boundaries, property ownership, roads, zoning, and related matters. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves providing information based on existing data and knowledge in the field of surveying and mapping.
- The information required for answering questions is likely to be within the scope of the technician's training and expertise.
- The task does not involve complex decision-making or subjective analysis but rather factual responses based on established data and regulations.

Considering these points, the task falls under E0 as it does not significantly benefit from direct access to an LLM. The task relies more on domain-specific knowledge and expertise rather than the capabilities of an LLM.
