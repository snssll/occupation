1: In this task, the Magnetic Resonance Imaging Technologists are required to instruct medical staff or students in MRI procedures or equipment operation. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- Direct exposure (E1): The task involves providing instructions and guidance on MRI procedures and equipment operation. An LLM could potentially assist in generating detailed instructions, explanations, and even simulations to aid in training. The LLM could help in creating training materials, answering questions related to MRI procedures, and providing feedback on instructional content. Therefore, the LLM could significantly reduce the time needed to prepare training materials and instructions for medical staff or students.

- Exposure by LLM-powered applications (E2): While the LLM alone can assist in generating text-based content for training materials and instructions, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to provide interactive simulations, virtual training environments, or real-time Q&A sessions related to MRI procedures. Such software could enhance the training experience and further reduce the time required to instruct medical staff or students effectively.

- Exposure given image capabilities (E3): Since the task involves instructing in MRI procedures and equipment operation, having access to image capabilities could further enhance the training process. With image capabilities, the system could potentially provide visual aids, diagrams, or interactive images to supplement the instructions and make the training more engaging and effective.
