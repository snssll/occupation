1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of reviewing materials to ensure regulatory agency requirements are met as a Regulatory Affairs Manager, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it. 

- The task involves reviewing materials such as marketing literature or user manuals to ensure compliance with regulatory agency requirements. This task primarily requires understanding regulatory guidelines, analyzing documents, and ensuring adherence to specific regulations.
- The LLM can assist by providing information on current regulatory requirements, helping to interpret complex regulations, and suggesting edits to ensure compliance.
- The LLM can also generate summaries of regulatory documents, provide explanations of regulatory terms, and offer insights into best practices for compliance.

Considering these points, the task can benefit significantly from the LLM's capabilities in providing information, analyzing text, and generating summaries to aid Regulatory Affairs Managers in their review process.
