1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of recommending educational materials or resources to clients as a Credit Counselor, we need to consider the level of exposure to LLM. 

- E1: Direct exposure - If the task involves researching and providing recommendations based on existing knowledge and resources, the LLM could significantly reduce the time it takes to find relevant educational materials or resources. The LLM can assist in summarizing information, generating suggestions, and even drafting communication to clients.
- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the task may not require highly specialized domain knowledge, having access to additional software that can retrieve up-to-date financial information, analyze data to inform decisions, and provide counsel could further enhance the efficiency of the Credit Counselor in recommending resources.
- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Since the task primarily involves recommending educational materials or resources related to financial planning, budgeting, or credit, image capabilities would not significantly impact the completion of this task.
