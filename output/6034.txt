1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of editing or rewriting existing written material as necessary, and submitting it for approval, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves working with written text, making revisions, and seeking approval from supervisors or editors. The LLM can assist in providing edits to existing text following specific instructions, which aligns with tasks that fall under E1 exposure. The model can help in transforming text, providing feedback on documents, and maintaining records of written data, all of which are relevant to the task of editing written material. Therefore, based on the LLM's ability to assist in these text-related tasks, the task of editing or rewriting written material can be classified as E1.
