1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of preparing and presenting summaries and analyses of survey data as a Survey Researcher, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be facilitated by the use of an LLM.

- The task involves processing survey data, creating tables, graphs, and fact sheets, and describing survey techniques and results. This task heavily relies on the ability to analyze and summarize information accurately.
- An LLM can assist in generating written content, summarizing data, and potentially even creating basic tables and graphs based on the input provided.
- While the LLM can help with writing text and potentially summarizing data, it may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task by half, as the task also involves organizing and presenting data visually in tables and graphs, which may require specialized software beyond the capabilities of the LLM alone.
- It is easy to imagine additional software that could be developed on top of the LLM to enhance its capabilities for data visualization and presentation, which could potentially reduce the time needed to complete the task by half.

Based on these considerations, the task of preparing and presenting summaries and analyses of survey data as a Survey Researcher falls under label E2 - Exposure by LLM-powered applications.
