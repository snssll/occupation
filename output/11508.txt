1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of performing integrated or computerized Geographic Information Systems (GIS) analyses, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves using GIS software to analyze geographic data to solve scientific problems. While the LLM can provide general information and potentially assist in understanding GIS concepts, it lacks the specific capabilities to directly perform GIS analyses. The task requires specialized knowledge of GIS software and techniques, which the LLM does not possess. Therefore, the task does not fall under E1, as the LLM alone cannot significantly reduce the time it takes to complete GIS analyses. Additionally, developing software on top of the LLM to perform GIS analyses would be complex and may not result in a significant time reduction, so it does not fit under E2 either. Since the task does not involve image capabilities or detailed visual analysis, it also does not fall under E3. Therefore, the most appropriate label for this task is E0.

2: E0

3: High
