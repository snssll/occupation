1: In this task, an Instructional Coordinator is required to address public audiences to explain program objectives and elicit support. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves communicating with public audiences, which requires effective verbal communication skills, the ability to tailor messages to different audiences, and engage in persuasive communication. While an LLM could potentially assist in generating speech content or providing guidance on effective communication strategies, the task primarily involves in-person interaction and public speaking, which are not areas where the LLM can directly assist. Therefore, the task does not involve text input or output that can be significantly enhanced by the LLM. As a result, this task falls under E0 as it does not meet the criteria for exposure to LLM capabilities.
