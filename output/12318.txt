1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of preparing and delivering presentations as an Environmental Economist, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it. 

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** The LLM could assist in writing and refining the content of the presentations based on economic and environmental study results, policy recommendations, and environmental consequences. It can help in structuring the information effectively, providing data-driven insights, and ensuring clarity in communication. The model can also generate potential questions that the audience might have, helping to anticipate and address concerns during the presentation.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time it takes to prepare and deliver presentations, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to streamline the process. For example, specialized tools could be created to summarize complex economic and environmental data, generate visual aids, or even provide real-time feedback on presentation delivery.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Image capabilities would not have a significant impact on preparing and delivering presentations in this context. While visual aids are important in presentations, the task primarily involves communicating economic and environmental study results through spoken and written content rather than detailed image creation or analysis.
