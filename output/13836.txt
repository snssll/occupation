In this case, the task involves processing information, evaluating its relevance, and generating ideas based on the input received. The LLM can assist in providing relevant information, summarizing data, generating questions, and even suggesting potential story angles based on the input provided. The LLM can also help in researching background information on leads or tips. While the LLM cannot provide real-time updates or access up-to-date facts without them being explicitly mentioned in the input, it can still significantly aid in the initial stages of story development.
