1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of prescribing medications to treat patients with erectile dysfunction (ED), infertility, or ejaculation problems as a Urologist, we need to consider the nature of the task and the potential for LLM exposure to assist in completing it.

- The task involves medical decision-making based on patient symptoms and history, which requires specialized knowledge and expertise.
- The task also involves prescribing medications, which involves considering various factors such as drug interactions, side effects, and patient-specific conditions.
- While the LLM can provide general information about these conditions and medications, it cannot replace the specialized medical knowledge and training required to diagnose and treat patients effectively.
- The task does not involve text generation, summarization, or data analysis that could significantly benefit from LLM capabilities.

Based on these considerations, the task of prescribing medications as a Urologist falls under E0 as it requires specialized medical expertise and human judgment that cannot be effectively replaced or significantly assisted by the LLM.
