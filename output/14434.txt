1: In this task, a Mechanical Door Repairer is required to remove or disassemble defective automatic mechanical door closers using hand tools. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves physical work that requires manual dexterity and knowledge of mechanical systems. It does not involve writing, summarizing, analyzing text, or any other activity that an LLM could directly assist with. The task is hands-on and requires physical interaction with mechanical components, which cannot be replaced by the capabilities of an LLM. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM.
