1: In this task, a Helper-Roofer is responsible for covering roofs with layers of roofing felt or asphalt strips before installing various roofing materials. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the complexity of the task and the potential for automation using the LLM. 

- The task involves physical labor and hands-on work, which cannot be directly automated by the LLM.
- While the LLM could potentially provide information on roofing materials, techniques, or safety guidelines, it cannot physically perform the task of covering roofs with roofing felt or asphalt strips.
- The task does not involve written or spoken communication that could be significantly enhanced by the LLM.
- There are no specific documents, data, or specialized knowledge retrieval required for this task that would benefit from LLM capabilities.

Based on these considerations, the task of covering roofs with roofing materials is best classified as E0 - No exposure to LLM.
