1: For the task of making travel arrangements for office personnel as an Office Clerk, General, the exposure to LLM can be evaluated as follows:

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM can assist in generating travel itineraries, booking flights, hotels, and transportation, and providing information on travel restrictions or requirements. It can also help in communicating with travel agencies or companies via written correspondence to finalize arrangements.
- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time to complete this task, additional software could be developed to integrate with the LLM for more efficient retrieval of travel-related information, real-time updates on travel advisories, and automated booking processes.
- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities would not significantly impact the task of making travel arrangements, as it primarily involves text-based information and communication with travel service providers.

Based on the above analysis, the task of making travel arrangements for office personnel as an Office Clerk, General would likely fall under E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications.
