1: In this task, the tutor is required to review class material with students by discussing text, working solutions to problems, or reviewing worksheets or other assignments. With the help of the LLM, the tutor could potentially generate additional explanations, examples, or summaries of the material to aid in the review process. The LLM could also assist in creating practice problems or providing alternative perspectives on the content. However, the task primarily involves direct interaction with students, which may not be significantly enhanced by the LLM. While the LLM could provide supplementary materials, the core aspect of tutoring—engaging with students in real-time and tailoring explanations to their individual needs—cannot be fully automated by the LLM.
