1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of providing technical or administrative support for sustainability programs or issues as a Sustainability Specialist, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be impacted by the use of the LLM.

- This task involves tasks such as researching, analyzing data, preparing reports, and providing support for sustainability initiatives.
- The LLM can assist in researching and providing information on sustainability programs, policies, and best practices.
- The LLM can help in summarizing reports, generating insights, and potentially even drafting documents related to sustainability.
- While the LLM can provide information and support in a written format, it may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task by half, as the task may involve a significant amount of human judgment, decision-making, and interaction beyond just text-based information retrieval.
