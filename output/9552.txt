1: In this task, the helper production worker is responsible for marking or tagging identification on parts. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the complexity of the task and whether the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete it with high quality.

- The task of marking or tagging identification on parts is a straightforward and manual process that does not involve complex decision-making or specialized knowledge.
- The LLM could potentially assist by providing guidance on the specific format or content of the identification marks or tags.
- However, since this task primarily involves physical actions such as marking or tagging, and does not heavily rely on text-based instructions or analysis, the LLM may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task.

Based on these considerations, the task of marking or tagging identification on parts would likely fall under E0 as the LLM would not substantially decrease the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete the task.

2: E0

3: Moderate
