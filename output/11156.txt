1: In this task, a Furniture Finisher is required to paint metal surfaces electrostatically or using painting equipment. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality. 

- The task involves physical work that cannot be directly performed by the LLM.
- The LLM cannot interact with physical tools like spray guns or painting equipment.
- The task requires hands-on skills and precision that the LLM cannot provide.
- The LLM cannot make decisions based on visual inspection of surfaces or adjust painting techniques based on real-time feedback.

Based on these considerations, it is clear that the task of painting metal surfaces as a Furniture Finisher falls under E0 as it involves physical work and precision that the LLM cannot perform.

2: E0

3: High
