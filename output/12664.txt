1: In this task, a Licensed Practical or Licensed Vocational Nurse is responsible for preparing patients for examinations, tests, or treatments and explaining procedures to them. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves communication, explanation, and patient care, which are primarily text-based activities. An LLM could potentially assist in generating standardized explanations for procedures, providing information on common examinations or tests, and helping draft patient education materials. The LLM could also aid in summarizing patient information or generating responses to common patient queries. However, the task also involves hands-on patient care, which cannot be directly assisted by an LLM. Therefore, while the LLM can provide some support in the form of text generation and information retrieval, it cannot significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task due to the hands-on nature of patient preparation. As a result, this task falls under E0 as the LLM cannot reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete the task with high quality by at least half.
