1: In this task, a Hoist and Winch Operator is required to repair, maintain, and adjust equipment using hand tools. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. Repairing, maintaining, and adjusting equipment using hand tools involves physical manipulation of machinery and tools, which cannot be directly performed by an LLM. The task does not involve writing, summarizing, analyzing text, or any other activity that an LLM could assist with. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM.

2: E0
