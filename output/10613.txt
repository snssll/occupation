1: In this task, a Fishing and Hunting Worker needs to obtain permission from landowners to hunt or trap on their land. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves communication skills, negotiation, and potentially legal considerations. While an LLM could potentially assist in drafting communication or providing guidance on negotiation tactics, it cannot directly interact with landowners or make decisions on behalf of the worker. Therefore, the task does not align well with the capabilities of the LLM in a way that would significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with high quality. As a result, this task falls under E0 as it does not meet the criteria for exposure to LLM capabilities.

2: E0

3: High
