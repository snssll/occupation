1: In this task, a Speech-Language Pathologist is required to participate in conferences, training, continuing education courses, or publish research results to share knowledge of new hearing or speech disorder treatment methods or technologies. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves sharing knowledge and research results, which can be done effectively through written communication.
- The LLM can assist in drafting research papers, summarizing information for presentations, or even generating questions for training sessions.
- The LLM can help in preparing training materials based on general knowledge or even specialized knowledge related to speech disorders.
- The task does not involve detailed visuals or precise measurements, making it suitable for text-based assistance.

Based on these considerations, the task can be significantly expedited with the help of the LLM, reducing the time required to prepare for conferences, training, or research publications.
