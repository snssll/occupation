1: In this task, the occupation involves pouring, packing, spreading, or pressing materials into or around models or molds. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality. The task itself is very hands-on and physical, involving manual labor and precise techniques to work with materials like plaster and concrete. The task does not involve text input or output, and the context is primarily focused on physical actions rather than information processing. Therefore, the task does not align with the capabilities of the LLM, as it cannot perform physical actions or interact with physical materials.
