1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of mixing water and detergents or acids to prepare cleaning solutions as a Janitor or Cleaner, I will consider the following:

- This task involves a specific set of instructions that can be followed step by step.
- The task does not require up-to-date information or specialized domain knowledge beyond basic cleaning procedures.
- The task does not involve complex decision-making or analysis beyond following specified instructions.
- The task is primarily text-based and does not require image capabilities.

Based on these considerations, it is clear that the task of mixing cleaning solutions aligns with the E0 label. The task does not significantly benefit from the use of an LLM or any additional software beyond what is commonly available for completing such a task.

2: E0

3: High
