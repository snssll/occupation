1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of interpreting results of financial analysis procedures as a Financial Quantitative Analyst, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be aided by the use of a large language model (LLM).

- Financial analysis involves complex data interpretation, which can benefit from the LLM's ability to process and analyze large amounts of text data.
- The LLM can assist in providing insights, explanations, and context to the results obtained from financial analysis procedures, enhancing the analyst's understanding and decision-making process.
- The task does not involve precise measurements or detailed visuals that would require hands-on interaction, making it suitable for text-based analysis and interpretation.

Based on these considerations, the task of interpreting results of financial analysis procedures as a Financial Quantitative Analyst would likely fall under E1 - Direct exposure. The LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to analyze and interpret financial data, providing valuable insights and explanations to the analyst.
