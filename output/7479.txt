1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of identifying or creating new sustainability indicators as a Sustainability Specialist, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be completed with the help of an LLM.

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** If the task involves researching existing sustainability indicators, understanding the context of sustainability, and generating new indicators based on that knowledge, the LLM could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task. The LLM can provide information on current sustainability trends, best practices, and existing indicators, which can aid in the creation of new indicators. Additionally, the LLM can assist in drafting reports or documentation related to the new indicators.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the LLM alone may not reduce the time to complete the task by half, additional software built on top of the LLM could enhance the process. For example, a specialized tool that can analyze large datasets related to sustainability, extract relevant information, and suggest potential indicators could be developed. This tool, in combination with the LLM, could streamline the indicator creation process.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Image capabilities are not directly relevant to the task of identifying or creating new sustainability indicators. This task primarily involves text-based research, analysis, and decision-making related to sustainability concepts and indicators.
