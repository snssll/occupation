1: In this task, the Loan Interviewers and Clerks are responsible for interviewing loan applicants to gather personal and financial information and help them complete loan applications. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves interacting with individuals, asking specific questions, and assisting in paperwork completion. While an LLM could potentially assist in generating questions to ask applicants or providing guidance on common financial data required for loan applications, the task primarily involves human interaction and document processing, which may not be significantly expedited by the LLM. Therefore, the task does not seem to align with the capabilities of the LLM to the extent that it would reduce the time significantly for an experienced worker.
