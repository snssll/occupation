1: In this task, a Video Game Designer is responsible for overseeing gameplay testing to ensure the intended gaming experience and game adherence to the original vision. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it. 

- E0: This task involves overseeing gameplay testing, which requires human judgment, interaction, and decision-making based on real-time feedback from testers. The task also involves ensuring the gaming experience aligns with the original vision, which may involve creative input and understanding of game design principles. The LLM, even with its capabilities, cannot replace the need for human oversight and decision-making in this context.

- E1: While the LLM could potentially assist in generating documentation, reports, or guidelines related to gameplay testing based on provided information, it cannot directly oversee the testing process or ensure the gaming experience aligns with the original vision. The task involves real-time interaction, feedback, and decision-making that are beyond the capabilities of the LLM.

- E2: It is conceivable that software could be developed on top of the LLM to analyze gameplay testing data, provide insights, or generate reports based on testing outcomes. However, the core task of overseeing gameplay testing and ensuring the gaming experience aligns with the original vision still heavily relies on human judgment, creativity, and interaction, which the LLM alone cannot fully address.

- E3: The task does not involve image processing, creation, or analysis that would require additional image capabilities beyond the LLM's text-based capabilities.
