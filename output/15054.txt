This task involves analyzing financial information, assessing credit risk, and making decisions based on the information available. With the help of a large language model (LLM), the process of reviewing customer files and identifying delinquent accounts can be significantly expedited. The LLM can assist in summarizing customer files, extracting relevant information, and even providing recommendations based on the data analyzed. By using the LLM, the task can be completed more efficiently and accurately, reducing the time required for manual review and analysis.
