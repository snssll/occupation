1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of producing pharmaceutically or industrially useful proteins using recombinant DNA technology as a Biochemist or Biophysicist, we need to consider the level of exposure to LLM.

- E1: Direct exposure - The task involves a specific scientific process that can benefit from the LLM's ability to provide information, explanations, and guidance on recombinant DNA technology and protein production. The LLM can assist in writing and transforming text to explain the steps involved, provide edits to existing protocols, and answer questions related to the process.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time to complete the task, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to summarize complex scientific documents, retrieve up-to-date information on protein production techniques, and provide recommendations based on data analysis.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not directly relevant to the task of producing proteins using recombinant DNA technology. Therefore, this task does not fall under E3.

Based on the above analysis, the task of producing pharmaceutically or industrially useful proteins using recombinant DNA technology as a Biochemist or Biophysicist is best classified as E1: Direct exposure.

2: E1

3: Moderate
