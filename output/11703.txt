1: In this task, a Speech-Language Pathology Assistant is required to perform support duties such as preparing materials, keeping records, maintaining supplies, and scheduling activities. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves a lot of administrative work that can be time-consuming but does not require specialized domain knowledge beyond general administrative skills.
- The task does not involve complex decision-making or analysis that would benefit significantly from the capabilities of an LLM.
- While the LLM could potentially assist in generating written materials or providing information on best practices for record-keeping, the task itself is more about practical support duties rather than information processing or decision-making.

Based on these considerations, the task of performing support duties for Speech-Language Pathology Assistants is best classified as E0 - No exposure.
