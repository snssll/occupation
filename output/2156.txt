1: In this task, the occupation of Fallers involves clearing brush from work areas, cutting saplings, and trees using tools like axes, chainsaws, or bulldozers. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM could significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality. 

- The task involves physical labor and operating heavy machinery, which cannot be replaced by text-based tools like the LLM.
- The task requires hands-on skills and knowledge of operating equipment safely, which the LLM cannot provide.
- The task involves working in outdoor environments, assessing risks, and making real-time decisions, which are beyond the capabilities of the LLM.
- The task does not involve text-based information processing or decision-making that could benefit from the LLM's capabilities.

Based on these considerations, it is clear that the task of Fallers does not have exposure to the LLM as it involves physical work and specialized skills that cannot be replaced by text-based tools.
