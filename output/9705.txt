1: In this task, a carpet installer is required to measure, cut, and install tackless strips along the baseboard or wall. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves physical work that requires precise measurements and manual labor. It does not involve text input or output, and the context is based on physical dimensions and materials. The task cannot be completed solely by writing or transforming text using an LLM. Therefore, the task does not fall under E1, E2, or E3 categories as it does not involve text-based input or output, and it requires physical actions that cannot be replaced by an LLM.
