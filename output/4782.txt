1: In this task, a Rehabilitation Counselor is required to develop and maintain relationships with community referral sources, such as schools or community groups. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes for a worker to complete this task with high quality. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM could potentially assist in drafting emails, summarizing information for meetings, or providing guidance on how to approach different community groups. It could also help in generating questions or responses for communication with these sources.
- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not reduce the time significantly for this task, additional software could be developed to help in summarizing information about community groups, providing recommendations on how to maintain relationships effectively, or analyzing data to inform decisions related to community outreach.
- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities would not be relevant for this task as it primarily involves text-based communication and relationship-building with community referral sources.
