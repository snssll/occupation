1: In this task, the Fish and Game Wardens are responsible for issuing licenses, permits, or other documentation related to fishing, hunting, and wildlife conservation. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes for a Fish and Game Warden to complete the task of issuing licenses and permits. 

- E0: This task involves legal documentation and potentially sensitive information that may require human judgment and interaction. The task may also involve verifying specific details and ensuring compliance with regulations, which may not be easily automated by the LLM alone.

- E1: While the LLM could potentially assist in drafting standard templates for licenses and permits, the task of issuing these documents may still require human oversight, verification, and decision-making that cannot be entirely automated by the LLM. The complexity of legal requirements and the need for accuracy in issuing such documents may limit the extent to which the LLM can directly reduce the time needed to complete the task.

- E2: It is conceivable that additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to streamline the process of issuing licenses and permits by automating certain aspects such as data entry, template generation, and basic document drafting. This software could potentially integrate with existing databases to retrieve relevant information and ensure compliance with regulations, thereby reducing the time needed to complete the task.

- E3: The task of issuing licenses and permits may not benefit significantly from image capabilities, as it primarily involves text-based documentation and legal requirements. Image capabilities would not provide substantial advantages in this context.
