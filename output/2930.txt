1: In this task, an Airfield Operations Specialist is required to conduct inspections of the airport property and perimeter to maintain controlled access to airfields. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves physical inspection of the airport property and perimeter, which cannot be directly assisted by the LLM. The task requires on-site presence, observation, and interaction with the physical environment, making it unsuitable for automation through text-based tools like the LLM. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM or any tools built on top of it.
