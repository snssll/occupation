1: In this task, the occupation involves painting, coating, and decorating workers who are responsible for melting or heating coating materials to specified temperatures. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone or with additional software could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality.

- E0: This task involves physical actions such as melting or heating coating materials to specified temperatures, which cannot be directly performed by the LLM or any software tool. The task also requires precise measurements and physical handling, making it unsuitable for automation by the LLM.

- E1: The task of melting or heating coating materials to specified temperatures is a hands-on activity that cannot be directly translated into text-based instructions for the LLM to execute. The LLM lacks the capability to physically interact with materials or equipment, so it cannot directly assist in completing this task.

- E2: While it is conceivable that specialized software could be developed to assist painting, coating, and decorating workers by providing recommendations on optimal heating or melting temperatures based on data inputs, the task itself still heavily relies on physical actions and specialized knowledge that go beyond the capabilities of the LLM alone.

- E3: The task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images, so the image capabilities of the LLM are not relevant in this context.

2: E0

3: High
