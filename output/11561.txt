1: In this task, the Audio and Video Technicians are required to perform narration of productions or present announcements. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The LLM can generate text based on input and can assist in writing scripts or text for narration. It can also help in refining the language used in announcements. However, the task specifically involves audio and video elements, which the LLM alone cannot handle. While the LLM can assist in generating the text for narration, the actual recording and production of audio and video content require specialized equipment and skills beyond the capabilities of the LLM. Therefore, the task does not significantly benefit from direct access to the LLM, as the core components of the task are outside the LLM's capabilities.
