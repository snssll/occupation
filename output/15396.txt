1: In this task, a cook in a restaurant is required to season and cook food according to recipes or personal judgment and experience. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves practical, hands-on skills such as seasoning and cooking food, which are not text-based activities that can be directly assisted by an LLM. The task also heavily relies on sensory perceptions like taste, smell, and texture, which cannot be replicated by an LLM. Therefore, the task of seasoning and cooking food does not align with the capabilities of an LLM, and there is no way for the LLM to significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task.
