1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of conducting or coordinating audits of company accounts and financial transactions as a Treasurer or Controller, we need to consider the level of exposure to LLM.

- This task involves analyzing financial data, ensuring compliance with regulations, and conducting audits, which are all activities that can benefit from the LLM's ability to process and analyze large amounts of text data.
- The LLM can assist in summarizing financial documents, providing insights into regulatory requirements, and generating reports based on the analysis of financial transactions.
- While the task may involve some level of human judgment and interpretation, the LLM can significantly reduce the time required to gather information, analyze data, and generate reports related to audits and compliance.

Based on these considerations, the task of conducting or coordinating audits of company accounts and financial transactions as a Treasurer or Controller would likely fall under the label E1 - Direct exposure.
