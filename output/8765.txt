1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of laying out, measuring, and marking dimensions on material as a Sheet Metal Worker, we need to consider how the task can be completed with the help of an LLM. In this case, the task involves physical actions such as using calculators, scribes, dividers, squares, or rulers to mark dimensions on material. These actions require manual dexterity and precision, which cannot be directly replaced by text-based instructions or responses from an LLM. The task also involves working with physical materials, which are outside the scope of what an LLM can directly interact with. Therefore, the task does not fall under E1, E2, or E3 exposure categories as it does not involve text-based interactions or image capabilities that could be enhanced by an LLM.
