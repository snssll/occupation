1: In this task, the occupation involves Recycling and Reclamation Workers who operate automated refuse or manual recycling collection vehicles. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if access to the LLM or LLM-powered tools can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality.

- E0: This task involves physical work that cannot be automated by the LLM. It requires hands-on operation of vehicles, which is not something the LLM can assist with.
- E1: The task does not involve writing, transforming text, or any other text-based activities that the LLM can directly assist with. Therefore, direct access to the LLM would not reduce the time it takes to complete this task.
- E2: While it's conceivable that software could be developed to optimize routes or schedules for collection vehicles, the core task of physically operating the vehicles cannot be significantly aided by the LLM alone.
- E3: The task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images, so the image capabilities of the LLM are not relevant here.

Based on the above analysis, the most appropriate label for this task is E0.

2: E0

3: High
