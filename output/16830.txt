1: In this task, the Low Vision Therapists, Orientation and Mobility Specialists, and Vision Rehabilitation Therapists are required to teach self-advocacy skills to their clients. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. Teaching self-advocacy skills involves a significant amount of human interaction, personalized guidance, and emotional support tailored to the individual needs of each client. This task does not involve writing, summarizing, analyzing text, or any other activity that an LLM could directly assist with. The task also does not involve the use of images or any specialized domain knowledge that an LLM could provide. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM or any tools built on top of it.
