1: In this task, a Continuous Mining Machine Operator is responsible for scraping or washing conveyors to minimize dust production. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. This task involves manual labor and physical interaction with machinery, specifically in the context of mining operations. The task does not involve complex text-based instructions, data analysis, or decision-making that could be significantly enhanced by an LLM. The task is hands-on and requires physical presence and action, which cannot be replaced by text-based AI tools. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM or any tools built on top of it.

2: E0
