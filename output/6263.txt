1: In this task, a Traffic Technician is responsible for establishing procedures for street closures or for repair or construction projects. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves creating and documenting specific procedures, which can be text-based and require clear communication.
- The task may involve some level of research or referencing existing guidelines or regulations.
- The task does not involve highly specialized domain knowledge beyond traffic management and construction regulations.
- The task does not require image capabilities for completion.

Based on these considerations, the task of establishing procedures for street closures or construction projects could benefit from the use of an LLM to assist in drafting clear and detailed procedures based on existing guidelines and regulations. The LLM can help in generating text, providing examples, and ensuring the procedures are comprehensive and well-structured.
