1: Critical Care Nurses are responsible for setting up and monitoring various medical equipment and devices to ensure the proper care and treatment of critically ill patients. This task involves technical knowledge and expertise in handling complex medical devices. To determine the appropriate exposure label for this task in relation to the LLM, we need to consider whether the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes for a Critical Care Nurse to set up and monitor medical equipment and devices with equivalent quality.

- E0: This task involves hands-on interaction with medical equipment and devices, which requires physical presence and specialized training. The LLM alone cannot replace the practical skills and real-time monitoring needed for this task.

- E1: While the LLM can provide information on medical equipment and devices, it cannot physically set up or monitor them in real-time. The task requires practical skills and immediate responsiveness, which the LLM cannot replicate.

- E2: It is conceivable that additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to provide guidance or information on specific medical equipment and devices, potentially streamlining the process for Critical Care Nurses. This software could offer quick access to manuals, troubleshooting tips, or best practices related to the equipment.

- E3: With image capabilities, the LLM could potentially assist in identifying medical equipment and devices from images or diagrams, providing visual aids or instructions for setting up and monitoring. However, the limitations of not being able to physically interact with the equipment still apply.
