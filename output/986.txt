1: In this task, a Buyer and Purchasing Agent for Farm Products is responsible for arranging transportation or storage of purchased products. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone or with additional software could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task.

- E0: This task involves practical logistics and coordination that may require direct human interaction, precise measurements, and real-time decision-making. The LLM and any tools built on top of it cannot physically arrange transportation or storage, so this task is unlikely to be significantly expedited by LLM capabilities.

- E1: While the LLM could potentially assist in drafting emails or written communications related to transportation or storage arrangements, the core task of physically arranging transportation or storage is not something the LLM can directly perform. The time saved by using the LLM for communication aspects may not be substantial enough to warrant an E1 label.

- E2: It is conceivable that specialized software could be developed on top of the LLM to help Buyers and Purchasing Agents in this field. For example, a tool that can search for transportation providers, compare storage options, or provide recommendations based on data analysis. Such software could streamline the decision-making process and save time, but as of now, this software does not exist.

- E3: The task does not involve image processing or detailed visual analysis, so the image capabilities of the LLM are not relevant in this context.

2: E0
