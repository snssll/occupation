1: In this task, the worker needs to verify the alignment of workpieces on machines using measuring instruments. This task involves precision and accuracy in measurements, which may not be directly aided by the LLM. The LLM does not have the capability to provide physical measurements or interact with physical objects. While the LLM could potentially provide information on how to use measuring instruments or general guidance on alignment techniques, it cannot directly assist in the physical verification of workpiece alignment. Therefore, this task does not seem to benefit from LLM exposure.
