1: In this task, an Industrial-Organizational Psychologist is responsible for developing interview techniques, rating scales, and psychological tests for assessing skills, abilities, and interests in the context of employee selection, placement, or promotion. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- Developing interview techniques, rating scales, and psychological tests involves a significant amount of text-based work, such as writing questions, designing assessment tools, and creating evaluation criteria.
- The task does not involve precise measurements or detailed visuals that would require hands-on interaction.
- The task relies heavily on written communication and knowledge in the field of psychology and human resources.
- While the task may benefit from specialized domain knowledge, the core of the work involves text-based tasks that can be supported by an LLM.

Based on these considerations, the task of developing interview techniques, rating scales, and psychological tests for employee assessment falls under E1 - Direct exposure to the LLM.
