1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of evaluating new emerging media or technologies and making recommendations for their application within Internet marketing or search marketing campaigns as a Search Marketing Strategist, we need to consider the nature of the task and the potential impact of using an LLM.

- This task involves researching and analyzing new technologies and media in the context of marketing campaigns. An LLM could assist in gathering information about these emerging technologies and media, providing insights into their applications in marketing campaigns, and generating recommendations based on the data analyzed.
- The LLM can help in summarizing information about various technologies and media, providing recommendations based on the data available, and potentially even predicting trends in the industry.
- While the LLM can assist in generating recommendations, the final decision-making process may still require human judgment and expertise, especially in the dynamic field of marketing where creativity and strategic thinking play crucial roles.
- The task does not involve precise measurements, detailed visuals, or physical interactions, making it suitable for LLM assistance.

Based on these considerations, the task aligns with E2 - Exposure by LLM-powered applications. While the LLM alone may not reduce the time to complete the task by half, additional software built on top of the LLM could enhance the efficiency of researching, analyzing, and recommending emerging technologies for marketing campaigns.
