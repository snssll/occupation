1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of examining commercial sites to assess the feasibility of installing equipment for reducing electricity consumption during peak demand periods, we need to consider the level of assistance the LLM can provide in completing this task.

- The task involves examining commercial sites, which may require physical presence and interaction with the environment. This physical aspect indicates that the task may not be easily reducible to text-based instructions for the LLM to complete.
- Assessing the feasibility of installing equipment involves technical knowledge about building management systems and energy efficiency, which the LLM can provide information on but may not have the practical experience to assess on-site conditions.
- The task also involves evaluating the potential impact of the equipment on electricity consumption during peak demand periods, which may require real-time data analysis and interaction with stakeholders, beyond the capabilities of the LLM.

Considering these factors, it is unlikely that the LLM alone or with additional software could significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced energy auditor to complete this task with high quality. Therefore, this task is best classified as E0 - No exposure.

2: E0

3: High
