1: In this task, an Information Security Engineer is required to develop response and recovery strategies for security breaches. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we can break down the task as follows:

- Writing and transforming text: The task involves creating detailed strategies in response to security breaches, which can be effectively done using text input and output with the LLM.
- Providing edits to existing text: The engineer may need to revise and refine the strategies based on feedback or new information, which can be facilitated by the LLM.
- Analyzing written information to inform decisions: The engineer will need to analyze various factors related to security breaches to develop effective strategies, a task that can be supported by the LLM's capabilities.

Considering these points, the task can benefit significantly from direct access to the LLM, as it involves writing, editing, and analyzing text to develop security strategies.
