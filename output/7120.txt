1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of "Gather and empty trash" for Janitors and Cleaners, Except Maids and Housekeeping Cleaners, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be impacted by the use of the LLM.

- The task of gathering and emptying trash is a physical task that involves manual labor and does not inherently involve complex decision-making or information processing that could be significantly enhanced by the LLM.
- The task does not require text input or output, and the context is straightforward and does not require extensive analysis or interpretation.
- While the LLM could potentially provide general information or guidelines on waste management practices, the task itself is primarily practical and manual in nature, which limits the direct applicability of the LLM.

Based on these considerations, the task of "Gather and empty trash" for Janitors and Cleaners, Except Maids and Housekeeping Cleaners would likely fall under the E0 category as it does not significantly benefit from the capabilities of the LLM in terms of reducing time or improving quality.
