1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of providing customers with product samples and catalogs as a Sales Representative, Wholesale and Manufacturing, Except Technical and Scientific Products, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be facilitated by the use of an LLM.

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** If the task involves writing and transforming text (e.g., creating product descriptions), providing edits to existing text (e.g., updating catalogs), or answering questions about products based on information in the catalogs, then direct access to the LLM could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality. The LLM could assist in generating product descriptions, updating catalog information, or responding to customer inquiries efficiently.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the task of providing customers with product samples and catalogs may not be directly reducible to text-based interactions, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to streamline the process. For example, an application could be created to automatically generate personalized product catalogs based on customer preferences or to provide real-time product recommendations to customers. Such software could enhance the efficiency of the sales process.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Since the task involves providing product samples and catalogs, which may include visual elements, having access to image capabilities in addition to the LLM could further streamline the task. The system could assist in creating or editing digital images of products for catalogs, enhancing the visual appeal of the materials provided to customers.
