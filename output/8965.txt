1: In this task, a security guard is required to lock doors and gates of entrances and exits to secure buildings. This task involves a straightforward and routine action that does not require complex decision-making or specialized knowledge beyond basic security procedures. The task does not involve any interaction with the LLM or require any text input or output. Therefore, there is no clear way in which the LLM or any tools built on top of it could significantly reduce the time it takes for a security guard to complete this task. As such, this task falls under E0 as it does not benefit from exposure to the LLM.
