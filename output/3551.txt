1: In this task, the commercial pilot needs to contact control towers for various instructions and information using radio equipment. With the help of an LLM, the pilot could potentially draft the communication messages more efficiently, ensuring clarity and accuracy in the information conveyed. The LLM could assist in composing the messages, summarizing key points, and even suggesting appropriate language for different scenarios. This would save time for the pilot in crafting these communications, allowing them to focus more on the actual flying tasks. Therefore, this task could be categorized as E1 as the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality.
