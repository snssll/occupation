1: In this task, a First-Line Supervisor of Non-Retail Sales Workers is required to analyze details of sales territories to assess growth potential and set quotas. This task involves data analysis, decision-making, and setting targets based on the analysis. With access to the powerful OpenAI large language model (LLM), the supervisor could potentially input the details of sales territories, receive insights on growth potential, and even get suggestions on setting quotas based on the analysis provided by the LLM. The LLM could assist in processing and interpreting the data, providing recommendations, and potentially even generating reports based on the analysis. This task aligns with the capabilities of the LLM in analyzing written information to inform decisions and making recommendations given data or written input. Therefore, this task falls under E2 exposure as it could benefit from additional software developed on top of the LLM to further streamline the data analysis process and decision-making.
