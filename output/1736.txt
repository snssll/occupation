1: In this task, the Dining Room and Cafeteria Attendants and Bartender Helpers are responsible for carrying food, dishes, trays, or silverware from kitchens or supply departments to serving counters. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be significantly expedited or improved by using the language model. Since this task involves physical actions of carrying items, it does not directly involve text input or output that the LLM can assist with. The task does not require complex language processing, writing, summarizing, or any other text-related activities that the LLM excels at. Therefore, the task does not fall under E1, E2, or E3 categories.
