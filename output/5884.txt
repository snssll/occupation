1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of drawing charts and graphs to illustrate technical reports as a Financial and Investment Analyst or Financial Risk Specialist, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. In this case, the task involves creating visual representations based on data provided in the reports. The LLM itself does not have direct image creation capabilities, so it cannot generate charts or graphs directly. However, it can assist in analyzing the data, providing insights, and potentially suggesting trends or patterns that could be represented in the charts and graphs. 

Given that the LLM does not have direct image creation capabilities but can assist in data analysis and interpretation, this task falls under E2 exposure. While additional software could potentially be developed on top of the LLM to automate the process of creating charts and graphs based on the data and insights provided by the model, the current capabilities of the LLM alone do not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task.
