1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of compiling bibliographies of specialized materials for outside reading assignments for postsecondary teachers, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves research and organization of academic resources, which can be time-consuming and require expertise in various subject areas. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM can assist in researching and compiling bibliographies by providing relevant information on specialized materials based on the input provided. It can help in summarizing key points from various sources and generating a list of references. This would significantly reduce the time required for manual research and compilation.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone can assist in this task, additional software could be developed to enhance the process further. For example, a specialized tool could be created that retrieves up-to-date academic resources, organizes them based on subject areas, and generates comprehensive bibliographies automatically. Such a tool would streamline the process even more.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not relevant for this task as it primarily involves text-based research and compilation of bibliographies.

Considering the task's nature and the LLM's capabilities in assisting with research and text generation, the most appropriate label for this task is E1: Direct exposure.

2: E1

3: High certainty
