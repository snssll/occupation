1: In this task, an art therapist is required to establish goals or objectives for art therapy sessions in consultation with clients or site administrators. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves understanding the needs and preferences of clients, as well as collaborating with site administrators to align therapy goals with organizational objectives. The task primarily involves text-based communication, analysis of client information, and decision-making based on gathered information. 

Given that the task involves text-based communication and decision-making, the most suitable exposure label would be E1. The LLM can assist in generating potential therapy goals based on client information and organizational objectives, as well as help in formulating clear and concise communication with clients and administrators. The LLM can provide suggestions, insights, and language refinement to enhance the goal-setting process.
