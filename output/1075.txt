1: For the task of assembling new or reconditioned appliances as a Home Appliance Repairer, the exposure to LLM can be evaluated as follows:

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** The task of assembling appliances involves following specific instructions and procedures, which could potentially be aided by the LLM in providing step-by-step guidance or troubleshooting tips. The LLM could assist in generating text-based instructions or diagrams to aid in the assembly process, thereby reducing the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time it takes to assemble appliances, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to provide interactive guides, 3D assembly models, or real-time troubleshooting assistance. Such applications could enhance the efficiency and accuracy of the assembly process, making it easier to complete the task.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Image capabilities could potentially be useful in this task if the LLM could view and interpret images of appliance parts or assembly diagrams. This could aid in identifying components, verifying correct assembly, or providing visual cues during the process. However, the task primarily involves text-based instructions and physical assembly, so the impact of image capabilities may be limited.
