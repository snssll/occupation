1: In this task, a Drywall and Ceiling Tile Installer is required to measure and cut openings in panels or tiles for various fixtures. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be completed more efficiently with the help of the language model. Since this task involves physical measurements and cutting, it does not directly involve text input or output that the LLM can assist with. The LLM cannot perform physical tasks or provide real-time guidance for cutting materials. Therefore, the task does not align with the capabilities of the LLM, and no exposure level applies.

2: E0
