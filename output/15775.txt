1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of setting up and managing filing systems as a Secretary or Administrative Assistant, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be aided by the LLM. 

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** The task involves organizing and managing information, which can be greatly assisted by the LLM in tasks such as creating digital filing systems, updating records, and maintaining documents. The LLM can help in generating templates, organizing data, and providing suggestions for efficient filing systems based on the input provided.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the LLM can assist in organizing and managing information, the task of setting up and managing filing systems may not be significantly enhanced by additional software beyond what the LLM can directly offer. The LLM itself can handle text-based tasks related to document management effectively.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** This task does not involve detailed image processing or analysis, so the image capabilities of the LLM would not significantly impact the completion of the task.

Considering the above points, the task of setting up and managing filing systems as a Secretary or Administrative Assistant aligns most closely with **E1 (Direct exposure)** as the LLM can directly assist in organizing and managing information efficiently.
