1: In this task, the Electrical Engineer is required to develop software to control electrical systems. With the help of a large language model (LLM), the engineer can potentially write and transform code according to complex instructions, which is a task that can be significantly expedited by using the LLM. The LLM can assist in generating code snippets, providing insights into best practices, and offering solutions to coding challenges. This task involves writing code that can help perform a task that used to be done manually, which aligns with the capabilities of the LLM in assisting with coding tasks.
