1: In this task, a locksmith is required to cut new or duplicate keys using impressions or code key machines. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves a specific skill set and knowledge related to locksmithing, such as understanding key cutting techniques, machine operation, and key codes. While an LLM could potentially provide general information about key cutting, it may not have the specialized knowledge required to operate key cutting machines or understand specific key codes. Therefore, the task does not seem to align with the capabilities of the LLM in a way that would significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced locksmith to complete the task.
