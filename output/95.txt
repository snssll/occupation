1: In this task, the Electrical Power-Line Installers and Repairers need to adhere to safety practices and procedures, such as checking equipment regularly and erecting barriers around work areas. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be completed more efficiently with the help of the LLM. The task involves following established safety protocols and procedures, which are typically standardized and do not require complex decision-making or information retrieval beyond what is already known in the field. The task does not involve writing, summarizing documents, analyzing data, or any other text-based activities that could benefit significantly from LLM assistance. Therefore, the task does not align with any of the exposure levels that involve text-based tasks or data analysis.
