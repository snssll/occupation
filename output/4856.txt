1: In this task, a web developer is required to develop databases that support web applications and websites. To complete this task, the web developer needs to design, implement, and maintain databases that store and retrieve information for the web applications and sites. The task involves creating database schemas, writing queries, optimizing database performance, and ensuring data integrity. 

Considering the task description, the most relevant exposure label from the rubric would be E2 - Exposure by LLM-powered applications. While the LLM can assist in providing general information and guidance on database development concepts, it may not significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced web developer to design and implement databases for web applications. However, it is easy to imagine additional software built on top of the LLM that could streamline database development processes, provide recommendations on database design best practices, or offer insights on optimizing database performance.
