1: For the task of tutoring or assisting students individually or in small groups as a Short-Term Substitute Teacher, the exposure to LLM can be analyzed as follows:

- Direct exposure (E1): The task involves interacting with students, providing educational support, and adapting teaching methods based on individual needs. While the LLM can provide general information on teaching strategies, it may not be able to fully replace the personalized interaction and adaptability required in tutoring students. Therefore, the direct use of LLM may not significantly reduce the time needed to complete this task with equivalent quality.

- Exposure by LLM-powered applications (E2): It is conceivable that additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to assist Substitute Teachers in preparing customized lesson plans, accessing educational resources, or providing real-time feedback based on student responses. Such applications could potentially enhance the efficiency of tutoring sessions and improve the overall teaching experience. However, the current capabilities of the LLM alone may not be sufficient to significantly reduce the time required for tutoring students.

- Exposure given image capabilities (E3): Image capabilities would not have a direct impact on the task of tutoring or assisting students in this context. Since the task primarily involves verbal and written communication with students, the use of image capabilities would not provide a substantial advantage in completing the task.

Based on the analysis above, the task of tutoring or assisting students individually or in small groups as a Short-Term Substitute Teacher is best classified as Exposure by LLM-powered applications (E2).
