1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of designing structures for crop storage, animal shelter and loading, and animal and crop processing, and supervising their construction as an Agricultural Engineer, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be aided by the use of the LLM.

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** The task involves a significant amount of planning, design, and supervision, which can benefit from the LLM's capabilities in providing information, generating ideas, and assisting in decision-making processes related to agricultural engineering. The LLM can help in drafting design plans, providing insights on construction materials, offering suggestions for efficient structures, and even aiding in communication with construction teams.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the LLM can assist in generating text and providing information related to agricultural engineering, the task of supervising construction may require real-time decision-making and on-site assessments that the LLM alone may not be able to facilitate. However, additional software could be developed to integrate the LLM's capabilities with real-time monitoring tools or construction management systems to enhance the efficiency of supervision tasks.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** The task of designing structures may involve creating or editing digital images of the proposed structures. With access to image capabilities, the LLM could assist in visualizing the designs, creating digital representations of the structures, and potentially aiding in the communication of design ideas through images.

Based on the considerations above, the task of designing structures for crop storage, animal shelter and loading, and animal and crop processing, and supervising their construction as an Agricultural Engineer would likely fall under **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications)**.
