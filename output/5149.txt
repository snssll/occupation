1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of developing protocols to improve existing genetic techniques or to incorporate new diagnostic procedures as a Geneticist, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be aided by the use of a large language model (LLM).

- Geneticists typically rely on scientific knowledge, research papers, and existing protocols to develop new techniques or procedures. An LLM can assist in accessing a vast amount of scientific literature, research findings, and protocols to provide insights and suggestions for improving existing techniques or incorporating new diagnostic procedures.
- The task involves writing and transforming text to document the protocols, which aligns with the capabilities of an LLM in generating text based on specific instructions or requirements.
- While the task may require specialized domain knowledge in genetics, the LLM can still provide valuable information, suggestions, and references to enhance the protocols developed by the Geneticist.

Based on these considerations, the task of developing protocols to improve genetic techniques or incorporate new diagnostic procedures would fall under label E1 - Direct exposure.

2: E1

3: Moderate
