1: In this task, a stonemason is required to replace broken or missing masonry units in walls or floors. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. Since the task involves physical work such as handling masonry units, it cannot be directly completed using an LLM. The LLM does not have the capability to physically replace masonry units in walls or floors. Additionally, the task requires practical skills and knowledge of stonemasonry techniques, which are beyond the scope of what an LLM can provide. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it cannot be significantly expedited or completed by an LLM.

2: E0
