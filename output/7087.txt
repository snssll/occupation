1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of formulating or implementing regulatory affairs policies and procedures, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be supported by the capabilities of the LLM. 

- Regulatory affairs policies and procedures involve a significant amount of legal and regulatory knowledge, which the LLM can provide information on.
- The task may require analyzing complex regulations and guidelines, which the LLM can assist in summarizing and interpreting.
- The LLM can help in researching and staying up-to-date with regulatory changes and updates.
- The task may involve drafting written documents, which the LLM can assist in generating and editing.

Considering these points, the task of formulating or implementing regulatory affairs policies and procedures can benefit from the LLM's capabilities in providing information, summarizing content, and generating written materials. However, the task may also require specialized domain knowledge and expertise beyond what the LLM can provide, especially in interpreting and applying complex regulations.
