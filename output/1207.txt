1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of assigning duties to inmates and providing instructions as needed as a Correctional Officer or Jailer, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be supported by the capabilities of the LLM.

- The task involves assigning duties to inmates and providing instructions, which primarily requires written communication skills.
- The LLM can assist in generating written instructions, providing guidance on how to effectively communicate with inmates, and suggesting appropriate duties based on general knowledge.
- The LLM can also help in drafting reports or documentation related to the assigned duties and instructions.

Considering these points, the task can be significantly supported by the LLM in terms of generating written instructions, providing communication guidance, and assisting in documentation related to duties assigned to inmates. This support can reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality by at least half.
