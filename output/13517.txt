1: In this task, a Water/Wastewater Engineer is required to provide technical support on water resource or treatment issues to government agencies. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves providing technical support, which may require accessing and analyzing technical information related to water resources and treatment.
- The task involves communicating complex technical information to government agencies, which may involve writing reports, emails, or other forms of written communication.
- The task may involve researching and staying up-to-date on the latest developments in water resource management and treatment technologies.

Given these considerations, the task could benefit from the use of a large language model (LLM) to assist in researching, analyzing technical information, generating reports, and communicating effectively with government agencies. The LLM can help in summarizing information, drafting reports, and providing recommendations based on the latest knowledge available within its 2000-word context limit.
