1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of investigating or reporting questionable test results as a Quality Control Analyst, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be impacted by the use of an LLM.

- Quality Control Analysts typically need to review data, reports, and test results to ensure products meet quality standards. Investigating questionable test results involves analyzing data, identifying anomalies, and potentially taking corrective actions.
- With access to an LLM, a Quality Control Analyst could use the model to assist in analyzing test results, identifying patterns or discrepancies, and even generating reports based on the findings.
- The LLM could help in summarizing large amounts of data, providing insights into potential causes of questionable results, and even suggesting actions to take based on the analysis.
- While the LLM may not directly reduce the time it takes to investigate questionable test results by half, the development of specialized software that integrates the LLM's capabilities with data analysis tools could significantly streamline the process and enhance the accuracy of the analysis.

Based on these considerations, the task of investigating or reporting questionable test results as a Quality Control Analyst would likely fall under label E2 - Exposure by LLM-powered applications.
