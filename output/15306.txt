1: In this task, a curator is responsible for scheduling events and organizing various details such as refreshments, entertainment, decorations, and fee collection. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone or with additional software could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task.

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM could assist in generating event schedules, drafting communication materials, or providing suggestions for entertainment and decorations based on input criteria. It could also help in drafting emails for fee collection or creating event-related documents. Overall, the LLM could streamline the process of organizing events and managing details, potentially reducing the time needed for these tasks by at least half.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - Additional software built on top of the LLM could further enhance the capabilities for curators. For example, an application could automatically generate event schedules based on historical data, provide real-time updates on entertainment options, or suggest cost-effective decoration ideas. Such software could integrate with existing event management systems to streamline the entire process.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities would not significantly impact the task of scheduling events and organizing details, as the core requirements involve text-based information and logistical planning rather than image processing.

Based on the above analysis, the task of scheduling events and organizing details for curators aligns best with the E1 label as direct access to the LLM can enhance various aspects of the task and reduce the time required for completion.
