1: In this task, the Heavy and Tractor-Trailer Truck Driver is required to crank the trailer landing gear up or down to safely secure vehicles. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. This task involves a physical action of cranking the trailer landing gear, which cannot be directly performed by an LLM or any software tool. The task does not involve complex decision-making, analysis, or information retrieval that could benefit significantly from LLM capabilities. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM or any tools built on top of it.

2: E0
