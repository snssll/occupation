1: In this task, a recreation worker is required to confer with management to discuss and resolve participant complaints. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves communication, problem-solving, and conflict resolution skills, which are not directly related to text-based tasks that an LLM can assist with. The task does not involve writing, summarizing documents, providing feedback on documents, or any other text-based activities that an LLM could significantly expedite. Therefore, this task does not fall under E1, E2, or E3 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM or any potential software that could be developed on top of it.

2: E0

3: High
