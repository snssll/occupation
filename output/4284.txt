1: In this task, the occupation involves designing and creating glass objects using blowpipes and hand tools. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality. Since this task involves physical manipulation of materials and tools, it cannot be directly completed using the LLM. The LLM cannot perform physical tasks or interact with physical tools like blowpipes. Therefore, the task does not fall under E1, E2, or E3 categories as the LLM cannot assist in designing and creating physical glass objects.

2: E0

3: High
