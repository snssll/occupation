1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of advocating for individual or community health needs with government agencies or health service providers as a Community Health Worker, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be supported by the capabilities of the LLM.

- E1: Direct exposure - The task involves advocating for health needs, which requires a significant amount of written communication to convey concerns, proposals, and arguments effectively. The LLM can assist in drafting persuasive emails, letters, or reports to government agencies or health service providers. It can help in formulating clear and compelling arguments, providing relevant information, and structuring the communication effectively.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM can assist in generating written content for advocacy purposes, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to enhance its capabilities for this task. For example, specialized tools could be created to analyze policies, regulations, or health data to provide more targeted recommendations for advocacy efforts. These tools could integrate with the LLM to generate tailored advocacy materials based on specific contexts or requirements.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not directly relevant to the task of advocating for health needs with government agencies or health service providers. This task primarily involves written communication and interaction with stakeholders, rather than image processing or analysis.

Based on the above considerations, the task of advocating for individual or community health needs with government agencies or health service providers as a Community Health Worker is best classified as E1: Direct exposure.

2: E1

3: Moderate
