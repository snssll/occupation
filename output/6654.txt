1: In this task, a Construction and Building Inspector is required to examine lifting or conveying devices to ensure safety and proper functioning. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. This task involves physical inspection of equipment and requires hands-on assessment of safety mechanisms and functioning. The task does not involve text input or output, and the context is primarily based on physical inspection rather than textual information. As such, the task does not align with the capabilities of the LLM, which is focused on text-based tasks and does not have the ability to physically inspect equipment. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not benefit from the capabilities of the LLM.
