1: In this task, the Earth Driller is required to drive trucks, tractors, or truck-mounted drills to and from work sites. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality. Since this task involves physical driving and transportation, it does not directly involve text input or output that the LLM can assist with. The LLM cannot physically operate vehicles or perform tasks that require physical presence. Therefore, this task does not fall under E1, E2, or E3 exposure labels.

2: E0

3: High
