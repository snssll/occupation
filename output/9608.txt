1: In this task, a Highway Maintenance Worker is required to measure and mark locations for the installation of markers using tape, string, or chalk. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if access to the LLM or LLM-powered tools can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality.

- The task involves physical actions such as measuring and marking locations, which cannot be directly performed by the LLM.
- The task does not involve complex text input or output that would benefit from the LLM's language processing capabilities.
- There are no up-to-date facts or specialized domain knowledge required for this task that the LLM could provide.
- The task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images, so image capabilities are not relevant.

Based on these considerations, it is clear that the LLM or LLM-powered tools would not reduce the time it takes to complete this task for a Highway Maintenance Worker. Therefore, this task falls under label E0 - No exposure.

2: E0

3: High
