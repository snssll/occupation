1: In this task, the Solar Photovoltaic Installers are responsible for installing required labels on solar system components and hardware. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

Installing labels on solar system components involves physical work and precise placement, which cannot be done by an LLM. The task does not involve writing, summarizing, analyzing text, or any other activity that an LLM could directly assist with. Additionally, there are no up-to-date facts or specialized knowledge retrieval required for this task that an LLM could provide. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of an LLM.
