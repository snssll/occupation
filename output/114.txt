1: In this task, an Extruding and Drawing Machine Setter, Operator, or Tender for Metal and Plastic needs to adjust controls to draw or press metal into specified shapes and diameters. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. This task involves operating machinery and making precise adjustments to shape metal, which requires physical interaction and technical expertise. While the LLM can provide information on operating procedures or troubleshooting tips, it cannot physically adjust controls on a machine. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not involve text-based activities that the LLM can significantly assist with.

2: E0
