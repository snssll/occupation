1: In this task, a Funeral Home Manager is required to respond to customer complaints, legal inquiries, payment negotiations, or other post-service matters. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. Responding to customer complaints and legal inquiries involves written communication, which can be effectively handled by an LLM. The LLM can assist in drafting responses, providing legal information, negotiating payment terms, and addressing post-service matters. The task does not involve precise measurements, visuals, or physical interactions, making it suitable for LLM assistance.

Given that the LLM can generate written responses, provide legal information, and assist in negotiations, this task falls under E1 - Direct exposure. The LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to draft responses and handle post-service matters with equivalent quality.
