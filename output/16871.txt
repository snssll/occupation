1: In this task, the worker is required to tend spinning frames that draw out and twist roving or sliver into yarn. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. Since this task involves operating machinery and physically tending to spinning frames, it does not involve text input or output that can be directly processed by the LLM. The task also does not involve information retrieval, analysis, or decision-making that could benefit significantly from the capabilities of the LLM. Therefore, this task does not align with any of the exposure levels in the rubric.

2: E0

3: High
