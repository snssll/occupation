1: In this task, a Drywall and Ceiling Tile Installer is required to remove existing plaster, drywall, or paneling using crowbars and hammers. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality. 

Given the physical nature of the task, which involves using tools like crowbars and hammers to physically remove materials, it is clear that the task cannot be directly completed using the LLM. The LLM does not have the capability to physically interact with the environment or perform manual labor tasks. Additionally, this task does not involve complex decision-making, data analysis, writing, or any other activity that the LLM could assist with. Therefore, the task does not fall under E1, E2, or E3 exposure categories.
