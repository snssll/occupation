1: In this task, the worker is required to compute data related to gear dimensions or machine settings using their knowledge of shop mathematics. To complete this task, the worker needs to perform calculations based on specific formulas and measurements. An LLM could potentially assist by providing guidance on the mathematical calculations involved, explaining the formulas, or even generating sample calculations. However, since this task involves precise measurements and calculations that require a deep understanding of shop mathematics, the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete the task with high quality. While the LLM could provide some general information or explanations, the specific calculations and application of shop mathematics would likely still need to be done manually by the worker.
