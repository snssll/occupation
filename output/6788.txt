1: In this task, a genetic counselor is required to explain diagnostic procedures such as chorionic villus sampling (CVS), ultrasound, fetal blood sampling, and amniocentesis. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM can assist in completing it. 

- The task involves explaining complex medical procedures, which requires accurate and detailed information.
- The LLM can provide information on these procedures, their purposes, risks, and benefits based on existing knowledge within its training data.
- The LLM can generate text explaining these procedures in a clear and understandable manner.
- The LLM can also provide up-to-date information on these procedures if it is available in the input data.

Based on these considerations, the task can be significantly aided by the LLM in providing detailed explanations of the diagnostic procedures, potentially reducing the time it takes to gather and present this information accurately.
