1: In this task, an Arbitrator, Mediator, or Conciliator is required to issue subpoenas or administer oaths to prepare for formal hearings. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves legal procedures and interactions that may require human judgment, understanding of legal nuances, and interpersonal skills.
- The task does not involve writing or transforming text, summarizing documents, providing feedback on documents, or generating questions.
- While the LLM could potentially assist in drafting legal documents or providing information on legal procedures, the task of issuing subpoenas or administering oaths is more complex and involves legal expertise beyond what the LLM can provide.
- The task does not involve image capabilities, as it is primarily focused on legal procedures and interactions.

Based on these considerations, the task of issuing subpoenas or administering oaths for formal hearings is best classified as E0 - No exposure to LLM.
