1: In this task, an Orthotist or Prosthetist is responsible for fitting, testing, and evaluating devices on patients, making adjustments for proper fit, function, and comfort. This task involves hands-on work with patients, requiring physical interaction and precise measurements. The task does not involve writing, summarizing documents, or providing feedback on written materials. The expertise needed for this task lies in the ability to assess physical comfort and functionality, which cannot be effectively replicated by an LLM. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM or any tools built on top of it.
