1: In this task, a Social Work Teacher, Postsecondary is required to select and obtain materials and supplies, such as textbooks or laboratory equipment. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone or with additional software could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task.

- E0: This task involves physical actions such as selecting and obtaining materials and supplies, which cannot be directly assisted by the LLM or any software built on top of it. The task also does not involve complex decision-making that could be automated by the LLM.

- E1: While the LLM could potentially assist in researching and providing information about specific textbooks or laboratory equipment, the task itself primarily involves physical actions that cannot be directly performed by the LLM. The LLM may help in generating lists of recommended materials based on input criteria, but the actual selection and obtaining process would still require human intervention.

- E2: It is conceivable that additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to streamline the process of researching and recommending materials and supplies for social work teaching. This software could potentially analyze curriculum requirements, student needs, and budget constraints to suggest the most suitable materials. However, the physical act of selecting and obtaining the materials would still need to be done manually.

- E3: The task does not involve image capabilities that would significantly impact the time it takes to complete. Therefore, exposure to image capabilities would not have a substantial effect on this task.
