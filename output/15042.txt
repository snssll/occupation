1: In this task, a graphic designer is required to review final layouts and suggest improvements as needed. With the help of the LLM, a graphic designer could potentially receive assistance in generating ideas for layout improvements, providing suggestions for design elements, or even explaining design principles for better layouts. The LLM could also help in providing examples of successful layouts or trends in graphic design that could be incorporated into the final design. Overall, the LLM could significantly reduce the time it takes for a graphic designer to brainstorm and come up with suggestions for layout improvements.

Considering the task involves text input (final layouts) and text output (suggestions for improvements), the LLM can easily assist in this process by providing relevant information and ideas related to graphic design. The task does not require precise measurements or detailed visuals, making it suitable for LLM assistance. Therefore, this task falls under E1 as the LLM can reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality by at least half.
