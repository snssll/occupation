1: In this task, the Appraisers and Assessors of Real Estate need to review applications for property tax exemptions or deductions. To complete this task, they would typically need to assess the property value, consider any relevant regulations or guidelines, and make a decision based on the information provided in the application. With access to the powerful OpenAI large language model (LLM), the appraisers could potentially input the details of the application, relevant property information, and any specific regulations into the model to get insights or recommendations on whether to approve or deny the application. The LLM could assist in analyzing the information provided, highlighting key points, and potentially even suggesting factors to consider in the decision-making process. This would significantly streamline the review process and provide additional insights to the appraisers.

Considering the nature of the task and the capabilities of the LLM, it falls under the category of E1 - Direct exposure. The LLM can help in processing the application details, providing analysis, and aiding in decision-making, thereby reducing the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality.
