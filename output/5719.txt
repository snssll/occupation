1: In this task, the Earth Drillers are responsible for disinfecting, reconstructing, and redeveloping contaminated wells and water pumping systems, as well as cleaning and disinfecting new wells. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider whether access to the LLM or LLM-powered tools can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced Earth Driller to complete these tasks with high quality.

Given the nature of the task, which involves physical work such as disinfecting, reconstructing, and cleaning wells, it is unlikely that the LLM or LLM-powered tools can directly assist in these activities. The task requires hands-on work, precise measurements, and physical labor, which cannot be replaced by text-based AI models. Therefore, the task falls under E0 as it does not clearly decrease the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete the task with high quality by at least half.

2: E0
