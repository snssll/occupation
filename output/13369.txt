1: In this task, a Parking Enforcement Worker is required to provide information to the public regarding parking regulations, facilities, and the location of streets, buildings, and points of interest. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves providing information based on existing knowledge and regulations, which can be easily accessed and processed by the LLM.
- The LLM can assist in generating accurate and detailed responses to inquiries about parking regulations, facilities, and locations.
- The task does not involve complex decision-making or specialized domain knowledge beyond what the LLM can provide.

Based on these considerations, the task can be significantly expedited and completed with equivalent quality by using the LLM to generate responses and information for the public.
