1: In this task, a First-Line Supervisor of Correctional Officers is required to complete administrative paperwork or supervise the preparation or maintenance of records, forms, or reports. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could assist in completing it. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The task involves writing and maintaining records, which can be facilitated by the LLM through text generation and organization. The LLM can assist in drafting reports, filling out forms, and organizing data, potentially reducing the time needed for these administrative tasks.
- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM can help with text generation and organization, there may be additional software that could be developed to specifically cater to the needs of correctional facilities, such as automated record-keeping systems or report generation tools tailored to this specific domain.
- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Since the task primarily involves administrative paperwork and record-keeping, image capabilities are not directly relevant in this context.

Based on the analysis, the task of completing administrative paperwork or supervising the preparation or maintenance of records for First-Line Supervisors of Correctional Officers falls under E1: Direct exposure.
