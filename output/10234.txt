1: In this task, a Mental Health and Substance Abuse Social Worker is required to monitor, evaluate, and record client progress with respect to treatment goals. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves primarily writing and transforming text (client progress reports) according to specific instructions.
- The task does not require accessing up-to-date facts from the internet unless they are relevant to the client's treatment progress, which can be captured in the input.
- The task does not involve creating or editing digital images, reading text from PDFs, or any other image-related capabilities.
- While the task may benefit from additional software that could help organize and analyze client data more efficiently, the core task of monitoring, evaluating, and recording client progress is primarily text-based.

Based on these considerations, the task of monitoring, evaluating, and recording client progress for Mental Health and Substance Abuse Social Workers can be best classified as E1 - Direct exposure.
