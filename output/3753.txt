1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of coordinating recipe development and standardization and developing new menus for independent food service operations as a Dietitian or Nutritionist, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be aided by the use of a large language model (LLM) like OpenAI's model.

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** If the task involves a significant amount of writing, such as creating standardized recipes, menu descriptions, or nutritional information, the LLM could be used to assist in generating this text efficiently. The model can help in transforming text, providing edits, and summarizing documents related to recipes and menus. Additionally, the LLM can assist in providing feedback on documents, answering questions about recipes and menus, and even generating questions or training materials based on nutrition knowledge.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the LLM alone may not reduce the time it takes to complete the task by half, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to enhance the process. For example, specialized applications could be created to summarize extensive nutritional research documents, retrieve up-to-date information on food trends, or provide recommendations based on data analysis related to nutrition and menu planning.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Since the task does not involve detailed visual elements or require image processing capabilities, the use of image capabilities provided by the LLM would not significantly impact the completion of the task.
