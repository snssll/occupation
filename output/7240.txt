1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of guiding aircraft to designated areas using hand signals, batons, or other methods as an Aircraft Service Attendant, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves physical actions and interactions with aircraft, which cannot be directly replaced by text-based instructions or responses from the LLM. The LLM does not have the ability to physically guide aircraft or use hand signals. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it cannot be significantly aided by the LLM or any tools built on top of it.
