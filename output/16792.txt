1: In this task, the Credit Counselor is required to teach courses or seminars on topics related to budgeting, personal finance management, or financial literacy. To complete this task, the Credit Counselor needs to have a strong understanding of these topics and be able to effectively communicate and educate others. 

Considering the task at hand, the exposure to LLM can be evaluated as follows:
- E1: Direct access to the LLM could potentially assist in preparing course materials, creating presentations, or drafting educational content related to budgeting, personal finance management, or financial literacy. The LLM could help in generating explanations, examples, or answering specific questions related to these topics.
- E2: While having access to the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time it takes to teach courses or seminars, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to summarize complex financial concepts, provide real-time data analysis, or generate interactive learning materials.
- E3: Image capabilities are not relevant for this task as it primarily involves teaching and educating on financial topics through courses or seminars.
