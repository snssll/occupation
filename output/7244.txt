1: For the task of guiding and counseling students with adjustment or academic problems, or special academic interests as a Middle School Teacher, the exposure to LLM can be evaluated as follows:

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** The LLM can assist in providing guidance and counseling scripts, drafting responses to common student issues, and generating resources for academic support. It can also help in formulating strategies to address specific student needs based on general knowledge and best practices in education. The model can offer suggestions on how to approach different student scenarios effectively, enhancing the teacher's ability to support students.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task, additional software could be developed to create personalized counseling plans based on student data, track student progress, and provide tailored academic support recommendations. This software could leverage the LLM's capabilities to analyze student information and offer insights for more effective guidance and counseling strategies.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Image capabilities would not have a significant impact on guiding and counseling students with adjustment or academic problems. This task primarily involves text-based interactions and does not require image processing or creation.
