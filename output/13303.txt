1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of providing expert testimony in employment lawsuits as an Industrial-Organizational Psychologist, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it. 

- E0: This task involves a high degree of human interaction and legal expertise, which cannot be effectively replaced by the LLM. The LLM cannot make legal decisions or provide the nuanced understanding required for expert testimony in court cases.

- E1: While the LLM could potentially assist in drafting written reports or summaries related to the case, the core task of providing expert testimony involves complex legal and psychological analysis that goes beyond the capabilities of the LLM. The LLM may be able to help with background research or drafting certain sections of a report, but it cannot replace the expertise and experience required to testify in court.

- E2: It is conceivable that specialized software could be developed on top of the LLM to assist Industrial-Organizational Psychologists in organizing case information, summarizing key points, or even generating initial drafts of reports. However, the task of providing expert testimony still heavily relies on human judgment, interpretation, and communication skills that are not easily replicated by AI.

- E3: The task of providing expert testimony in employment lawsuits does not involve image processing or visual data that would benefit from additional image capabilities. Therefore, this task does not fall under E3 exposure.

Based on the analysis above, the most appropriate label for the task of providing expert testimony in employment lawsuits as an Industrial-Organizational Psychologist is E2.
