1: In this task, the main activity involves marking items with specific details like grade or acceptance-rejection status. This task primarily involves manual work and does not require complex decision-making or specialized knowledge beyond what is typically known in the field. The task does not involve text input or output that would benefit significantly from the capabilities of an LLM. While an LLM could potentially assist in generating labels or instructions for marking items, the nature of the task itself does not lend to substantial time savings or quality improvement by using an LLM. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not clearly benefit from LLM exposure.
