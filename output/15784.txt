1: In this task, an Explosives Worker, Ordnance Handling Expert, or Blaster is required to set up and operate equipment like hoists, jackhammers, and drills to bore charge holes. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality. Given that this task involves physical equipment operation and potentially hazardous activities, it is unlikely that the LLM or any tool built on top of it can assist in completing this task. The task requires hands-on skills, precision, and safety protocols that cannot be replaced by text-based AI models.
