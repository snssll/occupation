1: In this task, the occupation involves tending auxiliary equipment used in welding processes. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if the task can be completed more efficiently with the help of an LLM. 

- Tending auxiliary equipment in welding processes may involve monitoring and adjusting settings, ensuring proper functioning, and troubleshooting issues with the equipment.
- While an LLM could potentially provide information on welding processes, techniques, or troubleshooting tips, the task itself is hands-on and requires physical interaction with the equipment.
- The task does not involve extensive written or spoken communication that could be significantly enhanced by an LLM.
- An LLM does not have the capability to physically tend to equipment or perform welding tasks.
