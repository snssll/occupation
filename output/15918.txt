1: In this task, a Stone Cutter and Carver in manufacturing is required to shape, trim, or touch up roughed-out designs with appropriate tools to finish carvings. To determine the exposure label for this task in relation to the LLM, we need to consider the nature of the task. Stone cutting and carving are physical, hands-on activities that require precision and skill. The task involves working with physical materials like stone and using specialized tools to shape and finish carvings. This task does not involve text input or output, and the expertise required is primarily manual and technical in nature. The LLM, even with additional software, cannot replace the physical aspect of this task, as it involves intricate work with materials that cannot be replicated through text or code alone. Therefore, the task does not fall under E1, E2, or E3 exposure categories as the LLM cannot significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with high quality.

2: E0

3: High
