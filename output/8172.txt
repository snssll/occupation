1: In this task, the occupation involves installing preformed metal scaffolding in cupolas using hand tools. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone or with additional software could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality.

Given that this task involves physical work with hand tools and requires on-site installation of scaffolding, it does not seem feasible for the LLM or any software built on top of it to assist in completing this task. The task is highly manual and requires physical presence and expertise in handling tools and materials, which cannot be replaced by text-based AI models.
