1: In this task of modifying computer-controlled robot movements, a Robotics Technician would typically need to adjust the programming of the robot to change its movements. With the help of a powerful OpenAI large language model (LLM), the technician could potentially receive assistance in writing and transforming code to modify the robot's movements. The LLM could provide suggestions, code snippets, or explanations on how to adjust the robot's movements effectively. This would significantly reduce the time it takes for the technician to complete the task, as they could leverage the LLM's capabilities to streamline the coding process.

Considering the nature of the task and the potential for the LLM to assist in writing and transforming code for robot movements, it aligns more closely with E1 exposure. The LLM can directly contribute to enhancing the technician's ability to modify computer-controlled robot movements by providing coding support and guidance.
