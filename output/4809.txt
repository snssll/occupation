1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of developing applied software for the analysis and interpretation of geological data as a Geoscientist, I will consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves writing code to create software that can analyze and interpret geological data, which falls under writing code to perform a task that used to be done by hand. The LLM can assist in generating code snippets, providing insights on best practices, and suggesting algorithms for data analysis. While the LLM alone may not reduce the time it takes to complete the entire software development process significantly, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to automate parts of the coding process, provide real-time feedback on code quality, or offer suggestions for optimizing the software. Therefore, this task falls under E2 - Exposure by LLM-powered applications.

2: E2

3: Moderate
