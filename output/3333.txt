1: In this task, a Title Examiner, Abstractor, or Searcher is required to confer with various parties to exchange title-related information or resolve problems. With access to the powerful OpenAI large language model (LLM), the worker could potentially use the model to draft emails, responses, or summaries of title-related information. The LLM could assist in generating questions to ask during these conversations or provide suggestions on how to resolve title-related issues. Additionally, the LLM could help in maintaining records of the information exchanged during these discussions. Overall, the LLM could significantly reduce the time it takes to prepare for and engage in these conversations, improving efficiency and accuracy.
