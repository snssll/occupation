1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of fabricating ducts for HVAC systems as a Sheet Metal Worker, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be impacted by the use of the LLM.

- The task involves fabricating ducts for HVAC systems, which requires specialized knowledge and skills in sheet metal work.
- The task does not involve text input or output, and the context is more hands-on and practical rather than text-based.
- The task requires physical manipulation of materials and precise measurements, which are not within the capabilities of the LLM.
- While the LLM could potentially provide information on best practices for HVAC systems or general guidance on duct fabrication, it cannot directly assist in the physical fabrication process.

Based on these considerations, it is clear that the task of fabricating ducts for HVAC systems as a Sheet Metal Worker falls under E0 as it involves hands-on work that cannot be significantly aided by the LLM.
