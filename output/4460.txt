1: In this task, a makeup artist specializing in theatrical and performance makeup is required to design rubber or plastic prostheses to alter performers' appearances. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves a high level of creativity and specialized knowledge in prosthetic design, which may not be directly aided by the LLM.
- While the LLM can provide information on prosthetic design principles and techniques, it may not have the practical expertise or hands-on experience required to design prostheses.
- The task also involves physical materials and potentially requires hands-on work, which is beyond the capabilities of the LLM.
- Given the specialized nature of prosthetic design and the hands-on aspect of creating physical prostheses, it is unlikely that the LLM alone or tools built on top of it could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task.

Based on these considerations, the task of designing rubber or plastic prostheses for performers falls under E0 as it involves a high degree of human creativity, specialized knowledge, and physical craftsmanship that cannot be effectively replaced or significantly expedited by the LLM.
