1: In this task, a security guard is required to call the police or fire departments in cases of emergency, such as fire or the presence of unauthorized persons. With the help of the LLM, the security guard could potentially draft a detailed script or guideline on how to handle different emergency situations, including when to call the authorities, what information to provide, and how to communicate effectively. The LLM could also assist in creating training materials for security guards on emergency protocols. However, the task itself does not involve complex text transformation, translation, summarization, or data analysis that would significantly benefit from direct access to the LLM. Therefore, this task does not fall under E1. Additionally, while it is conceivable that software could be developed on top of the LLM to provide recommendations or analyze data related to emergency situations, the core task of calling the police or fire departments does not inherently require such capabilities. Hence, it does not fit under E2. The task also does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images, so it does not align with E3. Therefore, the most appropriate label for this task is E0.

2: E0

3: High
