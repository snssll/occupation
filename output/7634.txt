1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of increasing social work knowledge by reviewing current literature, conducting social research, or attending seminars, training workshops, or classes as a Mental Health and Substance Abuse Social Worker, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The LLM can assist in summarizing medium-length documents, providing feedback on documents, and answering questions about documents. It can also help in preparing training materials based on general knowledge. However, the task of reviewing current literature, conducting social research, or attending seminars involves a level of interaction and engagement that goes beyond what the LLM can provide. While the LLM can assist in summarizing and analyzing specific documents, it cannot fully replace the need for active participation in seminars, workshops, or classes to gain practical experience and insights in the field of mental health and substance abuse social work.
