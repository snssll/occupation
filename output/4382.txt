1: In this task, a Transportation Planner is responsible for designing new or improved transport infrastructure. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the complexity of the task and the potential for the LLM to assist in completing it. 

- The task involves designing transport infrastructure, which requires specialized knowledge in urban planning, engineering, and transportation systems.
- The task may involve analyzing traffic flow, safety considerations, environmental impact, and community needs.
- The task may require collaboration with various stakeholders, such as government agencies, engineers, and community members.
- The task involves creating detailed plans and proposals for infrastructure projects.

Given the complexity and specialized knowledge required for this task, as well as the need for collaboration and detailed planning, it is unlikely that the LLM alone or tools built on top of it could significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced Transportation Planner to complete this task with high quality. The task involves real-world considerations and expertise that go beyond the capabilities of the LLM.
