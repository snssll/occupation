1: In this task, a dental hygienist is required to clean calcareous deposits, accretions, and stains from teeth and beneath the margins of gums using dental instruments. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves manual dexterity, precision, and knowledge of dental hygiene practices. While the task description does not explicitly mention the need for extensive research or access to up-to-date information, the general knowledge and skills required for this task are typically acquired through education and training in dental hygiene.

Given that the task does not involve complex text processing, data analysis, or specialized domain knowledge retrieval beyond what is typically learned in dental hygiene education, it is unlikely that access to an LLM would significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task. The task is primarily hands-on and practical, requiring physical interaction with patients and dental instruments. Therefore, the task is best classified as E0 - No exposure to LLM.

2: E0
