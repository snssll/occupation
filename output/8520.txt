1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of investigating claims of inability to pay taxes by researching court information, liens, mortgages, financial statements, or locating assets through third parties, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves researching court information, financial documents, and locating assets, which are primarily text-based activities. The LLM can assist in conducting research, summarizing information, and providing insights based on the data available within its 2000-word context limit. While the LLM cannot access real-time data unless provided in the input, it can still significantly reduce the time required for information gathering and analysis in this task.
