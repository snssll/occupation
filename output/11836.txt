1: In this task, a Semiconductor Processing Technician is required to place semiconductor wafers in processing containers or equipment holders using tools like a vacuum wand or tweezers. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if access to the LLM or LLM-powered tools can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality.

- E0: This task involves physical manipulation of semiconductor wafers using tools like vacuum wands or tweezers. The task requires manual dexterity and precision, which cannot be replicated by the LLM or any LLM-powered tools. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not involve text input or output that can be effectively handled by the LLM.

2: E0

3: High
