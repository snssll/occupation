1: In this task, a dermatologist evaluates patients to determine their eligibility for cosmetic procedures. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes for a dermatologist to evaluate patients for cosmetic procedures. The LLM could potentially assist by providing information on the latest trends, techniques, and research in cosmetic procedures, helping the dermatologist make more informed decisions. It could also help in generating standardized evaluation forms or checklists based on best practices. However, the actual evaluation of patients would still require physical examination, interaction, and expertise that cannot be replaced by the LLM. Therefore, while the LLM can provide some support in terms of information and guidelines, it cannot fully replace the expertise and physical examination required in this task.
