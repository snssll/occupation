1: In this task, a makeup artist working in theatrical and performance settings is required to duplicate work precisely to replicate characters' appearances on a daily basis. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves a high level of manual dexterity and artistic skill, which cannot be directly replaced by an LLM.
- The task does not involve written or spoken communication that could be significantly aided by an LLM.
- While an LLM could potentially provide some guidance or inspiration for makeup looks, the actual execution of the makeup work requires physical application and artistic interpretation.
- There are no specific documents or data inputs that the LLM could process to directly assist in replicating characters' appearances.

Based on these considerations, it is evident that the task of duplicating work precisely to replicate characters' appearances in theatrical and performance settings does not lend itself to automation or significant assistance from an LLM. Therefore, the appropriate exposure label for this task is E0.

2: E0

3: High
