1: In this task, a Team Assembler is required to provide assistance in the production of wiring assemblies. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. Providing assistance in the production of wiring assemblies involves physical work and hands-on tasks that cannot be directly performed by an LLM. The task requires manual dexterity, understanding of wiring diagrams, and the ability to work with physical components. Since the task involves physical actions and does not primarily rely on text-based inputs or outputs, it falls under the category of tasks that cannot be significantly aided by an LLM. Therefore, this task would be classified as E0 as it does not benefit from the capabilities of an LLM.

2: E0
