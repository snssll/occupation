1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of devising and evaluating methods and procedures for collecting data as a Market Research Analyst or Marketing Specialist, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be aided by the use of a large language model (LLM).

- Market Research Analysts and Marketing Specialists often need to create surveys, opinion polls, questionnaires, and other data collection methods to gather information for their research projects.
- The LLM can assist in generating survey questions, designing questionnaires, and even providing insights into the best practices for data collection methodologies based on existing knowledge.
- The LLM can also help in analyzing the data collected, but the task specified focuses on devising and evaluating methods for data collection, which is more about the initial planning stages rather than the analysis phase.
- While the LLM can provide guidance and suggestions based on existing information, it may not significantly reduce the time it takes to devise and evaluate data collection methods, as this task requires a deep understanding of research methodologies and specific industry knowledge.

Based on these considerations, the task of devising and evaluating methods and procedures for collecting data as a Market Research Analyst or Marketing Specialist would likely fall under label E2 - Exposure by LLM-powered applications.
