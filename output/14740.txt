1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of "Research and analyze reference materials, and consult with interested parties to develop new products or modify existing designs" for Jewelers and Precious Stone and Metal Workers, we need to consider the level of exposure to LLM.

- This task involves researching and analyzing reference materials, which can benefit from the LLM's ability to provide information and insights based on text input.
- Consulting with interested parties may involve generating questions, responding to inquiries, or providing feedback, all of which can be facilitated by the LLM's text generation capabilities.
- Developing new products or modifying existing designs may require creative input, which the LLM can assist with by providing suggestions or ideas based on the input provided.

Considering these factors, the task can be significantly enhanced by using the LLM to assist in research, analysis, communication, and idea generation, thereby reducing the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality. Therefore, this task falls under label E1.
