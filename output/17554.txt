1: In this task, the occupation involves shuttle drivers and chauffeurs who are responsible for maintaining the cleanliness of the vehicles they operate. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone or with additional software could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality.

- E0: This task involves physical actions such as vacuuming, cleaning, washing, and polishing vehicles. These actions cannot be performed by the LLM or any software tools associated with it. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not involve text-based work that can be automated by the LLM.

- E1: The task does not involve writing, transforming text, providing edits, summarizing documents, or any other text-based activities that the LLM can directly assist with. Therefore, it does not qualify for an E1 label.

- E2: While it is conceivable that software could be developed to automate scheduling vehicle cleanings or maintenance based on data inputs, the core task of physically cleaning the vehicles cannot be significantly expedited by the LLM alone. Thus, it does not fit the E2 category.

- E3: The task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images. Therefore, it does not align with the E3 label.

2: E0

3: High
