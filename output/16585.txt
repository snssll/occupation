1: In this task, a gambling dealer is required to supervise staff and monitor gambling tables to ensure the security of the game. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves overseeing staff and monitoring activities at gambling tables, which primarily involves human interaction and observation. While the LLM could potentially assist in providing guidelines or best practices for security measures, the core of the task involves real-time monitoring and decision-making based on human behavior and interactions. The LLM cannot physically supervise staff or monitor tables in real-time, as it lacks the ability to physically interact with the environment. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not significantly benefit from LLM capabilities.
