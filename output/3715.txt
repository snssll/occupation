1: In this task, a Fraud Examiner, Investigator, or Analyst is required to coordinate investigative efforts with law enforcement officers and attorneys. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could assist in completing it. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM could potentially assist in drafting communication, coordinating efforts, or providing guidance on investigative procedures. It could help in summarizing information, drafting reports, or suggesting strategies for collaboration. However, the task involves coordination with law enforcement officers and attorneys, which may require nuanced communication, legal knowledge, and real-time decision-making that the LLM alone may not be able to handle effectively.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM could provide general information on investigative procedures, legal terms, or best practices, it may not have access to real-time legal updates, case-specific details, or confidential information required for effective coordination with law enforcement and attorneys. Additional software could potentially be developed to integrate real-time legal databases, case management systems, or communication tools to enhance the coordination process.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - This task does not involve image processing or visual content, so image capabilities would not significantly impact the completion of the task.

Based on the analysis, the task of coordinating investigative efforts with law enforcement officers and attorneys falls under E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications.
