1: In this task, a Print Binding and Finishing Worker is required to cut cover material to specified dimensions, fit, and glue the material to binder boards either by hand or machine. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves manual work such as cutting, fitting, and gluing materials, which cannot be directly performed by an LLM.
- While the LLM could potentially provide guidance on dimensions, techniques, or troubleshooting, the actual physical work of cutting, fitting, and gluing cannot be done by the LLM itself.
- The task does not involve complex decision-making, specialized domain knowledge, or detailed data analysis that would significantly benefit from LLM capabilities.

Based on these considerations, the task of cutting cover material and gluing it to binder boards is a manual, hands-on task that does not directly benefit from LLM capabilities. Therefore, it falls under the E0 label.
