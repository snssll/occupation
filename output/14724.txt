1: In this task, a First-Line Supervisor of Material-Moving Machine and Vehicle Operators is required to requisition needed personnel, supplies, equipment, parts, or repair services. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves written communication and decision-making based on specific requirements.
- The task does not involve highly specialized domain knowledge or complex databases.
- The task does not require up-to-date facts from the internet.
- The task does not involve creating or editing digital images.
- The task does not involve reading text from PDFs.
- The task does not require detailed image analysis.
- The task does not involve interactions that require human judgment beyond what an LLM can provide.

Based on these considerations, the task does not significantly benefit from the capabilities of an LLM beyond what a human supervisor can accomplish. Therefore, the task falls under E0 as it does not clearly decrease the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete the task with high quality by at least half.
