1: In this task of cleaning windshields as an Automotive and Watercraft Service Attendant, the task is straightforward and does not involve complex decision-making or specialized knowledge beyond knowing how to properly clean windshields. The task does not require any in-depth analysis, research, or writing. Therefore, the task does not benefit significantly from the capabilities of a large language model (LLM). The LLM cannot physically clean windshields, and the task does not involve any text-based input or output that would require the use of the LLM. As such, the task falls under E0 as it does not meet the criteria for exposure to LLM capabilities.
