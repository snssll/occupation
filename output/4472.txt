1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of designing environmentally friendly spaces using sustainable materials as an Interior Designer, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be aided by the capabilities of the LLM.

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** The task involves a significant amount of research and decision-making based on knowledge of sustainable materials and environmental design principles. The LLM can assist in providing information on the latest trends in sustainable design, materials, and techniques. It can also help in generating ideas for environmentally friendly spaces based on input criteria. The LLM can aid in writing reports, summaries, or recommendations related to sustainable design practices.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the LLM can provide information and generate ideas related to sustainable design, it may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task by half. However, with additional software developed on top of the LLM, such as a tool that can search and retrieve up-to-date information on sustainable materials and design practices, the task could be expedited.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Image capabilities are not directly relevant to the task of designing environmentally friendly spaces using sustainable materials. The task primarily involves research, decision-making, and creativity related to sustainable design principles, which can be effectively supported by text-based information and assistance from the LLM.
