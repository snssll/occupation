1: In this task, the Special Education teacher or teaching assistant is required to teach socially acceptable behavior using techniques like behavior modification or positive reinforcement. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be significantly aided by the use of the language model. The LLM could potentially assist in providing strategies, examples, or theoretical frameworks related to behavior modification and positive reinforcement. It could also help in generating lesson plans, scripts for role-playing scenarios, or creating visual aids to support the teaching process. However, since the task involves practical implementation and interaction with students, which cannot be directly facilitated by the LLM, the model's assistance may not lead to a significant reduction in the time it takes to complete the task.
