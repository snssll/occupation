1: In this task, a transportation planner is required to develop computer models to address transportation planning issues. With the help of the most powerful OpenAI large language model (LLM), the planner can potentially receive assistance in writing and transforming text related to the computer models. The LLM can help in providing insights, generating ideas, and even suggesting potential variables or parameters to consider in the models. The model can also assist in summarizing existing transportation planning documents, which can be used as references for developing the computer models. Additionally, the LLM can help in formulating complex instructions or specifications for the computer models. Overall, the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task by providing valuable input and suggestions related to transportation planning issues and computer modeling.
