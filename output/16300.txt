1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of "Store, retrieve, and manipulate data for analysis of system capabilities and requirements" for the occupations of Software Developers, Software Quality Assurance Analysts and Testers, and Computer Hardware Engineers, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be impacted by the capabilities of the LLM.

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** If the task involves writing and transforming text or code according to complex instructions, providing edits to existing text or code, or writing code to automate data storage, retrieval, and manipulation processes, then direct access to the LLM could significantly reduce the time needed to complete the task with equivalent quality.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** If additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to summarize large volumes of data, retrieve up-to-date information for analysis, or provide recommendations based on data inputs, then the task may benefit from exposure to LLM-powered applications.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Since the task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images, the image capabilities of the LLM would not significantly impact the completion time of the task.

Considering the task involves data storage, retrieval, and manipulation for analysis, it is likely that direct access to the LLM could assist in writing code, transforming text, or providing edits to support these processes, leading to a reduction in time required for completion.
