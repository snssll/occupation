1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of editing broadcast material electronically using computers as a Broadcast Technician, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. In this task, the Broadcast Technician is required to use computers to edit broadcast material, which involves tasks such as cutting, splicing, and enhancing audio and video content. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM could potentially assist in providing guidance on editing techniques, suggesting creative ideas for editing, or even generating scripts for broadcast material. The LLM could help in transforming text instructions into actionable editing steps, which could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality.
- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not be able to directly edit broadcast material, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to automate certain editing processes, provide real-time feedback on editing choices, or even suggest improvements based on current trends in broadcasting.
- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Since the task involves editing broadcast material, which includes working with audio and video content, having image capabilities could be beneficial. The LLM, along with image capabilities, could potentially assist in identifying specific scenes, objects, or transitions within the broadcast material, making the editing process more efficient.

Based on the above analysis, the task of editing broadcast material electronically using computers as a Broadcast Technician could be best classified as E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications.
