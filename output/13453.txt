1: In this task, a Home Appliance Repairer is required to provide repair cost estimates and recommend whether appliance repair or replacement is a better choice. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves analyzing the condition of the appliance, estimating repair costs, and making a recommendation based on expertise. While the LLM can provide general information about appliance repair and replacement, it lacks the ability to physically inspect the appliance, assess its condition, or provide accurate cost estimates without detailed information. The task also requires specialized knowledge and hands-on experience, which the LLM may not possess. Therefore, the task falls under E0 as it involves a high degree of human interaction, precise assessment, and specialized expertise that cannot be fully replaced by the LLM.
