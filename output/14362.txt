1: In this task, the Morticians, Undertakers, and Funeral Arrangers are responsible for removing deceased remains from the place of death. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality. Given that this task involves physical work and handling deceased remains, it is unlikely that the LLM or any LLM-powered tool can assist in this process. The task requires physical presence, specialized training, and adherence to legal and ethical guidelines, which cannot be replaced by text-based AI tools. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not meet the criteria for exposure to LLM capabilities.
