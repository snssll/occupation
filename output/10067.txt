1: In this task, a midwife is required to monitor the maternal condition during labor by checking vital signs, monitoring uterine contractions, and performing physical examinations. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes for a midwife to complete this task with equivalent quality. 

- Direct exposure (E1): The LLM could potentially assist by providing information on best practices for monitoring maternal conditions during labor, explaining the significance of different vital signs, contractions, and examination results. It could also help in generating standardized forms for recording this information. However, the actual monitoring of vital signs, contractions, and physical examinations require hands-on skills and cannot be directly performed by the LLM.

- Exposure by LLM-powered applications (E2): While the LLM alone may not be able to directly reduce the time it takes to complete the task, additional software could be developed to provide real-time guidance based on the data input by the midwife. This software could analyze the data, provide insights, and suggest next steps based on established protocols and guidelines.

- Exposure given image capabilities (E3): Image capabilities would not significantly impact the monitoring of maternal conditions during labor, as this task primarily involves physical assessments and data interpretation rather than image processing.

Considering the above analysis, the task of monitoring maternal condition during labor by a midwife is best classified as E2 - Exposure by LLM-powered applications.
