1: In this task, a Food Preparation Worker is required to remove trash and clean kitchen garbage containers. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality by at least half.

- Direct exposure (E1): The task of removing trash and cleaning garbage containers does not involve complex text transformations, writing, summarizing, or any other text-based activities that the LLM excels at. The task is physical in nature and requires manual labor, which the LLM cannot perform.

- Exposure by LLM-powered applications (E2): While it is conceivable that software could be developed to assist with organizing schedules, inventory management, or other administrative tasks related to food preparation, the specific task of physically removing trash and cleaning garbage containers does not align with the capabilities of the LLM or potential software built on top of it.

- Exposure given image capabilities (E3): The task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images. Therefore, image capabilities would not significantly impact the completion of this task.

Based on the analysis above, the task of removing trash and cleaning kitchen garbage containers does not align with any of the exposure labels provided.
