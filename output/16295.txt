1: In this task, a Food Preparation Worker is responsible for storing food in designated containers and storage areas to prevent spoilage. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes for a worker to complete this task with high quality. 

- Direct exposure (E1): The task of storing food in designated containers and storage areas is a practical, hands-on task that does not involve complex instructions, writing, summarizing, or translating text. While the LLM could potentially provide information on best practices for food storage, the task itself does not involve text input or output that the LLM could directly assist with. Therefore, direct access to the LLM would not reduce the time significantly for completing this task.

- Exposure by LLM-powered applications (E2): While it is conceivable that software could be developed on top of the LLM to provide recommendations on food storage techniques or guidelines, the task of physically storing food in containers and storage areas is not one that would benefit significantly from such software. The core of the task involves manual labor and practical knowledge rather than information processing or decision-making that the LLM could enhance.

- Exposure given image capabilities (E3): Image capabilities would not be relevant for this task as it does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images. The task is more about physical actions related to food storage rather than visual information processing.

Based on the above analysis, the task of storing food in designated containers and storage areas to prevent spoilage does not align with any of the exposure labels provided.
