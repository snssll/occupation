1: In this task, an Online Merchant is required to participate in online forums or conferences to stay updated on online retailing trends, techniques, or security threats. With the help of the LLM, the Online Merchant could potentially benefit from automated summarization of forum discussions, generating questions to ask during conferences, or even drafting responses to common queries. The LLM could also assist in researching and providing insights on emerging trends or security threats in the online retailing space. However, the task primarily involves human interaction and real-time engagement in online forums and conferences, which may not be significantly expedited by the LLM. While the LLM could aid in information retrieval and analysis, the core aspect of actively participating in these events would still require human involvement.
