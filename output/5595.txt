1: In this task, a Bioinformatics Scientist is required to direct the work of technicians and IT staff applying bioinformatics tools in various areas. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task involves writing and transforming text, providing edits, summarizing documents, answering questions, or maintaining records. Since the task involves directing the work of others and applying specialized tools in bioinformatics, it does not directly align with tasks that can be significantly enhanced by the LLM alone. However, it is easy to imagine additional software that could be developed on top of the LLM to assist in analyzing data, making recommendations, or providing counsel on bioinformatics-related issues. Therefore, this task falls under E2 as having access to the LLM alone may not reduce the time significantly, but additional software could be developed to enhance the task.
