1: In this task, an Information Security Engineer is responsible for developing or installing software to protect sensitive information. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- Developing software for security purposes may involve writing code, understanding encryption algorithms, and implementing security protocols. An LLM could potentially assist in generating code snippets, explaining encryption concepts, or providing best practices for security implementation.
- Installing software like firewalls and encryption programs may involve understanding system configurations, network setups, and troubleshooting potential issues. An LLM could help provide guidance on installation steps, common configurations, or troubleshooting tips.

Given that the task involves technical knowledge and implementation skills related to information security, an LLM could provide valuable insights, recommendations, and explanations to support an Information Security Engineer in their work. While the LLM may not directly perform the task, it can significantly reduce the time needed for research, decision-making, and problem-solving in this domain.
