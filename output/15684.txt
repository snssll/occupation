1: In this task, a psychiatrist is required to serve on committees to promote or maintain community mental health services or delivery systems. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves participating in committee work related to community mental health services, which primarily involves communication, collaboration, and decision-making. While the LLM can provide information and generate text, it cannot actively participate in committee work, which requires human interaction, decision-making, and nuanced understanding of community mental health services. Therefore, this task does not involve writing, summarizing, translating, or any other text-based activities that the LLM could significantly assist with. As a result, this task falls under E0 as it does not clearly decrease the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete the task with high quality by at least half.

2: E0

3: High
