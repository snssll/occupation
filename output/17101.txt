1: In this task of tracking the status of requisitions, contracts, and orders as a Procurement Clerk, the use of an LLM could potentially reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality. The LLM could assist in summarizing information related to requisitions, contracts, and orders, providing updates on their status, and generating reports based on the data. The LLM could also help in organizing and maintaining records of these transactions.
