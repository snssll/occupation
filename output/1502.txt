1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of baking breads, rolls, or other pastries as a Cook in an institution or cafeteria, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task itself does not involve complex text input or output, and it primarily requires hands-on skills in baking. The LLM does not have the ability to physically bake or interact with physical objects. While the LLM could potentially provide recipes or information on baking techniques, the task of actually baking the items cannot be directly completed by the LLM. Therefore, the task does not fall under E1, E2, or E3 categories as it does not significantly benefit from the LLM's capabilities.

2: E0

3: High
