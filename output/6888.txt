1: In this task for Medical Equipment Repairers, the main activity involves fabricating, dressing down, or substituting parts to modify equipment based on various sources of information like job orders, sketches, modification orders, samples, or discussions with operating officials. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be significantly expedited or improved by using the language model. 

- E0: This task involves hands-on work that requires physical manipulation of equipment and materials. LLMs are not capable of performing physical tasks or interacting with physical objects, so they cannot directly assist in fabricating or modifying equipment.
- E1: While the LLM can provide information on equipment repair techniques, it cannot physically fabricate or modify equipment. The task involves practical skills and hands-on work that cannot be directly replaced by text-based instructions or information from the LLM.
- E2: It is conceivable that software could be developed to assist Medical Equipment Repairers by providing detailed repair manuals, equipment schematics, or troubleshooting guides based on the information provided in the task. However, this software would need to go beyond text generation and incorporate interactive features or augmented reality to guide the repair process effectively.
- E3: The task does not involve image processing or detailed visual instructions that would benefit from image capabilities. The task primarily revolves around physical modifications to equipment based on textual information.
