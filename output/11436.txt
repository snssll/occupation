1: In this task, the Acute Care Nurses are required to perform emergency medical procedures such as basic cardiac life support (BLS), advanced cardiac life support (ACLS), and other condition-stabilizing interventions. This task involves critical and time-sensitive actions that require hands-on medical expertise, physical presence, and immediate decision-making based on the patient's condition. The task does not involve text-based information processing or data analysis that could be effectively handled by an LLM. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM or any tools built on top of it.
