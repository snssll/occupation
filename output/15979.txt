1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of signaling workers to move loaded cars as a Loading and Moving Machine Operator in Underground Mining, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be impacted by the use of the LLM.

- E1: Direct exposure - In this case, the task involves a straightforward instruction that can be communicated through text. The LLM can assist in generating clear and concise instructions for signaling workers to move loaded cars, potentially reducing the time it takes to convey the message effectively.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the task itself is relatively simple and can be aided by text-based instructions, there may be additional software developed on top of the LLM that could enhance the communication process further. For example, an application that can provide real-time translations of instructions into multiple languages for diverse work environments could be beneficial.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Since the task does not involve detailed visuals or image processing, the use of image capabilities provided by the LLM would not significantly impact the completion of the task.
