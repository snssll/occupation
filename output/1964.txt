1: In this task, the occupation involves cleaning and polishing footwear using various tools and products. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be automated or significantly assisted by the language model. Since this task is very hands-on and requires physical interaction with footwear and cleaning tools, it does not involve text-based instructions or information that can be easily processed by an LLM. The task does not involve complex decision-making, data analysis, or text transformation that would benefit from LLM capabilities. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM.
