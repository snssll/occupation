1: In this task, a secondary school teacher is required to provide students with disabilities with assistive devices, supportive technology, and assistance accessing facilities such as restrooms. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves understanding the specific needs of students with disabilities, selecting appropriate assistive devices and technology, and providing physical assistance when necessary. While an LLM can provide general information about disabilities and assistive technology, it lacks the ability to physically assist students or access facilities. Therefore, the task cannot be significantly expedited or completed with equivalent quality solely by using an LLM. As a result, this task falls under E0 as it does not meet the criteria for exposure to LLM capabilities.
