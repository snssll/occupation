1: In this task, the cashier is responsible for sorting, counting, and wrapping currency and coins. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes for a cashier to complete this task with high quality. 

- The task of sorting, counting, and wrapping currency and coins is a manual and physical task that does not involve complex text input or output.
- The task does not require writing, summarizing documents, providing feedback on documents, translating text, or any other text-based activities that the LLM excels at.
- The task does not involve accessing up-to-date facts, specialized domain knowledge, or making recommendations based on data.
- The task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images.

Given these considerations, it is clear that the task of sorting, counting, and wrapping currency and coins does not benefit from exposure to the LLM in any significant way. The LLM cannot perform physical tasks or handle currency, so it would not reduce the time it takes for a cashier to complete this task.
