1: In this task of applying chemicals to neutralize the effects of solvents as a Laundry and Dry-Cleaning Worker, the exposure to LLM can be evaluated as follows:

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** The task involves a specific and straightforward action that can be described in text form. The LLM can assist in providing guidance on the types of chemicals to use, the neutralization process, safety precautions, and any other relevant information. The model can generate detailed instructions or explanations based on the input provided, making the task more efficient and accurate.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the LLM can provide information and guidance on the task, it may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task by half. However, with additional software developed on top of the LLM, such as a specialized tool for chemical applications in laundry and dry-cleaning settings, the efficiency of completing the task could be improved.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** This task does not involve image processing or detailed visual instructions, so the image capabilities of the LLM would not significantly impact the completion of the task.
