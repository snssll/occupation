1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of guiding clients in gathering financial information as a Personal Financial Advisor, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be aided by the use of a large language model (LLM).

- Personal Financial Advisors often need to communicate clearly and provide detailed instructions to clients on what information they need to gather. An LLM can assist in generating clear and concise instructions for clients, ensuring that they understand what documents are required.
- The LLM can also help in creating templates or checklists for different types of financial information that need to be collected, making the process more efficient and organized.
- Additionally, the LLM can provide guidance on how to handle sensitive financial information and ensure compliance with regulations when gathering such data.

Based on these considerations, the task of guiding clients in gathering financial information as a Personal Financial Advisor could benefit significantly from the use of an LLM, as it can streamline communication, provide templates, and ensure compliance.
