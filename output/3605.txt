1: In this task, a Compensation and Benefits Manager is responsible for contracting with vendors to provide employee services such as food services, transportation, or relocation services. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- E0: This task involves human interaction, negotiation, and decision-making that require a high level of expertise and judgment. It also involves legal considerations and contractual agreements that may not be suitable for automation by an LLM.
- E1: While the task involves writing contracts and communicating with vendors, the negotiation aspect, understanding legal implications, and ensuring the best services for employees require human expertise and judgment. The LLM can assist in drafting contract language or providing templates, but the core aspects of negotiation and decision-making are best handled by a human.
- E2: Developing software on top of the LLM could potentially assist in summarizing vendor proposals, analyzing cost-benefit scenarios, or even suggesting contract clauses based on data. However, the complexity of negotiations, understanding employee needs, and ensuring vendor compliance may still require human intervention.
- E3: Image capabilities are not relevant for this task.

Based on the considerations above, the task of contracting with vendors to provide employee services is best classified as E2.

2: E2

3: Moderate
