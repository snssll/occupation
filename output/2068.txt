1: In this task of cleaning parts as an Electrical and Electronic Equipment Assembler, the exposure to LLM can be evaluated as follows:

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** The task of cleaning parts involves following a straightforward set of instructions and does not require complex decision-making or specialized knowledge beyond the general understanding of cleaning procedures. The LLM can provide guidance on the specific steps involved in cleaning parts, recommend appropriate cleaning solutions, and suggest best practices for efficient cleaning. The model can also assist in generating documentation related to cleaning procedures. Overall, the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality by providing detailed instructions and information.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the task of cleaning parts may not require additional software beyond the capabilities of the LLM itself, it is conceivable that specialized applications could be developed to streamline the cleaning process for specific types of electrical and electronic equipment. These applications could leverage the LLM's knowledge to provide tailored cleaning instructions based on the equipment being assembled. However, the development of such applications may not necessarily halve the time it takes to complete the task, as the core task remains relatively straightforward.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Image capabilities are not relevant to the task of cleaning parts in this context. The task primarily involves manual cleaning processes and does not require image analysis or creation.

Based on the above analysis, the most appropriate label for this task is **E1 (Direct exposure)**.

2: E1
