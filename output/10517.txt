1: In this task, the Surgical Technologists are required to observe patients' vital signs to assess their physical condition. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. Observing vital signs involves real-time monitoring of parameters like heart rate, blood pressure, temperature, and oxygen saturation. This task requires direct interaction with patients and physical equipment to measure these vital signs accurately. The task does not involve text-based information processing or analysis that could be easily automated by an LLM. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it cannot be significantly expedited or improved by the use of an LLM.
