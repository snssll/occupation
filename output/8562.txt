1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of investigating properties, origins, and activities of glaciers, ice, snow, and permafrost as a Hydrologist, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be supported by the capabilities of the LLM.

- The task involves researching and analyzing information related to glaciers, ice, snow, and permafrost. The LLM can assist in providing background information, definitions, and general knowledge about these topics.
- The LLM can help in summarizing existing research, providing insights into the properties and origins of glaciers, ice, snow, and permafrost based on available data.
- However, the task may require specialized domain knowledge, fieldwork, and access to specific datasets or research papers that the LLM alone may not have access to.
- While the LLM can provide general information and assist in generating initial insights, the task of investigating properties, origins, and activities of glaciers, ice, snow, and permafrost may require hands-on fieldwork, data collection, and analysis beyond the capabilities of the LLM.

Based on these considerations, the task of investigating properties, origins, and activities of glaciers, ice, snow, and permafrost as a Hydrologist would fall under label E2 - Exposure by LLM-powered applications.
