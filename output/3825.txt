1: In this task, a Welding, Soldering, and Brazing Machine Setter, Operator, or Tender needs to correct problems by adjusting controls or stopping machines. This task involves technical knowledge of machine operations and troubleshooting skills. While an LLM could potentially provide information on common problems and solutions in machine operation, it cannot physically adjust controls or stop machines. Therefore, the task does not involve writing, transforming text, summarizing documents, or any other text-based activities that an LLM could significantly assist with. As a result, this task falls under E0 as it does not clearly decrease the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete the task with high quality by at least half.

2: E0
