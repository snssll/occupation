1: In this task, a Data Warehousing Specialist is responsible for developing and implementing data extraction procedures from various systems. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves working with data extraction procedures, which may require writing and transforming text/code according to complex instructions.
- The task may involve analyzing existing systems and data structures to extract relevant information, which could benefit from the LLM's capabilities to provide insights and suggestions.
- While the task may not directly involve image capabilities, having access to the LLM could potentially assist in understanding and processing any accompanying documentation or data visualizations related to the systems being worked on.

Considering these points, the task could benefit from the LLM's ability to provide guidance, suggestions, and potentially assist in the development of data extraction procedures, making it suitable for an E1 label.
