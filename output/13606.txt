1: In this task, a lodging manager is responsible for purchasing supplies and arranging for various outside services. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be significantly expedited or improved by using the language model. 

- The task involves coordinating various services and purchases, which may require decision-making based on specific requirements and constraints. The LLM could potentially assist in generating lists of supplies needed based on historical data or industry standards.
- The language model could also help in drafting communication for service requests or orders, ensuring clarity and professionalism in written correspondence.
- Additionally, the LLM could provide insights into best practices for procurement, maintenance, and service arrangements based on a vast amount of text data it has processed.

Considering these points, the task could benefit from the LLM's capabilities in generating written content, providing recommendations, and offering insights based on textual data analysis.
