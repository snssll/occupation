1: In this task, the occupation of embalmers involves assisting coroners at death scenes or autopsies, filing police reports, and testifying at inquests or in court if employed by a coroner. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if the task can be significantly aided by the use of the LLM. The task involves practical, hands-on work that requires physical presence and interaction in sensitive and critical situations. The task also involves legal proceedings and testimonies, which require human judgment, empathy, and understanding of legal processes. The LLM, even with its text-based capabilities, cannot replace the physical and human aspects of this task. Therefore, the task falls under E0 as it does not significantly benefit from the use of the LLM.
