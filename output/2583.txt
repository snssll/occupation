1: In this task, a Gambling and Sports Book Writer and Runner is responsible for comparing the house hand with players' hands to determine the winner. To decide on the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. This task involves a straightforward comparison of hands in a gambling context, which primarily requires basic logic and knowledge of the rules of the game being played. The task does not involve complex decision-making, specialized domain knowledge beyond the rules of the game, or the need for up-to-date information. As such, the task does not significantly benefit from the capabilities of an LLM beyond what a human with basic knowledge in the field can already perform efficiently. Therefore, this task would fall under E0 as the use of an LLM would not substantially reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete the task with high quality.
