1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of negotiating details of contracts and payments as a Sales Representative, Wholesale and Manufacturing, Except Technical and Scientific Products, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it.

- E0: This task involves human interaction and negotiation, which typically requires nuanced understanding, empathy, and real-time decision-making. The LLM may not be able to fully capture the complexities of negotiation or provide the interpersonal skills needed for successful contract negotiations.

- E1: While the LLM can assist in drafting written correspondence related to negotiations, providing background information, or suggesting negotiation strategies based on input, the actual negotiation process involves dynamic interactions, non-verbal cues, and real-time decision-making that may not be effectively replicated by the LLM alone.

- E2: It is conceivable that additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to analyze contract terms, suggest negotiation tactics based on historical data, or provide real-time feedback during negotiations. However, the human element of negotiation, such as building rapport, understanding emotions, and adapting to the other party's responses, may still require human intervention.

- E3: Image capabilities would not significantly impact the negotiation of contracts and payments, as this task primarily involves verbal communication and document review rather than image processing.
