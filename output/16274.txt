1: In this task, a dishwasher is responsible for stocking supplies in various areas of a restaurant. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if the task can be significantly expedited or improved by using the LLM. The task itself is straightforward and primarily involves physical actions of stocking supplies. While the LLM could potentially provide guidance on organizing supplies or suggest efficient stocking methods, the core of the task still relies heavily on manual labor and physical presence. The LLM cannot physically stock supplies or interact with the environment to complete this task. Therefore, the task does not align with the capabilities of the LLM to a degree that would significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task.
