1: In this task, a critical care nurse is responsible for administering blood and blood products to patients while monitoring them for any signs of transfusion reactions. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves a high level of human interaction and physical care, which cannot be automated by an LLM. Additionally, the task requires real-time monitoring of patients' physical responses, which cannot be accurately assessed through text input alone. As a result, the task falls under the category of E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM or any tools built on top of it.
