1: In this task, an Aircraft Mechanic and Service Technician is required to locate and mark dimensions and reference lines on defective or replacement parts using various tools like templates, scribes, compasses, and steel rules. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. This task involves physical manipulation of parts and tools, precise measurements, and hands-on work that cannot be directly performed by an LLM. The task does not involve writing, transforming text, summarizing documents, or any other text-based activities that an LLM could assist with. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of an LLM or any tools built on top of it.
