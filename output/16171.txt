1: In this task, a Cooling and Freezing Equipment Operator and Tender is responsible for starting agitators or blades to mix contents in equipment to prevent sticking. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be completed more efficiently with the help of the LLM. Since this task involves physical actions like starting equipment and mixing contents, it does not seem like the LLM can directly assist in completing the task. The task requires hands-on operation of machinery, which is not something the LLM can perform. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not seem like the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task.

2: E0
