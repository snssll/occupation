1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of gathering, analyzing, or documenting user feedback as a Web Administrator, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves processing text-based user feedback to identify and address issues on a website. The LLM can assist in tasks such as analyzing text, summarizing information, providing feedback, and maintaining records of written data. In this case, the LLM can help in processing and analyzing the user feedback efficiently, potentially reducing the time needed to complete the task.

Given that the task primarily involves working with text data and does not require specialized domain knowledge or image capabilities, the LLM's text processing abilities can significantly aid in completing the task. The LLM can assist in summarizing feedback, identifying patterns, and generating reports based on the data provided. Therefore, the task falls under the category of E1 - Direct exposure, as direct access to the LLM can reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality by at least half.
