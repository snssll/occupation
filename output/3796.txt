1: In this task, a Government Property Inspector or Investigator is required to coordinate with or assist law enforcement agencies in matters of mutual concern. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves communication, coordination, and potentially sharing information with law enforcement agencies. While an LLM could assist in drafting emails or written communications related to coordination, it cannot actively engage in real-time coordination or assistance with law enforcement agencies. The task also involves sensitive information and legal implications that may require human judgment and decision-making. Therefore, the task does not fall under E1, E2, or E3 categories as the LLM alone cannot significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with high quality.

2: E0
