1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of collecting and analyzing field data related to energy usage as an Energy Auditor, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be impacted by the use of the LLM.

- Energy Auditors typically collect data on energy consumption, equipment efficiency, and building performance to identify opportunities for energy savings.
- The task involves gathering data from various sources, analyzing it to assess energy usage patterns, and making recommendations for improvements.
- The LLM could potentially assist in analyzing the collected data, providing insights into energy efficiency trends, and suggesting optimization strategies based on the data input.

Given these considerations, the task of collecting and analyzing field data related to energy usage could benefit from the LLM's capabilities in processing and interpreting data, which could streamline the analysis process and provide valuable insights to Energy Auditors.
