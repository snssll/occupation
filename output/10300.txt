1: In this task, a Continuous Mining Machine Operator is required to move levers to raise and lower hydraulic safety bars supporting roofs above machines until other workers complete framing. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. This task involves physical manipulation of machinery and coordination with other workers on-site. It does not involve writing, summarizing, analyzing text, or any other activity that can be directly assisted by an LLM. The task requires hands-on operation and real-time decision-making based on the physical environment, which cannot be effectively replaced by an LLM. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of an LLM or any tools built on top of it.
