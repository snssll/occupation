1: In this task of negotiating and arranging transport of goods with shipping or freight companies, the use of an LLM could potentially assist in various ways. The LLM could help in drafting emails or written correspondence to communicate with shipping or freight companies, providing information on industry standards or regulations related to cargo and freight, generating questions to ask during negotiations, summarizing documents related to transport agreements, and even providing recommendations based on data input regarding transport options. However, the task also involves a significant amount of human interaction and decision-making that may not be easily automated by the LLM alone. While the LLM can assist in certain aspects of the negotiation process, the final decisions and agreements would likely still require human judgment and expertise.
