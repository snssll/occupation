1: In this task, an actuary collaborates with various professionals to develop plans for new lines of business or improvements to existing business. To complete this task effectively, the actuary needs to analyze data, assess risks, and make recommendations based on their expertise in statistical and financial modeling. While the actuary may need to communicate with different team members and provide input on the financial aspects of the plans, the core of the task involves data analysis, risk assessment, and decision-making based on complex calculations.

Given the nature of the task, the actuary may benefit from using the LLM to assist in analyzing data, generating insights, and providing recommendations based on the information available. The LLM can help in processing large amounts of data, identifying trends, and potentially offering suggestions for improving business plans. However, the task also requires collaboration with other professionals and may involve specialized domain knowledge that the LLM alone may not possess.

Considering these factors, I would classify this task as E2 - Exposure by LLM-powered applications. While the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task, additional software built on top of the LLM could enhance data analysis, decision-making, and recommendation generation, ultimately streamlining the process.
