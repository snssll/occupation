1: In this task, the occupation of Helpers--Electricians involves assisting electricians in various tasks, including raising, lowering, or positioning equipment, tools, and materials using hoists, hand lines, or block and tackle. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be significantly expedited or improved by using the language model. Since the task involves physical actions such as operating hoists and block and tackle, it does not directly involve text-based activities that the LLM can assist with. The LLM cannot physically manipulate equipment or tools, so it cannot directly impact the completion of this task.
