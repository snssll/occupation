1: In this task, an Exercise Trainer or Group Fitness Instructor is required to advise clients about proper clothing and shoes. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. Advising clients about proper clothing and shoes involves providing recommendations based on general knowledge and expertise in fitness and exercise. This task primarily involves written communication and does not require specialized domain knowledge beyond what a typical fitness professional would possess. The task does not involve complex data analysis, highly specialized information retrieval, or the need for image capabilities. Therefore, the task falls under E1 as it can be effectively completed by utilizing the LLM to provide written advice to clients.
