1: In this task, a Real Estate Sales Agent is required to contact previous clients to generate referral business. With access to the LLM, the agent could potentially use the model to draft personalized emails or messages to send to previous clients, saving time on composing individual messages. The LLM could also assist in crafting persuasive language to encourage referrals. However, the task itself involves human interaction and relationship-building, which cannot be fully automated by the LLM. While the LLM can aid in the initial communication, the actual relationship-building and negotiation for referrals would still require human touch and personalized interactions. Therefore, the task does not significantly benefit from the LLM in a way that would reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete it by at least half.
