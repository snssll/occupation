1: In this task, a Freight Forwarder is responsible for coordinating the movement of goods across international borders by working with customs brokers to ensure smooth customs clearance. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could assist in completing it. 

- E0: This task involves direct interaction with customs brokers and navigating complex customs regulations, which may require human judgment and negotiation skills. The LLM may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task, as it involves real-time communication and decision-making that cannot be fully automated.
- E1: The LLM could potentially assist in drafting communication with customs brokers, summarizing relevant regulations, or providing background information on customs procedures. However, the negotiation and coordination aspects of the task may still require human intervention and expertise.
- E2: While the LLM alone may not be able to reduce the time significantly for this task, additional software could be developed to streamline communication with customs brokers, automate certain documentation processes, or provide real-time updates on customs regulations. Such software could enhance the efficiency of coordinating customs clearance.
- E3: The task does not involve image processing or detailed visual information, so the image capabilities of the LLM would not significantly impact the completion of this task.

Based on the considerations above, the most fitting exposure label for this task is E2.

2: E2

3: Moderate
