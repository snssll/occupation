1: In this task, the Agricultural Equipment Operator is responsible for loading and unloading crops or containers of materials using various equipment such as conveyors, handtrucks, forklifts, or transfer augers. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality.

- E0: This task involves physical labor and operating machinery, which cannot be directly assisted by the LLM. The task requires hands-on work and precise movements that cannot be replaced by text-based assistance.

- E1: The task description does not involve complex text-based instructions, writing, or information retrieval that the LLM could significantly assist with. The task is more focused on physical actions rather than text-based tasks.

- E2: While it's conceivable that software could be developed to provide guidance or instructions related to loading and unloading processes, the core task of physically handling equipment and materials remains outside the scope of what the LLM can directly assist with.

- E3: The task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images, so the image capabilities of the LLM are not relevant here.

2: E0

3: High
