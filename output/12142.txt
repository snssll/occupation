1: In this task, a Pest Control Worker is required to position and fasten edges of tarpaulins over a building, tape vents to ensure an air-tight environment, and check for leaks. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves physical work such as positioning and fastening tarpaulins, which cannot be directly assisted by the LLM.
- The task also requires checking for leaks, which involves manual inspection and decision-making based on physical observations.
- While the LLM could potentially provide information on pest control methods or safety precautions, it cannot directly assist in the physical aspects of the task.

Based on these considerations, the task does not involve text-based activities that can be significantly aided by the LLM. Therefore, the task falls under E0 as it does not meet the criteria for exposure to LLM.
