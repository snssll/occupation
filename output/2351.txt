1: In this task, a Cleaner of Vehicles and Equipment is required to collect and test samples of cleaning solutions or vapors. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality by at least half.

- The task involves physical actions such as collecting samples, which cannot be directly assisted by the LLM.
- Testing samples may involve specialized equipment and procedures that the LLM cannot perform.
- The task does not involve text input or output that the LLM can directly assist with.
- There are no clear ways in which the LLM or LLM-powered tools could automate or assist in the collection and testing of samples of cleaning solutions or vapors.

Based on these considerations, it is evident that the task of collecting and testing samples of cleaning solutions or vapors does not have exposure to LLM capabilities that would significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task.
