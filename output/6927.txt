1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of filing and maintaining records as a Receptionist or Information Clerk, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be impacted by the use of the LLM.

- Filing and maintaining records involve organizing and storing information in a systematic manner. This task is primarily text-based and involves managing written data.
- The LLM can assist in tasks related to written data, such as organizing, summarizing, and retrieving information.
- The LLM can be used to generate templates for record-keeping, provide suggestions for efficient organization, and even automate certain aspects of record maintenance.
- While the task itself is not highly complex, the LLM can significantly reduce the time required for manual data entry and organization, improving efficiency and accuracy.

Based on these considerations, the task of filing and maintaining records as a Receptionist or Information Clerk would likely fall under the E1 label. The LLM can streamline the process, provide suggestions, and automate certain aspects of record-keeping, leading to a significant time-saving with equivalent quality.
