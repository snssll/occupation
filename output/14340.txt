1: In this task, an Animal Control Worker is responsible for removing captured animals from animal-control service vehicles and placing them in shelter cages or other enclosures. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. This task involves physical interaction with animals, handling them, and placing them in specific locations. It does not involve complex written or spoken communication, data analysis, or decision-making based on information processed by an LLM. The task is primarily manual and requires physical dexterity and knowledge of animal behavior.

Given that the task does not involve text input or output, does not require complex decision-making based on information processed by an LLM, and is primarily physical in nature, it does not align with the capabilities of an LLM. Therefore, the task falls under E0 as it does not benefit from exposure to an LLM.
