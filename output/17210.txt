1: In this task, the First-Line Supervisors of Food Preparation and Serving Workers are responsible for training workers in various aspects related to food preparation, service, sanitation, and safety procedures. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be significantly aided by the use of the language model. The LLM can assist in providing detailed instructions, creating training materials, summarizing information related to food preparation and safety procedures, and generating questions for assessments. Since the task involves a lot of written communication and knowledge sharing, the LLM can be used to streamline these processes, making it easier to train workers effectively.

Considering the nature of the task and the potential for the LLM to assist in creating training materials, providing feedback, and generating relevant content, it is likely that this task falls under E1 - Direct exposure.
