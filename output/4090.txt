1: In this task, a Drywall and Ceiling Tile Installer is required to cut fixture or border tiles to size using keyhole saws and insert them into surrounding frameworks. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves manual labor that requires physical skills such as cutting tiles to size and inserting them into frameworks. This task does not involve text input or output that can be easily processed by an LLM.
- The task does not involve complex decision-making, analysis of data, or specialized knowledge that would benefit significantly from LLM capabilities.
- While an LLM could potentially provide information on techniques or best practices for tile installation, the core task of physically cutting and inserting tiles is not something that an LLM can directly assist with.

Based on these considerations, it is clear that the task of cutting and inserting tiles does not align with the capabilities of an LLM, and therefore falls under the E0 label.
