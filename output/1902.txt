1: In this task, a choreographer is required to choose the music, sound effects, or spoken narrative to accompany a dance. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM can assist in completing it. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM can help in generating ideas for music, sound effects, or narratives that could accompany a dance. It can provide suggestions based on the mood, theme, or style of the dance. The LLM can also assist in crafting written narratives or descriptions to complement the choreography.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM can provide creative input and suggestions, there may not be specific software developed on top of the LLM that significantly reduces the time it takes to complete this task by half. However, with further development, specialized tools could be created to streamline the process of selecting music, sound effects, or narratives for dance performances.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not relevant to this task as it primarily involves selecting audio elements to accompany a dance, rather than dealing with visual content.
