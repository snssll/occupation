1: Analyzing x-rays to locate sources of patients' difficulties and ruling out fractures or diseases as sources of problems is a task that requires specialized medical knowledge and expertise. While an LLM could potentially assist in providing general information about interpreting x-rays, it lacks the ability to accurately diagnose medical conditions or rule out specific issues based on x-ray images. This task involves precise measurements, detailed medical knowledge, and the ability to make critical decisions based on the analysis of x-rays, which are beyond the capabilities of the LLM. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it cannot be effectively completed by the LLM alone.
