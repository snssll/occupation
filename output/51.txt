1: In this task, the Solar Photovoltaic Installers are required to activate PV systems to ensure they are functioning correctly and meeting performance standards. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be significantly expedited or improved by using the language model. 

- The task involves technical knowledge and hands-on work related to activating PV systems, which cannot be directly assisted by an LLM.
- The task requires physical interaction with the systems to verify functionality, which cannot be replaced by text-based assistance from an LLM.
- The task involves practical skills and real-time assessment of system performance, which an LLM cannot directly contribute to.

Based on these considerations, it is clear that the task of activating PV systems does not align with any of the exposure levels (E0, E1, E2, E3) as it does not involve text-based tasks that an LLM can assist with.

2: E0

3: High
