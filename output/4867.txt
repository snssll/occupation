1: In this task, a recreational therapist is responsible for developing discharge plans for patients. This involves assessing the patient's progress, determining their needs post-discharge, coordinating with other healthcare professionals, and ensuring a smooth transition out of the healthcare facility. To complete this task, the therapist needs to consider the patient's physical and mental health, social support systems, financial resources, and any specific requirements for ongoing care or therapy.

To determine the appropriate exposure label for this task:
- E0: This task involves a high degree of human interaction and decision-making based on individual patient needs. It requires personalized care planning and coordination, which cannot be fully automated by an LLM.
- E1: While the LLM could potentially assist in drafting some parts of the discharge plan or providing general information on post-discharge resources, the complexity of individual patient needs and the need for personalized care planning make it unlikely that the LLM alone could reduce the time to complete this task by at least half with equivalent quality.
- E2: It is conceivable that additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to streamline certain aspects of discharge planning, such as generating template plans, providing general resources, or organizing information. However, the core of the task still requires human expertise and decision-making that goes beyond what the LLM can provide.
- E3: The task does not involve image processing capabilities, so this label does not apply.

2: E0

3: High
