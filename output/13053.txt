1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of producing a computer-generated or film image for interpretation by a physician as a Nuclear Medicine Technologist, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves creating visual images based on specific instructions, which falls under the category of creating or editing digital images according to instructions. Since the LLM does not have image capabilities on its own, we would need additional software that can view, caption, and create images to assist in completing this task. This additional software could potentially be developed on top of the LLM to reduce the time it takes to complete the task by half.
