1: In this task, a Paperhanger applies thinned glue to waterproof porous surfaces using brushes, rollers, or pasting machines. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality by at least half.

- The task involves physical work such as applying glue to surfaces, which cannot be directly assisted by the LLM.
- The task requires manual dexterity and physical coordination, which are not within the capabilities of the LLM.
- The task does not involve complex decision-making, analysis, or information retrieval that would benefit significantly from LLM capabilities.
- The task is practical and hands-on, with no direct connection to text-based or information-related processes that the LLM excels at.

Based on these considerations, it is clear that the task of applying thinned glue to surfaces as a Paperhanger falls under the E0 category as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM to provide a significant reduction in time for completion.
