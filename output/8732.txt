1: In this task, a stonemason is required to lay bricks to build structures like chimneys, smokestacks, and industrial installations. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes for a stonemason to complete this task with high quality. The task involves physical construction work that requires precise measurements, manual labor, and hands-on skills. The LLM cannot physically lay bricks or interact with physical materials, making it unsuitable for directly assisting with this task. Additionally, the task does not involve written or spoken communication that the LLM could assist with. Therefore, the task does not align with any of the exposure labels provided.
