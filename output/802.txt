1: In this task, a dental hygienist applies fluorides or other cavity-preventing agents to patients to help prevent dental decay. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes for a dental hygienist to complete this task with equivalent quality. The task itself is hands-on and requires physical interaction with patients, which cannot be replaced by text-based interactions with the LLM. The LLM cannot physically apply treatments to patients, and the task involves precise measurements and direct human contact, making it unsuitable for automation through text-based tools. Therefore, the task falls under E0 as it does not meet the criteria for exposure to LLM capabilities.
