1: In this task, the Agricultural Equipment Operator is required to position boxes or attach bags at the discharge ends of machinery to catch products, remove and close full containers. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. This task involves physical actions such as positioning boxes, attaching bags, and removing containers, which cannot be directly performed by an LLM. The task does not involve complex decision-making, specialized knowledge retrieval, or detailed data analysis that would benefit significantly from LLM capabilities. Therefore, this task does not align with any of the exposure levels in the rubric.

2: E0
