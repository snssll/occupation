1: In this task, a Sales Representative of Services would need to consult with clients after sales or contract signings to resolve problems and provide ongoing support. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we can break down the task:
- The task involves written communication with clients to address issues and provide support.
- The LLM can assist in drafting responses, providing suggestions for problem resolution, and generating support materials.
- The task does not require specialized domain knowledge beyond general sales and customer service practices.
- The LLM can help in maintaining records of client interactions and support provided.

Based on these considerations, the task falls under E1 as the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to draft responses, provide support materials, and maintain records, all of which are crucial aspects of consulting with clients after sales.
