1: In this task, an Airfield Operations Specialist is responsible for initiating or conducting airport-wide coordination of snow removal on runways and taxiways. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it. 

- E0: This task involves physical coordination and management of snow removal operations at an airport, which requires on-site presence and real-time decision-making. The task also involves interacting with various personnel and equipment on the ground, which cannot be replaced by the LLM.

- E1: While the LLM could potentially provide information on best practices for snow removal or help draft communication messages for coordination, the core aspect of physically coordinating snow removal operations at an airport cannot be effectively automated by the LLM alone. The real-time nature of the task and the need for on-site presence make it challenging for the LLM to significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task.

- E2: It is conceivable that specialized software could be developed on top of the LLM to assist in generating snow removal operation plans, analyzing weather data, or providing recommendations based on historical data. However, the real-time coordination aspect of the task still heavily relies on human judgment and physical presence, making it unlikely that the LLM alone would reduce the time to complete the task by half.

- E3: The task does not involve image processing or analysis that would significantly benefit from additional image capabilities beyond the LLM's text-based capabilities.
