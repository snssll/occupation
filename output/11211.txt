1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of participating in informal appeals hearings on contested cases as a Tax Examiner or Revenue Agent, we need to consider the level of exposure to LLM. 

- E0: This task involves human interaction and decision-making that impacts legal matters, making it unsuitable for automation by the LLM.
- E1: The LLM could potentially assist in preparing written materials for the appeals hearings, such as drafting responses or summarizing key points. However, the task itself involves active participation in hearings, which requires human judgment and interaction.
- E2: While the LLM could help in summarizing relevant tax laws or regulations, providing background information on cases, or drafting documents, the core task of participating in appeals hearings involves nuanced discussions, understanding of legal arguments, and making decisions based on the presented information. It is challenging to automate this level of interaction and decision-making solely with the LLM.
- E3: The task does not involve image processing capabilities, so exposure to LLM with image capabilities is not relevant in this context.

Based on the above analysis, the task of participating in informal appeals hearings on contested cases as a Tax Examiner or Revenue Agent is best classified as E0.
