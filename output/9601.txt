1: In this task, a hydrologist is required to measure and graph various water-related phenomena such as lake levels, stream flows, and changes in water volumes. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone or with additional software could significantly reduce the time it takes for a hydrologist to complete this task with equivalent quality.

- E0: This task involves physical measurements of natural phenomena such as lake levels and stream flows, which cannot be directly performed by the LLM or any software tool. The task also requires specialized knowledge and skills in hydrology that go beyond what the LLM can provide.

- E1: The LLM could potentially assist in generating reports, analyzing data, or providing background information on hydrological concepts. However, the core task of physically measuring and graphing water phenomena would still require manual work by the hydrologist. Therefore, the time savings with the LLM alone would not be significant enough to warrant an E1 label.

- E2: While the LLM could potentially help in summarizing research papers, providing context on specific hydrological topics, or even suggesting data visualization techniques, the task of measuring and graphing water phenomena is highly specialized and requires hands-on fieldwork. Developing software that could automate the physical measurements and graphing process would be challenging and may not be feasible with current technology.

- E3: The task does not involve image processing or detailed visual analysis that would benefit from additional image capabilities. Therefore, the E3 label does not apply to this task.

2: E0
