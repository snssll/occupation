1: In this task, a transportation engineer is required to evaluate transportation systems, traffic control devices, or lighting systems to determine if modifications or expansions are needed. To complete this task, the engineer would need to analyze data related to traffic flow, safety, efficiency, and other factors. The engineer may also need to consider factors such as population growth, urban development, and technological advancements impacting transportation systems. 

Using an LLM, the engineer could potentially access information on best practices in transportation engineering, case studies of successful system modifications, and emerging technologies in the field. The LLM could assist in providing insights into traffic patterns, safety considerations, and potential solutions for system improvements. However, the task also involves a significant amount of data analysis, technical knowledge, and on-site evaluations that may not be fully supported by the LLM alone.
