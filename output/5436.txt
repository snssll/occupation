1: In this task, the Rolling Machine Setters, Operators, and Tenders, Metal and Plastic are required to direct and train other workers on various operations related to mill equipment. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be significantly expedited or improved by using the language model. The task involves providing instructions, training materials, and possibly documentation. An LLM could potentially assist in creating training materials, writing instructions, or generating documentation. However, since the task involves hands-on training and physical operations like changing rolls and loading materials, the direct application of LLM may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task.
