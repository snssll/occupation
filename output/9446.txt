1: In this task, an Agent or Business Manager is responsible for managing the business and financial affairs of artists, performers, and athletes. This includes tasks such as arranging travel and lodging, selling tickets, and directing marketing and advertising activities. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete these tasks with equivalent quality.

- The task involves a high level of human interaction and decision-making, especially when it comes to negotiating deals, understanding the specific needs and preferences of clients, and making strategic business decisions.
- While the LLM can provide information and assist in drafting documents or communications, the core functions of managing business and financial affairs require a deep understanding of the industry, personal relationships, and negotiation skills that are beyond the capabilities of the LLM.
- The task also involves handling sensitive financial information and making critical decisions that could impact the livelihood and success of the clients. These decisions require human judgment, experience, and expertise.

Based on these considerations, the task of managing business and financial affairs for clients in the field of entertainment and sports is best classified as E0 - No exposure to LLM.
