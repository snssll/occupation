1: In this task, a Financial Manager is responsible for submitting delinquent accounts to attorneys or outside agencies for collection. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves a straightforward action based on a predefined criterion (submitting delinquent accounts), which can be easily articulated in text form.
- The task does not require specialized domain knowledge beyond financial management, which the LLM can handle effectively.
- The task does not involve complex decision-making or nuanced human interactions that would require human judgment.
- The task does not involve precise measurements or detailed visual analysis.

Considering these points, the task can be effectively completed with the help of the LLM by providing clear instructions for submitting delinquent accounts. The LLM can generate the necessary text for communication with attorneys or outside agencies, making the process more efficient.
