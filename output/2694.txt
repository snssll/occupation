1: In this task, a Credit Analyst is responsible for completing loan applications, conducting credit analyses, summarizing loan requests, and submitting them to loan committees for approval. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task and how an LLM could assist in completing it. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The task involves writing and transforming text (loan applications, credit analyses, summaries) according to complex instructions. An LLM could assist in generating text for these documents based on the provided information, potentially speeding up the process and ensuring accuracy. Additionally, the LLM could help in providing feedback on the documents or answering questions related to them.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While an LLM alone could assist in generating text for loan applications and summaries, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to further streamline the process. For example, specialized software could be created to retrieve up-to-date financial data or industry trends to incorporate into the credit analysis, enhancing the quality and relevance of the submissions.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not relevant to this task as it primarily involves text-based documents (loan applications, credit analyses).

Based on the above analysis, the task of completing loan applications, conducting credit analyses, summarizing loan requests, and submitting them to loan committees for approval would likely fall under E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications.
