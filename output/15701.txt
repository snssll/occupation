1: In this task of servicing vehicles with gas, oil, and water, the main activities involve physical actions such as refueling, checking oil levels, and filling up water reservoirs. These actions cannot be directly performed by an LLM or any software tool based on it. The task requires hands-on work and direct interaction with vehicles, making it unsuitable for automation through text-based tools like the LLM. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not benefit from exposure to the LLM.
