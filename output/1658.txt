1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of calculating potential solar resources or solar array production for a particular site as a Solar Sales Representative and Assessor, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves analyzing various factors such as climate, shading, and roof orientation to estimate solar energy production. The LLM can assist in providing information on solar energy, climate data, and potentially even general guidance on solar panel placement based on the input provided. However, the task also requires specialized knowledge in solar energy systems, site assessment, and calculations that may not be within the LLM's expertise. While the LLM can help with some aspects of the task, it may not have the specific domain knowledge required to accurately calculate solar array production for a particular site.
