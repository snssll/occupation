1: In this task, a receptionist or information clerk is responsible for scheduling space or equipment for special programs and preparing lists of participants. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we can break down the task:
- Scheduling space or equipment for special programs involves coordinating logistics, checking availability, and ensuring everything is set up correctly.
- Preparing lists of participants involves organizing information, updating lists, and potentially communicating with participants.

Given that this task involves primarily text-based activities such as organizing information, communicating, and coordinating logistics, it falls under the realm of tasks that can be efficiently handled by an LLM. The LLM can assist in drafting emails, updating lists, summarizing information, and providing recommendations based on the input data.
