1: In this task, the occupation involves installing, servicing, and repairing electronic equipment like televisions, radios, and videocassette recorders. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if the task can be significantly expedited or improved by using the LLM. Given that the task involves physical installation, servicing, and repair of electronic equipment, which requires hands-on work, precise measurements, and potentially troubleshooting hardware issues, it is unlikely that the LLM or any tools built on top of it could reduce the time it takes to complete the task by at least half. The LLM does not have the capability to physically interact with equipment or perform repairs. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not meet the criteria for exposure to LLM.

2: E0
