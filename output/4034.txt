1: In this task, an Atmospheric and Space Scientist is required to create visualizations to illustrate historical or future changes in the Earth's climate using paleoclimate or climate geographic information systems (GIS) databases. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM and any additional tools that could be developed on top of it.

- The task involves creating visualizations, which may not directly benefit from the text-based capabilities of the LLM.
- However, if there were a system that could view, caption, and create images based on the data provided to the LLM, it could potentially assist in generating visualizations.
- This task does not involve detailed measurements or interactions that would require human involvement.
- While the LLM itself may not significantly reduce the time to complete this task, the development of a system that can work with images and data from the LLM could potentially streamline the visualization creation process.

Based on these considerations, this task falls under label E2 - Exposure by LLM-powered applications.

2: E2

3: Moderate
