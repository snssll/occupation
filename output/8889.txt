1: Hazardous Materials Removal Workers are responsible for safely removing hazardous materials from various sites. One of the tasks they perform is loading or unloading materials into containers or trucks using hoists or forklifts. This task involves physical labor and requires manual dexterity and spatial awareness to ensure the materials are handled safely. Since this task involves physical actions and does not primarily rely on text-based information processing, it is unlikely that the LLM or any tools built on top of it could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task. Therefore, this task would be classified as E0 as it does not meet the criteria for exposure to LLM capabilities.

2: E0

3: High
