1: In this task, a Radiologic Technologist or Technician is required to review and evaluate developed x-rays, video tape, or computer-generated information to determine if images are satisfactory for diagnostic purposes. This task involves analyzing visual information (x-rays, video tape, computer-generated images) to make a judgment based on their expertise. The task does not involve text input or output, and the information being analyzed is visual in nature, which cannot be processed by the LLM directly. Therefore, the task does not fall under E1, E2, or E3 exposure categories as the LLM cannot directly assist in completing this task.
