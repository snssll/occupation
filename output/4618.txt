1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of determining patterns of building use for energy needs as an Energy Auditor, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves analyzing data related to building use to identify trends in energy consumption. The LLM can assist in processing and analyzing textual data related to energy consumption patterns, providing insights based on the input data. This task does not involve precise measurements or detailed visuals, and the LLM can handle text-based information effectively.

Given that the LLM can assist in processing and analyzing textual data to identify patterns in energy consumption, this task falls under E1. The LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to analyze and interpret the data, providing valuable insights for Energy Auditors.
