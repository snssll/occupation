1: In this task, a Loan Interviewer or Clerk is responsible for ordering property insurance or mortgage insurance policies to protect against loss on mortgaged property. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the complexity of the task and whether the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete it with equivalent quality.

- The task involves understanding insurance policies, property protection, and mortgage processes, which may require domain-specific knowledge.
- The task also involves specific instructions and regulations that need to be followed when ordering insurance policies.
- The LLM can assist in providing general information about property insurance, mortgage insurance, and related processes.
- The LLM can help generate template emails or documents for ordering insurance policies based on provided information.
- The LLM may not have access to real-time insurance policy data or specific details required for ordering policies unless provided in the input.

Considering these points, the task can benefit from the LLM's ability to provide information and generate text but may require additional domain-specific knowledge and real-time data access, which the LLM may not have. Therefore, this task falls under label E2 - Exposure by LLM-powered applications.
