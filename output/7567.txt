1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of immersing a pipe in a chemical solution to remove dirt, oil, and scale, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task itself is physical and requires manual labor, which cannot be directly performed by the LLM. The LLM does not have the ability to interact with physical objects or perform tasks that require physical manipulation. Therefore, the task falls under the category of manual labor that cannot be automated by the LLM or any software built on top of it. As a result, the task does not benefit from exposure to the LLM in any way, making it a clear case for E0.

2: E0

3: High
