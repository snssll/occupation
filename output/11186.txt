1: In this task, a Sports Medicine Physician is required to participate in continuing education activities to enhance and maintain their knowledge and skills. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves reading and potentially summarizing information from various sources related to sports medicine.
- The task may require the physician to engage in written communication, such as writing reports or notes during the educational activities.
- The task does not involve any visual elements or detailed image analysis.
- The task does not require specialized domain knowledge retrieval beyond what the LLM can provide.

Based on these considerations, the task of participating in continuing education activities to improve and maintain knowledge and skills falls under E1. The LLM can assist in summarizing information, providing feedback on written content, and generating questions or responses related to the educational activities.
