1: In this task, a nurse practitioner is required to perform routine or annual physical examinations. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves conducting physical examinations on patients, which requires hands-on interaction and assessment of the patient's physical health. This task cannot be completed solely through text input and output, as it involves physical contact and observation that an LLM cannot perform. Therefore, the task falls under E0 as it does not benefit from the capabilities of the LLM.
