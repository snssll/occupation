1: In this task, a Software Quality Assurance Analyst and Tester is required to recommend the purchase of equipment to control dust, temperature, or humidity in the area of system installation. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves analyzing the environmental conditions of a system installation area and making a recommendation based on that analysis.
- The task does not require specialized domain knowledge beyond what the LLM can provide.
- The task does not involve detailed visual analysis or physical measurements.
- The task is primarily text-based and involves decision-making based on information provided in the text.

Based on these considerations, the task can be effectively completed with the help of the LLM, as it involves analyzing information and making a recommendation based on that analysis, which falls within the capabilities of the LLM. Therefore, this task falls under label E1 as direct access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality.
