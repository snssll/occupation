1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of attending investment briefings or consulting financial media to stay abreast of relevant investment markets as an Investment Fund Manager, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be impacted by the use of an LLM.

- E0: This task involves attending briefings and consulting financial media, which are activities that require human interaction and decision-making based on real-time information. While an LLM could potentially assist in summarizing information or providing insights, the core task of attending briefings and staying updated on investment markets is not something that can be significantly expedited by the use of an LLM.

- E1: The task involves staying informed about relevant investment markets, which could involve reading and synthesizing information from various sources. An LLM could assist in summarizing key points from briefings or articles, providing insights, or even generating questions for further research. However, the direct impact of using an LLM in this task may not reduce the time it takes to stay updated significantly.

- E2: While an LLM alone may not reduce the time it takes to attend briefings or consult financial media, additional software built on top of the LLM could potentially be developed to summarize lengthy reports, analyze market trends, or provide recommendations based on the information gathered. Such software could enhance the efficiency of staying abreast of investment markets.

- E3: The task does not involve image-related activities, so the use of image capabilities alongside an LLM would not significantly impact the time it takes to attend briefings or consult financial media for an Investment Fund Manager.
