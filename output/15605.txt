1: In this task, the Automotive and Watercraft Service Attendant is responsible for selling and installing accessories like batteries, windshield wiper blades, fan belts, bulbs, or headlamps. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves physical actions such as selling and installing accessories, which cannot be directly performed by an LLM. While the LLM could potentially provide information on these accessories, it cannot physically sell or install them. Therefore, the task does not involve text-based activities that can be significantly enhanced by the LLM. As a result, this task falls under E0 as it does not benefit from LLM capabilities in reducing the time it takes to complete the task.

2: E0
