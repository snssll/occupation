1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of assessing students' progress throughout tutoring sessions for the occupation of Tutors, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be supported by the capabilities of the LLM.

- Assessing students' progress involves tracking and evaluating their development over time, which requires understanding their strengths, weaknesses, and areas of improvement.
- The LLM can assist in generating reports or summaries based on the input data provided about each student's progress.
- The LLM can help in analyzing trends, identifying patterns, and providing insights based on the information given.
- However, the task of assessing students' progress may involve subjective judgment, nuanced understanding of individual student needs, and real-time interactions that the LLM may not be able to fully capture.
- While the LLM can process text input and provide analysis, it may not have the contextual understanding or personal touch required for effective student assessment in a tutoring setting.

Based on these considerations, the task of assessing students' progress throughout tutoring sessions would likely fall under E2 - Exposure by LLM-powered applications. While the LLM can assist in data analysis and report generation, additional software tailored to the specific needs of student assessment in a tutoring context could further enhance the efficiency of this task.
