1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of negotiating contracts for services or materials needed for environmental remediation as a Brownfield Redevelopment Specialist or Site Manager, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it.

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM could assist in drafting and refining negotiation proposals, analyzing contract terms, providing suggestions for negotiation strategies, and crafting effective communication to reach agreements. The LLM's language generation capabilities could significantly reduce the time needed to prepare for negotiations and respond to counteroffers.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not reduce the time to complete the negotiation process by half, additional software could be developed to integrate the LLM's capabilities with real-time market data, legal databases, and negotiation best practices. This software could provide recommendations based on current market trends, legal requirements, and successful negotiation tactics, enhancing the negotiation process.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities would not significantly impact the negotiation of contracts for services or materials, as this task primarily involves written communication and analysis of contract terms rather than visual information.
