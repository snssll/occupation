1: In this task, a Stocker or Order Filler is responsible for stamping, attaching, or changing price tags on merchandise based on a price list. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. This task involves straightforward instructions that can be easily followed by a human worker without the need for complex decision-making or specialized knowledge. The task does not require accessing up-to-date information or highly specialized domain knowledge. 

Given that the task involves basic instructions and does not require advanced reasoning or decision-making, it is unlikely that access to an LLM would significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task. The task is manual and repetitive in nature, focusing on physical actions rather than cognitive processing or complex analysis. Therefore, the task falls under E0 as the use of an LLM or LLM-powered tool would not substantially decrease the time needed for an experienced worker to complete the task.
