With access to the most powerful OpenAI large language model (LLM), the analyst could use the model to generate templates for communication, draft emails or messages, summarize information gathered from these interactions, and even analyze the data obtained to identify trends. The LLM could assist in crafting responses to inquiries, drafting reports based on the information gathered, and even providing insights into the data collected from these communications. Overall, the LLM could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task by providing support in various aspects of communication and analysis.
