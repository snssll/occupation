1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of developing strategies for more environmentally friendly resource extraction and reclamation as a Geoscientist, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM can assist in completing it. Geoscientists typically require a deep understanding of geology, environmental science, and resource management to develop such strategies. The task involves analyzing complex data, understanding environmental impacts, and proposing sustainable solutions.

- E0: This task involves a high level of expertise in geoscience and environmental science, which may not be easily replaced by the LLM alone. The task requires specialized knowledge and experience that the LLM may not possess.

- E1: The LLM can assist in providing general information on environmentally friendly practices in resource extraction and reclamation. It can help in generating ideas, summarizing existing research, and providing insights based on the input data. However, the task also requires domain-specific knowledge and expertise that the LLM may not have.

- E2: While the LLM can provide general information and insights, developing specific strategies for environmentally friendly resource extraction and reclamation may require specialized domain knowledge that goes beyond the capabilities of the LLM alone. Additional software that integrates data analysis, environmental modeling, and resource management tools could enhance the efficiency of completing this task.

- E3: The task does not involve image capabilities, so this label does not apply.

Based on the analysis, the most appropriate label for this task is E2.

2: E2

3: Moderate
