1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of collecting information about waste stream management or green building practices to inform decision makers as a Sustainability Specialist, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves researching and gathering data on specific sustainability topics to provide insights for decision-making. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM can assist in researching and summarizing information related to waste stream management and green building practices. It can help in collecting relevant data, analyzing trends, and presenting findings in a coherent manner. The task primarily involves text-based research and analysis, which aligns well with the LLM's capabilities.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone can provide valuable assistance in gathering information, additional software could be developed to streamline the process further. For instance, a specialized tool could be created to automatically retrieve up-to-date data on waste stream management and green building practices from various sources, which could enhance the efficiency of the research process.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not directly relevant to the task of collecting information about waste stream management or green building practices. The task primarily involves text-based research and data analysis, which can be effectively handled by the LLM without the need for image capabilities.

Based on the above analysis, the task of collecting information about waste stream management or green building practices to inform decision makers as a Sustainability Specialist is best classified as **E1: Direct exposure**.
