1: In this task, a Solar Photovoltaic Installer is required to demonstrate the functionality and performance of a solar PV system, including various operations like start-up, shut-down, normal operation, and emergency or bypass operations. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality.

- The task involves practical, hands-on work that requires physical interaction with the solar PV system.
- The task also involves demonstrating the system's functionality, which may require real-time adjustments and troubleshooting based on the system's response.
- The LLM, even with its text-based capabilities, cannot physically interact with the system or assess its real-time performance.

Based on these considerations, it is evident that the task of demonstrating system functionality and performance for Solar Photovoltaic Installers falls under E0 as it involves physical, hands-on work that cannot be significantly aided by the LLM alone.
