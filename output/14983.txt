1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of reviewing blueprints, sketches, or work orders as a Timing Device Assembler and Adjuster, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be aided by the use of a large language model (LLM).

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** If the task involves analyzing and interpreting text-based information from blueprints, sketches, or work orders, an LLM could significantly reduce the time it takes to gather relevant information by providing quick summaries, clarifications, or additional context based on the input provided. The LLM could assist in extracting key details, identifying patterns, or even suggesting potential adjustments based on the information presented.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the task itself may not be directly reducible to half the time with just the LLM, it is conceivable that additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to enhance the efficiency of reviewing and interpreting technical documents like blueprints. This software could potentially offer advanced summarization, cross-referencing with relevant databases, or even real-time collaboration features to streamline the information gathering process.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Since the task involves reviewing visual materials like blueprints and sketches, having access to image capabilities alongside the LLM could further expedite the process. The combined use of text and image analysis tools could assist in extracting information from diagrams, identifying components, or even generating annotations to aid in understanding the technical details presented in the visual materials.
