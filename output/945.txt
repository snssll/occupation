1: In this task, a Sales Engineer is responsible for arranging demonstrations or trial installations of equipment. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- Direct exposure (E1): The task involves coordinating and organizing demonstrations or trial installations, which primarily require communication skills and logistical coordination. An LLM could potentially assist in drafting emails, scheduling appointments, or providing templates for demonstration arrangements. However, the task does not heavily rely on complex text generation or analysis that would significantly benefit from direct access to the LLM.

- Exposure by LLM-powered applications (E2): While an LLM alone may not drastically reduce the time it takes to arrange demonstrations or trial installations, additional software could be developed to streamline the process. For example, an application could integrate with the LLM to generate personalized demonstration scripts, provide insights on customer preferences based on data analysis, or automate follow-up communications. Such tools could enhance efficiency and effectiveness in managing equipment demonstrations.

- Exposure given image capabilities (E3): Image capabilities are not directly relevant to the task of arranging demonstrations or trial installations of equipment. This task primarily involves coordinating logistics and communication, which do not require image processing capabilities.

Based on the analysis, the task of arranging for demonstrations or trial installations of equipment aligns most closely with Exposure by LLM-powered applications (E2).
