1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of arranging childcare services for guests as a concierge, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. In this task, the concierge would typically need to communicate with guests, understand their childcare needs, coordinate with childcare providers, and ensure a smooth process. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM could assist in drafting emails to communicate with guests, coordinating schedules with childcare providers, and organizing information related to childcare services. It could also help in summarizing guest preferences and requirements for childcare.
- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time to complete this task, additional software could be developed to streamline the process. This software could potentially automate the coordination with childcare providers, suggest suitable options based on guest preferences, and maintain records of past childcare arrangements.
- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities would not significantly impact the task of arranging childcare services for guests, as it primarily involves text-based communication and coordination.

Based on the above analysis, the task of arranging childcare services for guests as a concierge would likely fall under E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications.
