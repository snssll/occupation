1: In this task of cleaning, refueling, and changing oil in line service aircraft, the main activities involve physical work such as cleaning the aircraft, refueling it, and changing its oil. These tasks require hands-on work and cannot be completed solely through text-based instructions or information provided by the LLM. The LLM does not have the capability to physically interact with the aircraft or perform tasks that require physical manipulation. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not benefit from the capabilities of the LLM or any tools built on top of it.
