1: For the task of organizing and supervising games or recreational activities as a short-term substitute teacher, the exposure to LLM can be analyzed as follows:

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM could potentially assist in generating ideas for games or recreational activities based on the age group of the students, their interests, and the available resources. It could also help in creating detailed instructions or guidelines for the activities. Additionally, the LLM could provide tips on how to effectively supervise and manage the activities to ensure a safe and engaging experience for the students.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While there may not be existing software specifically developed on top of the LLM to significantly reduce the time it takes to organize and supervise games or recreational activities, it is conceivable that such software could be created in the future. This software could potentially offer automated suggestions for activities, safety protocols, and behavior management strategies based on real-time data and feedback.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities would not significantly impact the task of organizing and supervising games or recreational activities, as it primarily involves text-based instructions, interactions, and supervision rather than visual content.

Based on the analysis, the task of organizing and supervising games or recreational activities as a short-term substitute teacher would likely fall under E1: Direct exposure.

2: E1

3: Moderate
