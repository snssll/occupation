1: In this task, a baker is required to observe the color of products being baked and make adjustments to oven temperatures, humidity, or conveyor speeds accordingly. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be aided by the LLM.

- E0: This task involves physical observation and adjustment of baking conditions based on visual cues. The task does not involve text-based inputs or outputs that can be directly processed by the LLM. The LLM does not have the capability to physically adjust oven settings or conveyor speeds.

- E1: While the LLM could potentially provide information on baking techniques, recipes, or troubleshooting tips through text-based inputs, it cannot directly observe the color of products being baked or adjust oven settings. The task is primarily hands-on and requires physical adjustments based on visual cues, which the LLM cannot perform.

- E2: It is conceivable that specialized software could be developed to assist bakers by analyzing images of baked products and providing recommendations for adjustments based on color. This software could potentially integrate image recognition capabilities with the LLM's text-based knowledge to offer guidance. However, such a system would require sophisticated image processing capabilities beyond the current scope of the LLM.

- E3: This task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images. The primary focus is on visual observation and manual adjustments in a physical baking environment, which does not align with the capabilities provided by image processing tools in conjunction with the LLM.
