1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of reviewing dockets of pending litigation to ensure adequate progress for Judicial Law Clerks, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it more efficiently.

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** If the task involves reviewing text-based documents such as legal dockets, the LLM could be used to summarize the information, highlight key points, or even provide suggestions based on legal precedents or guidelines. The LLM could help in quickly analyzing large amounts of text and identifying any discrepancies or areas that require attention, ultimately streamlining the review process.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time it takes to review dockets of pending litigation, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to enhance its capabilities for legal analysis. This software could potentially retrieve up-to-date legal information, provide recommendations based on legal precedents, or even assist in drafting legal documents based on the docket review.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Since the task primarily involves reviewing text-based documents like legal dockets, image capabilities would not significantly impact the completion of this task. Image capabilities are more relevant for tasks involving image analysis, creation, or editing, which are not central to reviewing legal documents.
