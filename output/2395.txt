1: In this task, the Marriage and Family Therapists are required to collect information about clients using various techniques such as testing, interviewing, discussion, or observation. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider how the LLM could assist in this task. The LLM could potentially help in generating interview questions based on general knowledge or providing guidance on effective interviewing techniques. It could also assist in summarizing information gathered during discussions or observations. However, the task involves interacting with clients, which requires a high degree of human interaction and empathy, aspects that the LLM may not be able to fully replicate. While the LLM could provide some support in terms of generating questions or summarizing information, the core aspect of building rapport and understanding clients' emotions and nuances may still heavily rely on human skills. Therefore, the task does not seem to fit neatly into any of the exposure labels, as the LLM's assistance would not significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced therapist to complete the task with high quality.
