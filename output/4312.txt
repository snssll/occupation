1: In this task, a Stocker and Order Filler is responsible for designing and setting up advertising signs and displays of merchandise to attract customers and promote sales. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality. 

- The task involves creativity and visual design skills, which may not be directly aided by the LLM.
- The LLM could potentially assist in generating written content for the signs or providing ideas for promotions.
- However, the physical aspect of setting up displays and the visual design elements may not be directly impacted by the LLM.
- While the LLM could provide some assistance in generating text content, the overall task still heavily relies on physical actions and visual design, which the LLM cannot directly perform.
