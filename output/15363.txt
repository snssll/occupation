1: In this task, a Semiconductor Processing Technician is responsible for scribing or separating wafers into dice. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone or with additional software could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality.

- E0: This task involves physical manipulation and precise actions that cannot be performed by the LLM or any software tool. The task requires hands-on work and specific technical skills that are beyond the capabilities of text-based models like the LLM.

- E1: The task of scribing or separating wafers into dice involves technical knowledge and skills that are not easily translatable into text-based instructions for the LLM. The physical nature of the task and the specialized expertise required make it unlikely that the LLM alone could reduce the time to complete this task by at least half with equivalent quality.

- E2: While it is conceivable that specialized software could be developed to assist Semiconductor Processing Technicians in automating certain aspects of wafer scribing or dice separation, the complexity and precision required for this task may still limit the extent to which the LLM alone could reduce the time to complete the task by half.

- E3: The task does not involve image processing or analysis that would significantly benefit from the combined capabilities of the LLM and image processing tools. The task is more focused on physical manipulation and technical expertise rather than visual or image-related aspects.
