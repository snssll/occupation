1: In this task, a First-Line Supervisor of Landscaping, Lawn Service, and Groundskeeping Workers is required to recommend changes in working conditions or equipment to increase crew efficiency. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we can break down the task as follows:

- The task involves analyzing the current working conditions and equipment used by the crew.
- It requires understanding the specific needs and challenges faced by the crew in their daily tasks.
- The supervisor needs to come up with recommendations that can improve efficiency based on their knowledge and experience in the field.

Given the nature of the task, it involves a level of domain-specific knowledge and expertise in landscaping, lawn service, and groundskeeping. While the LLM can provide general information and suggestions, it may not have the specialized knowledge required to make tailored recommendations for this specific task. Therefore, the task falls under E0 as it does not significantly benefit from the capabilities of the LLM alone.
