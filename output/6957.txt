1: In this task, the Online Merchants are responsible for fulfilling customer orders by packaging sold items and documentation for shipping or transferring orders to manufacturers or third-party distributors. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves straightforward instructions that can be easily understood and executed by an average worker. The task does not require specialized domain knowledge or complex decision-making. The main components involve packaging items, preparing documentation, and coordinating with manufacturers or distributors. These activities do not significantly benefit from the capabilities of a large language model (LLM) as they are more operational and manual in nature. While an LLM could potentially assist in generating documentation or communication with manufacturers/distributors, the core task of physically packaging items and coordinating shipments does not align with the capabilities of an LLM. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as the use of an LLM would not significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete the task with high quality.
