1: In this task, a cleaner of vehicles and equipment is required to monitor the operation of cleaning machines and stop them or notify supervisors when malfunctions occur. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves monitoring and responding to the operation of cleaning machines, which is primarily a manual and observational task. While the LLM could potentially provide information on troubleshooting common issues with cleaning machines, the task itself does not involve complex text transformation, data analysis, or decision-making that would significantly benefit from LLM capabilities. Therefore, the task does not align with the criteria for E1, E2, or E3 exposure labels. 

2: E0

3: High
