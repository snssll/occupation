1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of evaluating project plans and proposals to assess feasibility issues for Computer and Information Research Scientists, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be aided by the use of a large language model (LLM).

- Computer and Information Research Scientists typically need to analyze and assess complex technical information related to project plans and proposals. This task involves understanding the details of the plans, identifying potential challenges, and evaluating the feasibility of the proposed projects.
- An LLM can assist in this task by providing additional information, generating insights, and helping in the evaluation process by offering alternative perspectives or highlighting potential issues that may not be immediately apparent.
- The LLM can also help in summarizing key points from the project plans and proposals, generating questions for further clarification, and providing recommendations based on the information provided.
- While the task may benefit from the LLM's ability to process and analyze text data, it may not significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced Computer and Information Research Scientist to complete the task with high quality. The task still requires domain expertise and critical thinking skills that cannot be fully replaced by the LLM.

Based on these considerations, the task of evaluating project plans and proposals to assess feasibility issues for Computer and Information Research Scientists is best classified as E2 - Exposure by LLM-powered applications.
