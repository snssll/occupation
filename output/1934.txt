1: In this task, the Bridge and Lock Tenders are responsible for cleaning and lubricating equipment, as well as making minor repairs and adjustments. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality.

- The task involves physical actions such as cleaning, lubricating, and making minor repairs, which cannot be directly performed by the LLM.
- While the LLM can provide information on how to clean, lubricate, and make minor repairs, it cannot physically carry out these tasks.
- The task does not involve complex decision-making or specialized knowledge that would require the LLM's capabilities.
- Overall, the task does not align with the capabilities of the LLM in a way that would significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task.

Based on these considerations, the task of cleaning and lubricating equipment, and making minor repairs and adjustments for Bridge and Lock Tenders would be classified as E0 - No exposure.
