1: In this task, an Electrical Power-Line Installer and Repairer is required to cut and peel lead sheathing and insulation from cables and conduits. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if the task can be significantly expedited or improved by using the LLM. 

- The task involves physical actions such as cutting and peeling, which cannot be directly assisted by the LLM.
- The task is practical and hands-on, requiring manual dexterity and knowledge of electrical systems, which are not within the capabilities of the LLM.
- The task does not involve complex decision-making, analysis of large amounts of data, or require specialized domain knowledge that the LLM could provide.

Based on these considerations, it is clear that the task of cutting and peeling lead sheathing and insulation does not lend itself to automation or assistance by the LLM. Therefore, the appropriate label for this task is E0.

2: E0

3: High
