1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of interviewing and investigating applicants for public assistance as an Eligibility Interviewer for Government Programs, we need to consider the nature of the task and how LLM exposure could impact it:

- The task involves conducting interviews and gathering information from applicants, which requires strong interpersonal skills, critical thinking, and attention to detail.
- While the LLM could potentially assist in providing sample questions for interviews or generating written reports based on the gathered information, the core of the task involves human interaction and decision-making based on nuanced responses from applicants.
- The LLM may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task, as the key aspects of the job involve human judgment and empathy, which are not easily replicated by AI.

Based on these considerations, the task of interviewing and investigating applicants for public assistance as an Eligibility Interviewer for Government Programs is best classified as E0 - No exposure.
