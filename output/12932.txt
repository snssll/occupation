1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of presenting and explaining proposals, reports, or findings to clients as an Architectural and Engineering Manager, we need to consider the nature of the task and how LLM exposure could impact it:

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** The task involves communicating effectively with clients, which may require crafting persuasive and informative presentations. An LLM could assist in generating compelling content, refining language, and structuring the information in a coherent manner. The model could help in drafting scripts, creating slides, or even suggesting strategies for engaging with clients during the presentation.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While an LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task, additional software built on top of the LLM could enhance the process. For instance, an application that can analyze client preferences, industry trends, and past successful presentations to tailor the content for each client could streamline the preparation process.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Image capabilities would not have a direct impact on presenting proposals, reports, or findings to clients in this context. The task primarily involves verbal and written communication rather than visual content creation or analysis.
