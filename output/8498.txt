1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of investigating alleged license or permit violations as a Government Property Inspector and Investigator, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be completed with the help of an LLM.

- E1: Direct exposure - In this case, the task involves investigating alleged violations, which may require researching laws, regulations, and specific cases related to license or permit violations. An LLM can assist in providing information on relevant laws and regulations, analyzing case studies, and generating reports based on the findings. The LLM can help in summarizing information, drafting reports, and even suggesting potential next steps in the investigation process. Therefore, the task can be significantly expedited and enhanced with the direct use of an LLM.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the task may not be reduced by half with just the LLM alone, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to streamline the investigation process further. This software could include capabilities such as summarizing large volumes of legal documents, retrieving up-to-date information on specific cases, and providing recommendations based on the analysis conducted by the LLM. These additional tools could enhance the efficiency and accuracy of the investigation process.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not directly relevant to the task of investigating license or permit violations, as the task primarily involves legal research, analysis of documents, and report writing. Therefore, image capabilities would not significantly impact the completion time or quality of the task.

Based on the above analysis, the task of investigating alleged license or permit violations as a Government Property Inspector and Investigator is best classified as E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications.
