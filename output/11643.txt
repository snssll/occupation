1: In this task, the Automotive Service Technicians and Mechanics are required to perform routine and scheduled maintenance services like oil changes, lubrications, and tune-ups. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality. 

- E0: This task involves hands-on work that cannot be performed by the LLM or any software tool. The physical nature of the task, such as changing oil and performing tune-ups, requires manual labor and expertise that cannot be replaced by text-based AI models.
- E1: While the LLM could potentially provide information on best practices for maintenance services, it cannot physically perform the tasks like changing oil or tuning up a vehicle. The task involves practical skills and hands-on work that go beyond the capabilities of text-based AI models.
- E2: It is conceivable that software could be developed to assist technicians by providing detailed step-by-step guides or troubleshooting tips based on the LLM's knowledge. However, this software would not be able to physically carry out the maintenance services, making it challenging to significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task.
- E3: The task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images. Therefore, image capabilities would not significantly impact the completion time of this task.

2: E0
