1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of recommending or purchasing needed art supplies or equipment as an Art Therapist, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be completed with the help of an LLM.

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** An LLM could assist in generating a list of recommended art supplies based on specific criteria provided by the Art Therapist. The model could analyze the requirements, budget constraints, and preferences to suggest suitable supplies. Additionally, it could help in drafting emails to suppliers or creating purchase orders.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While an LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time it takes to recommend or purchase art supplies, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to streamline the process. This software could integrate with art supply databases, compare prices, check availability, and even automate the ordering process.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Image capabilities would not significantly impact the task of recommending or purchasing art supplies. This task is primarily text-based and does not involve detailed image analysis or creation.

Considering the above points, the task of recommending or purchasing art supplies as an Art Therapist aligns best with **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications)** as the potential for additional software development leveraging the LLM to enhance the efficiency of the process is evident.
