1: In this task, a motion picture projectionist is responsible for performing minor repairs on equipment like replacing worn sprockets or notifying maintenance personnel of the need for major repairs. To determine the appropriate label for exposure to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be significantly expedited or improved by using the language model. 

- E0: This task involves physical repairs and maintenance of equipment, which cannot be directly assisted by an LLM. The task requires hands-on work and technical expertise that cannot be substituted by text-based assistance.

- E1: While the LLM could potentially provide information on how to perform minor repairs or what signs indicate the need for major repairs, the actual repair work itself cannot be done through text-based instructions. The hands-on nature of the task limits the direct assistance the LLM can provide.

- E2: It is conceivable that software could be developed to assist motion picture projectionists by providing detailed repair manuals, troubleshooting guides, or maintenance schedules based on the information input by the projectionist. However, this software would need to integrate with physical equipment and real-time diagnostics, which goes beyond the capabilities of the LLM alone.

- E3: The task does not involve image processing or analysis that would benefit from additional image capabilities alongside the LLM. The repair work is focused on mechanical components rather than visual information.

2: E0
