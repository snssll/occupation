1: In this task, an electrician is required to inspect electrical systems, equipment, or components to identify hazards, defects, or the need for adjustment or repair, and to ensure compliance with codes. To determine the exposure level of this task to the LLM, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

Inspecting electrical systems involves physical examination and testing of equipment, which cannot be directly performed by an LLM. The task also requires practical knowledge of electrical systems, safety regulations, and hands-on skills to identify hazards and defects accurately. While the LLM can provide information on electrical codes and regulations, it cannot physically inspect equipment or systems.

Given these considerations, the task of inspecting electrical systems for hazards, defects, and compliance with codes falls under E0 as it involves physical inspection and practical skills that cannot be replaced by the LLM.
