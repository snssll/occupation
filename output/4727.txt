1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of developing alternative energy investment scenarios as an Industrial Ecologist, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves analyzing economic and environmental factors to create scenarios for comparison. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM can assist in writing and transforming text based on complex instructions, providing edits to existing text, and generating questions or responses. In this case, the LLM could help in drafting the scenarios based on input data and criteria provided by the Industrial Ecologist. However, the task also requires specialized knowledge in industrial ecology, which the LLM may not possess.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not reduce the time significantly for this task, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to analyze data, make recommendations, and provide insights based on specialized knowledge in industrial ecology. This software could enhance the efficiency of scenario development and comparison.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not directly relevant to this task, as it primarily involves analyzing economic and environmental data to develop scenarios. 

Considering the task's complexity and the need for specialized knowledge in industrial ecology, the most appropriate label seems to be E2.

2: E2

3: Moderate
