1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of providing information and advice regarding drug interactions, side effects, dosage, and proper medication storage as a pharmacist, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves a significant amount of text-based information processing, including understanding drug interactions, side effects, dosage guidelines, and storage recommendations. The LLM can assist in generating accurate and detailed information based on the input provided, such as specific drug names, interactions, and storage requirements. The model can also help in summarizing complex drug information and providing explanations in a clear and concise manner. Additionally, the LLM can aid in responding to questions related to medications and their usage.

Considering the nature of the task and the LLM's ability to process and generate text-based information effectively, this task falls under E1 - Direct exposure. The LLM can significantly reduce the time required to gather and present information on drug interactions, side effects, dosage, and medication storage with equivalent quality.
