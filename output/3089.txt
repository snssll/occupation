1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of conducting research as a Biological Technician, we need to consider how the task can be completed with the help of an LLM. 

- The task involves conducting research and collecting information and samples, which may require writing reports, analyzing data, and potentially communicating findings.
- An LLM could assist in writing reports based on the collected information, analyzing data to draw insights, and even generating questions or hypotheses based on the data.
- The LLM could also help in summarizing research articles or providing background information on specific topics related to the research being conducted.
- However, the task also involves physical aspects such as collecting samples, which cannot be directly assisted by an LLM.

Based on these considerations, the task of conducting research as a Biological Technician could be classified as E2. While the LLM can assist in various aspects of the research process, there are limitations in terms of physical sample collection that prevent it from being classified as E1.
