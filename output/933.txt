1: In this task, a Costume Attendant is responsible for arranging costumes in the order of use to facilitate quick-change procedures for performances. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be aided by the LLM.

- The task involves organizing costumes in a specific order, which is a manual and physical task that does not directly involve text input or output.
- While the LLM could potentially provide guidance on organizing costumes efficiently through written instructions, the task itself does not primarily involve text-based activities.
- The task does not require complex data analysis, specialized domain knowledge, or the use of images for completion.
- The LLM alone cannot significantly reduce the time it takes to physically arrange costumes in a specific order.

Based on these considerations, the task of arranging costumes in order of use for quick-change procedures is not directly impacted by the capabilities of the LLM. Therefore, it falls under label E0 - No exposure.
