1: In this task, an Ophthalmic Medical Technologist is required to measure corneal thickness using specific tools like a pachymeter or contact ultrasound methods. The task involves precise measurements and specialized knowledge related to ophthalmic procedures. While the LLM can provide general information about corneal thickness measurement techniques, it cannot physically perform the measurements or handle the equipment required for this task. Therefore, the task does not fall under E1, E2, or E3 exposure categories as the LLM alone cannot significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with high quality.
