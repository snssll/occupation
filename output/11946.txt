1: In this task, a Career/Technical Education Teacher at the secondary school level is responsible for planning and supervising work-experience programs in various settings. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- Direct exposure (E1): The task involves planning and supervising work-experience programs, which may require writing detailed instructions, coordinating with businesses, and ensuring the program meets educational objectives. An LLM could assist in drafting program guidelines, crafting communication with businesses, and providing suggestions for optimizing the learning experience for students. The LLM could also help in summarizing feedback from previous programs to improve future iterations. Therefore, the LLM could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality.

- Exposure by LLM-powered applications (E2): While the LLM alone can assist in various aspects of planning and supervising work-experience programs, additional software could be developed to streamline the process further. This software could potentially analyze feedback data from multiple programs to provide insights for program improvement, recommend industry-specific best practices, or even automate certain administrative tasks related to work-experience programs. 

- Exposure given image capabilities (E3): Image capabilities would not significantly impact the completion of this task as it primarily involves planning and supervision rather than image-related activities.
