1: In this task, a Print Binding and Finishing Worker is responsible for compressing sewed or glued signatures using hand presses or smashing machines. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. This task involves physical manipulation of materials and machinery, which cannot be directly performed by an LLM. The LLM does not have the capability to physically compress materials or operate machinery. Therefore, this task falls under the category of tasks that require physical interaction and cannot be automated by the LLM. As a result, the task is best classified as E0.
