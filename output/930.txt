1: In this task, the Door-to-Door Sales Worker is responsible for arranging buying parties and soliciting sponsorship to sell merchandise. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if access to the LLM or LLM-powered tools can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality.

Door-to-Door sales involve a high degree of human interaction and physical presence, which cannot be replaced by the LLM. The task also requires personal persuasion, negotiation, and sales skills that are best performed by a human. While the LLM could potentially assist in drafting sponsorship proposals or providing general sales advice, the core activities of arranging buying parties and soliciting sponsorship heavily rely on human interaction and networking.
