1: In this task, a Mechanical Engineer is required to select or install combined heat units, power units, cogeneration equipment, or trigeneration equipment that reduces energy use or pollution. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves technical knowledge and expertise in mechanical engineering.
- The task requires understanding energy efficiency, pollution reduction, and the selection/installation of specific equipment.
- The task does not involve direct text-based interactions or information processing that can be easily automated by an LLM.
- The task does not involve accessing up-to-date facts or specialized domain knowledge that the LLM can provide.

Based on these considerations, the task does not align with the capabilities of the LLM in a way that would significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced Mechanical Engineer to complete it. Therefore, this task would be classified as E0.

2: E0

3: High
