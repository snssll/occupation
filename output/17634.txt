1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of verifying that prepared food meets requirements for quality and quantity as a Fast Food Cook, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be aided by the use of a large language model (LLM).

- E1: Direct exposure - In this case, the task involves a straightforward verification process that can be guided by specific criteria for quality and quantity. The LLM can assist in providing guidelines, checklists, or even sample responses for verifying food quality and quantity. The LLM can help in generating standardized forms or templates for recording the verification results. Overall, the LLM can significantly reduce the time needed to complete this task with equivalent quality by providing structured guidance and support.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the task itself is relatively simple and can be aided by the LLM directly, there may not be a need for additional software beyond the LLM to complete the task efficiently. The LLM alone can provide the necessary support for verifying food quality and quantity in a fast-food setting.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not relevant for this task as it primarily involves verifying food quality and quantity, which can be described and assessed through text-based instructions and criteria. There is no need for image processing or analysis in this context.

Based on the above analysis, the task of verifying that prepared food meets requirements for quality and quantity as a Fast Food Cook is best classified as **E1: Direct exposure**.
