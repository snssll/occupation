1: In this task, the occupation of Etchers and Engravers involves removing wax or tape from etched glassware. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality. The task involves manual dexterity and physical manipulation of objects, which cannot be directly assisted by the LLM. The LLM does not have the capability to physically interact with objects like glassware. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not meet the criteria for exposure to LLM.

2: E0

3: High
