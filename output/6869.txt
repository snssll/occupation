1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of fabricating new or modifying existing prototype components or fixtures as an Automotive Engineering Technician, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be aided by the use of a large language model (LLM).

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** If the task involves writing detailed instructions for fabricating components or fixtures, the LLM could assist in generating these instructions based on the provided specifications. The LLM could also help in transforming text instructions into detailed steps for fabrication. Additionally, if there are complex requirements or specifications that need to be translated into actionable steps, the LLM could provide support in this process.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time it takes to fabricate components or fixtures, additional software built on top of the LLM could enhance the process. For example, an application that can generate 3D models based on text descriptions provided to the LLM could streamline the fabrication process by providing visual references for the components or fixtures.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** If the task involves creating or editing digital images of the components or fixtures, the LLM's image capabilities could be beneficial. The LLM could assist in generating visual representations of the prototypes based on text descriptions, which could aid in the fabrication process.
