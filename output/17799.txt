1: In this task, the occupation of "Gambling Dealers" involves working as part of a team of dealers in games like baccarat or craps. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality by at least half.

- E0: This task involves physical interaction and real-time decision-making in a casino setting, which cannot be replaced by the LLM. The LLM cannot physically deal cards or interact with players in a live gambling environment.

- E1: The LLM could potentially provide information on rules, strategies, or general knowledge related to baccarat or craps, which might be useful for training purposes. However, the direct use of the LLM would not significantly reduce the time it takes to work as a gambling dealer in a team setting.

- E2: While it's conceivable that software could be developed on top of the LLM to simulate virtual gambling scenarios for training purposes, this would not directly impact the real-world task of working as a gambling dealer in a team.

- E3: The task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images, so the image capabilities of the LLM are not relevant here.

2: E0

3: Certainty: High
