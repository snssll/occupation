1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of providing assistance to physicians or other technologists in the performance of more complex procedures as a Radiologic Technologist or Technician, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be impacted by the use of the LLM.

- Radiologic Technologists and Technicians require specialized knowledge and training to assist in medical procedures involving imaging technologies. The task of providing assistance in more complex procedures involves understanding medical terminology, equipment operation, patient care, and following specific protocols.

- While the LLM can provide information and guidance on medical procedures and terminology, it lacks the hands-on skills and physical presence required to directly assist in performing complex medical procedures.

- The task involves real-time interaction, physical coordination, and the ability to adapt to changing situations, which are beyond the capabilities of the LLM.

- The LLM cannot physically assist in medical procedures or provide real-time support in a medical setting, making it unsuitable for tasks that require direct human interaction and physical presence.
