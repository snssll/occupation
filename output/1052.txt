1: In this task, the Cargo and Freight Agent is responsible for assembling containers and crates used for transporting items like machines or vehicles. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. Assembling containers and crates involves physical work and manual labor, which cannot be directly assisted by the LLM. The task requires hands-on skills, knowledge of materials, and physical coordination, none of which can be substituted by the LLM. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not involve text-based work that can be significantly aided by the LLM.
