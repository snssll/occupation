1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of choosing subject matter and suitable form to express personal feelings, experiences, ideas, or to narrate stories or events as a Poet, Lyricist, or Creative Writer, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves a high level of creativity, personal expression, and decision-making based on individual experiences and emotions. While the LLM can assist with generating text, providing suggestions, and even helping with creative writing prompts, the core aspect of selecting subject matter and form based on personal feelings and experiences is highly subjective and requires human creativity and emotional intelligence.
