1: In this task, the occupation of Etchers and Engravers involves using sandblasting equipment to cut designs into glass surfaces. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone or with additional software could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality. 

- E1: Direct access to the LLM could potentially help in providing information on different sandblasting techniques, safety precautions, or design ideas related to glass etching. The LLM could assist in generating text-based instructions or explanations for specific queries related to sandblasting.
- E2: While the LLM alone may not directly reduce the time to complete the physical task of sandblasting glass, additional software built on top of the LLM could potentially aid in creating digital designs for etching, providing detailed instructions, or even simulating the etching process virtually.
- E3: Image capabilities could be beneficial in this task if the system could generate digital images of proposed designs on glass surfaces based on input descriptions. However, since the task involves physical sandblasting, the image capabilities alone may not significantly reduce the time required to complete the task.

Based on the considerations above, the task of sandblasting exposed areas of glass to cut designs would likely fall under E2 as having access to additional software built on top of the LLM could potentially enhance the design process and provide valuable assistance, even though the LLM itself may not directly reduce the physical sandblasting time.
