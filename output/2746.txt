1: For the task of computing and verifying totals on report forms, requisitions, or bills using an adding machine or calculator, the most relevant exposure label from the rubric would be E1. This task involves working with text-based information (report forms, requisitions, bills) and performing calculations, which can be easily handled by the LLM. The LLM can assist in computing totals, verifying accuracy, and potentially even generating reports based on the input data. The task does not require specialized domain knowledge or image capabilities, making it suitable for direct exposure to the LLM.
