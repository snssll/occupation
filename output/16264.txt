1: In this task, a Food Preparation Worker is responsible for stocking cupboards and refrigerators, as well as tending to salad bars and buffet meals. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes for an average worker to complete this task with equivalent quality. 

- The task involves physical actions such as stocking cupboards and refrigerators, which cannot be directly assisted by the LLM.
- Tending to salad bars and buffet meals may involve some decision-making based on visual cues and interactions with customers, which are not within the capabilities of the LLM.
- While the LLM could potentially provide written instructions or guidelines for food preparation, it cannot physically stock items or interact with food in a practical setting.

Based on these considerations, it is evident that the task of stocking cupboards and refrigerators, and tending salad bars and buffet meals falls under the E0 category as it involves physical actions and human interactions that cannot be directly assisted by the LLM.
