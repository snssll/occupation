1: In this task, the occupation involves designing furniture using computer-aided drawing programs. With the help of a large language model (LLM), a worker could potentially receive assistance in generating design ideas, drafting descriptions or specifications for the furniture, and even obtaining information on different styles or materials to use. The LLM could also help in providing feedback on the design, suggesting improvements, or even generating code for the computer-aided drawing programs. However, since the task specifically mentions using computer-aided drawing programs, which involve technical skills and precise measurements, the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with high quality. While the LLM could assist in some aspects of the task, the core requirement of using the drawing programs would still heavily rely on the worker's technical expertise.
