1: In this task, a Tool and Die Maker is required to set up and operate drill presses to drill and tap holes in parts for assembly. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves physical manipulation of machinery and tools, specifically drill presses, to perform drilling and tapping operations. This task does not involve text input or output, complex instructions, document analysis, or any other form of information processing that could be significantly aided by an LLM. As such, the task does not align with the capabilities of the LLM or any tools built on top of it. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not benefit from LLM exposure.

2: E0
