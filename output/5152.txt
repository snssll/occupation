1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of developing regulatory strategies and implementation plans for new products as a Regulatory Affairs Manager, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be aided by the use of a large language model (LLM) like OpenAI's model.

- Regulatory strategies and implementation plans involve a significant amount of text-based work, including researching regulations, drafting plans, and ensuring compliance with legal requirements. An LLM can assist in generating text, providing insights on regulatory requirements, and helping to structure the plans effectively.

- The task does not involve precise measurements, detailed visuals, or physical interactions, making it suitable for text-based assistance from an LLM.

- While the task may require some level of expertise and domain knowledge, the LLM can still provide valuable support in generating, organizing, and refining the regulatory strategies and plans.

Considering these points, the task of developing regulatory strategies and implementation plans for new products as a Regulatory Affairs Manager could be classified as E1 - Direct exposure. The LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task by assisting in writing, transforming text, providing insights, and structuring plans effectively.
