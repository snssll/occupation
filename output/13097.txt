1: In this task, a motion picture projectionist is responsible for projecting motion pictures onto back screens for inclusion in scenes within film or stage productions. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves operating projection equipment to display specific content, which does not directly involve text-based input or output. The task also does not require complex data analysis, specialized domain knowledge, or image processing capabilities beyond what the LLM can provide. Therefore, this task does not align with any of the exposure levels outlined in the rubric.

2: E0
