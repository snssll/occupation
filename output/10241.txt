1: In this task, a construction laborer is responsible for mopping, brushing, or spreading paints, cleaning solutions, or other compounds over surfaces to clean or provide protection. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be impacted by the use of an LLM. 

- E0: This task involves physical labor that cannot be automated or significantly assisted by an LLM. The core activity of mopping, brushing, or spreading paints requires manual dexterity and physical presence, which cannot be replaced by text-based AI models.

- E1: While an LLM could potentially provide information on the best practices for cleaning or painting surfaces, the actual execution of the task still heavily relies on manual labor. The LLM may offer guidance or instructions on the types of paints or cleaning solutions to use, but it cannot directly perform the physical actions required for this task.

- E2: It is challenging to imagine additional software that could be developed on top of an LLM to significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task. The task is straightforward and does not involve complex decision-making or specialized knowledge that would benefit from advanced AI capabilities.

- E3: Image capabilities would not be relevant for this task as it does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images.
