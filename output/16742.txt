1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of taking readings and recording data as a Hydroelectric Plant Technician, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be impacted by the use of the LLM.

- The task involves a straightforward data collection process that requires accuracy and attention to detail.
- The LLM could potentially assist in providing guidelines or best practices for data collection and recording.
- The LLM could also help in generating reports or summaries based on the collected data.
- However, the task does not involve complex decision-making or specialized domain knowledge that would significantly benefit from the LLM's capabilities beyond basic text generation.

Based on these considerations, the task of taking readings and recording data as a Hydroelectric Plant Technician would likely fall under E1. The LLM can assist in providing guidance and generating reports, but the task itself does not require specialized domain knowledge or complex data analysis that would warrant a higher exposure label.

2: E1

3: Moderate
