1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of conducting assessments of patients' risk for harm to self or others as a Clinical and Counseling Psychologist, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it.

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** The task involves analyzing and evaluating complex information related to patients' mental health and potential risks. The LLM could assist in providing information on risk assessment tools, guidelines, and best practices in conducting such assessments. It could also help in generating standardized assessment questions or templates based on the patient's responses. Additionally, the LLM could aid in summarizing relevant research studies or case studies that could inform the assessment process.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time it takes to conduct the assessments, additional software built on top of the LLM could enhance the process. For example, a specialized application could be developed that integrates the LLM's capabilities with real-time data analysis of patient responses during assessments to provide immediate risk level indications or recommendations. This application could also incorporate the latest research findings and guidelines to ensure the assessments are up-to-date and comprehensive.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Image capabilities would not significantly impact the task of conducting risk assessments in this context. The task primarily involves analyzing verbal information and patient interactions rather than visual data.
