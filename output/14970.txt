1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of reviewing annual reports of counties, conservation districts, or watershed management organizations as a Conservation Scientist, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it could be impacted by the use of an LLM.

- The task involves reviewing text-based documents (annual reports) to certify compliance with reporting requirements. This task primarily requires reading and analyzing written information.
- An LLM could potentially assist in summarizing the key points of the reports, identifying any discrepancies or areas of concern, and even generating a certification report based on the analysis.
- The LLM could also help in cross-referencing information within the reports or providing additional context based on general knowledge.

Considering these points, the task could benefit from the use of an LLM to expedite the review process, provide insights, and potentially automate parts of the certification process. Therefore, this task falls under label E1 - Direct exposure.
