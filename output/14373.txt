1: In this task, the Outdoor Power Equipment and Other Small Engine Mechanics are required to remove engines from equipment and bolt them to repair stands. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. This task involves physical actions such as removing engines and bolting them to repair stands, which cannot be directly performed by an LLM. The task does not involve text input or output that can be processed by the LLM. As a result, there is no way for the LLM to significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not benefit from the capabilities of the LLM.

2: E0
