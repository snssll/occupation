1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of recommending improvements to existing or planned logistics processes as a Logistics Analyst, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM can assist in completing it. 

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** The task involves analyzing current logistics processes and suggesting improvements, which can be done by providing text input to the LLM and receiving text output with recommendations. The LLM can assist in generating ideas, identifying inefficiencies, and proposing solutions based on the input data provided. This task aligns well with the capabilities of the LLM in processing text and providing insights based on the information given.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the LLM can help generate recommendations and insights, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to streamline the process further. This software could potentially automate the analysis of large datasets, integrate real-time data for decision-making, or provide more specialized recommendations based on industry-specific knowledge. 

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Image capabilities are not relevant for this task as it primarily involves text-based analysis and recommendations related to logistics processes.

Considering the above points, the task of recommending improvements to existing or planned logistics processes aligns best with **E1 (Direct exposure)** as the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to generate recommendations and insights for this type of task.
