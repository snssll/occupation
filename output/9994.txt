1: In this task of monitoring equipment functioning and performing regular unit checks, the primary focus is on observing and ensuring the proper operation of equipment in a gas plant. This task does not involve writing, transforming text, summarizing documents, or any other text-related activities that could benefit significantly from the use of an LLM. The task also does not involve image processing or analysis that could leverage the capabilities of an LLM with image capabilities. Additionally, this task requires physical presence and interaction with equipment, which cannot be replaced by the LLM. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not align with any of the exposure levels described in the rubric.
