1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of generating financial ratios as a Credit Analyst using computer programs, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. In this task, the LLM could potentially assist in generating financial ratios by providing guidance on the specific ratios to calculate, explaining the significance of each ratio, and potentially even automating the calculation process based on the input data. The LLM could also help in interpreting the results and providing insights based on the calculated ratios. However, since this task involves specific financial knowledge and calculations, the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task by at least half. It is conceivable that additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to streamline the process further by integrating with financial databases, automating data retrieval, and offering more advanced analysis capabilities. Therefore, this task falls under label E2 - Exposure by LLM-powered applications.
