1: In this task, the Educational, Guidance, and Career Counselor needs to address community groups, faculty, and staff members to explain available counseling services. To complete this task, the counselor would need to effectively communicate the information about the counseling services, tailor the message to the specific audience, and potentially answer questions or provide further details. The LLM could assist in generating a script for the counselor to use, providing suggestions on how to effectively communicate the information, and even offering potential responses to common questions. The LLM could also help in summarizing key points or creating presentation materials. Overall, the LLM could significantly reduce the time it takes to prepare for and deliver this explanation of available counseling services.
