1: In this task, a Diagnostic Medical Sonographer is responsible for preparing patients for ultrasound exams. The task involves explaining the procedure to the patient, transferring them to the ultrasound table, scrubbing the skin, applying gel, and ensuring the patient is positioned correctly. This task primarily involves physical actions and interactions with the patient, which cannot be performed by an LLM or any software tool. The task does not involve text input or output, and the expertise required lies in patient care and technical skills related to ultrasound imaging, rather than information processing or analysis. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it cannot be significantly aided by the capabilities of an LLM.
