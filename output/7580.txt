1: To determine the appropriate exposure label for the task of implementing appropriate follow-up care plans as a Radiation Therapist, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be aided by the use of the LLM.

- **E0**: This task involves implementing follow-up care plans, which likely requires a high degree of human interaction and specialized medical knowledge. The task may involve assessing patient conditions, understanding treatment outcomes, and making decisions based on individual patient needs. The LLM, even though powerful, may not have the specific medical expertise and patient data required to create tailored follow-up care plans.

- **E1**: While the LLM can provide general information on follow-up care plans based on existing medical knowledge, it may not have access to real-time patient data or the ability to make personalized recommendations without up-to-date patient information. The task may involve nuances and specific patient conditions that require human expertise and interaction.

- **E2**: It is conceivable that specialized software could be developed on top of the LLM to assist Radiation Therapists in creating follow-up care plans. This software could potentially analyze patient data, treatment outcomes, and medical guidelines to provide recommendations for follow-up care. However, the complexity of medical decision-making and the need for personalized care plans may still require human input and expertise.

- **E3**: Given the task does not involve image processing or detailed visual analysis, the inclusion of image capabilities would not significantly impact the completion of the task of implementing follow-up care plans as a Radiation Therapist.
