This task involves ensuring scientific rigor, accuracy, and clarity of presentation in the documents. With the help of a large language model (LLM), the specialist could potentially use the model to assist in reviewing the data and reports, checking for accuracy, and improving the clarity of the presentation. The LLM could help in identifying inconsistencies, suggesting improvements in wording, and ensuring that the information is presented accurately.
