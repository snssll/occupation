1: In this task, a Speech-Language Pathologist is required to consult with clients and refer them to additional medical or educational services as needed. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we can break down the task as follows:

- Consulting with clients: The LLM can assist in providing information, guidance, and recommendations based on the input provided about the client's needs and circumstances. This involves writing and transforming text based on complex instructions, which falls under E1 exposure.
- Referring clients to additional services: The LLM can help generate potential referrals based on the information provided about the client's requirements and available services. This involves providing recommendations based on data, which could be considered as E2 exposure.
- Overall, the task involves a combination of providing information, guidance, and recommendations based on client interactions, which can be significantly aided by the LLM's capabilities.
