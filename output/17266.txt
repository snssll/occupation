1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of transplanting trees, vegetables, or horticultural plants as an Agricultural Technician, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves physical work that cannot be directly performed by the LLM, as it requires hands-on activities such as digging, lifting, and replanting. The LLM cannot physically interact with the plants or soil to transplant them. While the LLM could potentially provide information on the best practices for transplanting specific types of plants, it cannot actually carry out the task itself. Therefore, the task falls under E0 as it does not involve text-based activities that the LLM can directly assist with.

2: E0
