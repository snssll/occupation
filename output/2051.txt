1: In this task, a Helper in Installation, Maintenance, and Repair Workers is responsible for cleaning or lubricating various items using hand tools, power tools, and cleaning equipment. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be completed more efficiently with the help of the language model. Since this task involves physical actions like cleaning and lubricating, it does not directly involve text-based activities that the LLM excels at. The task does not require complex text transformation, writing, summarization, or data analysis that the LLM could significantly assist with. Therefore, the task does not align with any of the exposure levels related to text-based tasks.
