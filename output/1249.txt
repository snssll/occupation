1: In this task, a Food Preparation Worker is required to assist cooks and kitchen staff with various tasks as needed and provide cooks with needed items. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be significantly expedited or improved by using the language model. 

- Food Preparation Workers typically involve physical tasks in a kitchen setting, such as chopping vegetables, preparing ingredients, and organizing the kitchen. These tasks are hands-on and require physical presence, which cannot be replaced by an LLM.
- While the LLM could potentially provide information on recipes, ingredient substitutions, or cooking techniques, the primary role of a Food Preparation Worker is to assist in the physical preparation of food, which is not text-based.
- The task does not involve complex decision-making, specialized domain knowledge, or detailed document analysis that would greatly benefit from LLM capabilities.

Based on these considerations, the task of assisting cooks and kitchen staff as a Food Preparation Worker is best classified as E0 - No exposure to LLM.
