1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of assisting drafters in developing the structural design of products as a Mechanical Engineer, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can benefit from the use of a large language model (LLM).

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** If the task involves writing and transforming text or code related to drafting tools, providing edits to existing designs, or generating design-related questions, the LLM could significantly reduce the time needed to complete these tasks with equivalent quality. The LLM could assist in creating detailed design specifications, drafting tool instructions, or even generating design-related questions for assessments.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the task may not be directly reducible to text input and output, additional software built on top of the LLM could potentially aid in summarizing complex design documents, retrieving up-to-date information on structural design principles, or providing recommendations based on design data. This software could enhance the efficiency of the design process by leveraging the LLM's capabilities.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Since the task involves assisting in developing the structural design of products, which may include working with technical drawings or sketches, having image capabilities could be beneficial. The LLM, in combination with image processing tools, could help in reading text from technical drawings, scanning images for design elements, or creating/editing digital images related to the structural design process.
