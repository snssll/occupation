1: In this task, a Teaching Assistant is required to prepare various educational materials such as lesson materials, bulletin board displays, exhibits, equipment, and demonstrations. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- E0: This task involves physical preparation of materials like bulletin board displays and equipment, which cannot be directly assisted by the LLM or any software tools. The task also requires creativity and physical interaction with the materials, making it unsuitable for automation.

- E1: While the LLM can assist in generating text-based lesson materials or descriptions for exhibits and demonstrations, it cannot physically prepare bulletin board displays or equipment. The creativity and physical aspect of this task are crucial, which limits the direct assistance the LLM can provide.

- E2: It is conceivable that additional software could be developed to assist in generating lesson materials or descriptions based on specific inputs provided by the Teaching Assistant. However, the physical preparation of materials like bulletin board displays and equipment would still require human intervention.

- E3: The task does not involve image processing or detailed visual instructions that would benefit significantly from image capabilities. The primary focus is on preparing educational materials, which does not align with the capabilities provided by image processing tools.
