1: In this task, an embalmer is responsible for arranging funeral home equipment and performing general maintenance. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone or with additional software could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality.

- E0: This task involves physical actions such as arranging equipment and performing maintenance, which cannot be directly assisted by the LLM or any software tools built on top of it. The task also does not involve complex decision-making that could be automated by the LLM.

- E1: While the LLM could potentially provide information on best practices for arranging funeral home equipment or general maintenance tips, the actual physical tasks of arranging equipment and performing maintenance cannot be directly completed by the LLM. Therefore, the time savings with equivalent quality would not be significant enough to warrant an E1 label.

- E2: It is conceivable that software could be developed on top of the LLM to provide recommendations on equipment arrangement or maintenance procedures based on general knowledge or best practices. However, the physical aspect of the task still requires human intervention, and the time savings may not be substantial enough to warrant an E2 label.

- E3: The task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images, so the image capabilities of the LLM would not significantly impact the completion time of this task.
