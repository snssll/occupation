1: In this task, the First-Line Supervisors of Correctional Officers are required to instruct employees or provide on-the-job training. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality. 

- E0: This task involves direct human interaction and hands-on training, which cannot be replaced by the LLM. The LLM cannot physically provide on-the-job training or interact with employees in a practical setting.
- E1: While the LLM can provide written instructions or guidelines for training materials, it cannot directly provide on-the-job training or interact with employees in a practical setting. The task involves hands-on training and direct human interaction, which the LLM cannot replicate.
- E2: It is conceivable that additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to assist in creating training materials or guidelines for on-the-job training. However, the core aspect of providing hands-on training and direct interaction with employees would still require human involvement.
- E3: The task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images, so the image capabilities of the LLM are not relevant here.

Based on the above analysis, the most appropriate label for this task is E2.

2: E2

3: Moderate
