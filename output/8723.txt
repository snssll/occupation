1: In this task, a graphic designer is required to key information into computer equipment to create layouts for clients or supervisors. This task involves inputting text and potentially other design elements into design software to create visual compositions. With the help of a large language model (LLM), the designer could potentially receive assistance in generating text content, refining the layout, or even suggesting design elements based on the input provided. The LLM could help in generating text content, providing suggestions for layout structures, or even offering creative ideas for the design. However, the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task, as graphic design involves a visual aspect that the LLM may not directly address.
