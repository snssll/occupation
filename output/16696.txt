1: In this task, an Ophthalmic Medical Technician is required to take anatomical or functional ocular measurements of the eye or surrounding tissue, such as axial length measurements. This task involves precise measurements of the eye, which cannot be done solely through text input and output. The task requires physical interaction with the patient, as well as the use of specialized equipment to accurately measure the eye. Since the task involves hands-on work and precise measurements, it cannot be effectively completed using the LLM or any software built on top of it. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not benefit from the capabilities of the LLM.
