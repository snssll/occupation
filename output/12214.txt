1: For the task of positioning, joining, aligning, or sealing structural components in construction, the exposure to LLM can be analyzed as follows:

- E0: This task involves physical labor and precise measurements, which cannot be effectively replaced by an LLM or any tool built on top of it. The task requires hands-on work and cannot be completed solely through text-based instructions or information.

- E1: While an LLM could potentially provide written instructions or guidance on how to position, join, align, or seal structural components, the actual physical work involved in construction cannot be replaced by the LLM. The model may be able to offer some theoretical knowledge or suggestions, but the execution of the task still heavily relies on manual labor and expertise.

- E2: It is challenging to imagine additional software built on top of an LLM that could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task. The nature of construction work involves physical actions and real-world interactions that go beyond the capabilities of text-based AI models.

- E3: The task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images. Therefore, the exposure to LLM with image capabilities does not significantly impact the completion of this task.
