1: In this task, a stonemason is required to line interiors of molds with treated paper and fill molds with a composition-stone mixture. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves physical actions such as lining molds and filling them with a mixture, which cannot be directly performed by an LLM. The task does not involve text input or output, and the expertise required is in physical craftsmanship rather than information processing. Therefore, the task does not align with the capabilities of the LLM, and no exposure to LLM capabilities would significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task.
