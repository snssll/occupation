1: In this task, the occupation of embalmers involves a specific action of joining lips using needles and thread or wire. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality. Since this task involves a physical, hands-on procedure that requires manual dexterity and precision, it cannot be directly completed using the LLM. The LLM does not have the capability to perform physical tasks or interact with physical objects. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not meet the criteria for exposure to LLM capabilities.

2: E0

3: High
