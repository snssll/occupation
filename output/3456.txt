1: In this task, a proofreader or copy marker is required to consult reference books or seek help from readers to verify references according to grammar and composition rules. With the help of a large language model (LLM), the proofreader could potentially streamline the process of checking references by quickly accessing grammar and composition rules, verifying citations, and ensuring the accuracy of the content. The LLM could assist in providing suggestions for corrections, identifying grammatical errors, and offering alternative phrasing options. Overall, the LLM could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task by providing quick access to relevant information and aiding in the proofreading process.

Considering the task involves text input and output related to grammar and composition rules, the LLM can directly assist in completing the task efficiently. The LLM can provide edits, suggestions, and references to aid in the proofreading process, ultimately reducing the time required for manual verification and corrections. Therefore, this task aligns with the E1 label as direct access to the LLM can significantly expedite the proofreading and reference checking process.
