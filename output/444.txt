1: In this task, an Operating Engineer is required to align machines, cutterheads, or depth gauge makers with reference stakes and guidelines based on hand signals from other workers. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. This task involves a significant amount of physical coordination and interaction with other workers on a construction site. The task does not primarily involve written or text-based activities that could be easily automated by an LLM. The LLM does not have the capability to physically align equipment or interpret hand signals in a real-world setting. Therefore, the task does not align with any of the exposure levels in the rubric.
