1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of advising political science students, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be supported by the capabilities of the LLM. 

- E0: This task involves providing personalized advice and guidance to political science students, which requires a high degree of human interaction and understanding of individual needs and circumstances. The LLM, even in its most powerful form, cannot replicate the nuanced understanding and empathy needed for effective advising in this context. Additionally, the task may involve discussing complex and sensitive topics that require human judgment and emotional intelligence, which the LLM lacks.

- E1: While the LLM can provide general information and insights related to political science, it cannot engage in interactive conversations or tailor advice to individual students' needs. The task of advising involves a dynamic exchange of ideas, feedback, and support, which goes beyond the capabilities of the LLM to provide in a meaningful way. Therefore, the direct use of the LLM would not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality.

- E2: It is conceivable that additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to assist political scientists in gathering relevant information, analyzing data, or generating insights that could inform their advice to students. This software could potentially streamline the research process or provide recommendations based on the LLM's capabilities. However, the core task of advising political science students would still require human judgment, empathy, and interaction, which the LLM alone cannot fully replicate.

- E3: The task of advising political science students does not involve image processing or visual content that would benefit from additional image capabilities. Therefore, the use of image capabilities in conjunction with the LLM would not significantly impact the completion of this task.
