1: In this task, a Glass Blower, Molder, Bender, or Finisher is required to place electrodes in tube ends and heat them with glass burners to fuse them into place. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. This task involves physical manipulation of materials (electrodes and glass) and requires hands-on skills to fuse them together using glass burners. The task does not involve text input or output, complex instructions, data analysis, or any form of written communication that could be significantly aided by an LLM. Therefore, this task does not align with any of the exposure levels in the rubric.
