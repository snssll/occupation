1: In this task, a Costume Attendant collaborates with production designers, costume designers, or other production staff to discuss and execute costume design details. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be significantly expedited or improved by using the language model. 

- E1: Direct access to the LLM could potentially help in generating ideas for costume designs, providing historical context for specific styles, or suggesting materials based on descriptions. The LLM could assist in drafting emails or reports related to costume design discussions.
- E2: While an application could be developed to summarize costume design trends, provide recommendations based on historical data, or analyze feedback from previous costume designs, the task itself does not inherently require specialized domain knowledge or complex data analysis that would greatly benefit from LLM-powered applications.
- E3: Image capabilities are not relevant for this task as it primarily involves text-based communication and collaboration on costume design details.

Based on the analysis, the task aligns most closely with E1 as the LLM can assist in generating text-based content related to costume design discussions and executions.
