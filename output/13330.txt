1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of providing geographical information systems support to the private and public sectors as a Geographer, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can benefit from the use of a large language model (LLM) like OpenAI's model.

- Geographical information systems support involves working with spatial data, maps, and analysis tools to provide insights and solutions related to geographic information. This task may involve tasks such as data analysis, mapping, and creating visualizations based on geographic data.
- An LLM could potentially assist in tasks such as summarizing reports related to geographical information systems, generating written documentation or reports based on analyzed data, answering questions related to geographic data, or even providing recommendations based on the analysis conducted.
- While the LLM may not directly reduce the time it takes to complete the task by half, it is easy to imagine additional software that could be developed on top of the LLM to enhance its capabilities for tasks specific to geographical information systems support. This software could potentially include features like summarizing complex geographic data, retrieving up-to-date information related to geographic trends, or even providing specialized recommendations based on the analysis of spatial data.

Based on these considerations, the task of providing geographical information systems support to the private and public sectors as a Geographer falls under the label E2 - Exposure by LLM-powered applications.
