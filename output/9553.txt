1: In this task, a welder, cutter, solderer, or brazer is required to mark or tag materials with job numbers, piece marks, and other identifying marks as needed. This task involves physical interaction with materials and requires precision in marking the materials accurately. The task does not involve complex decision-making or analysis that an LLM could significantly assist with. As such, there is no clear way for the LLM to reduce the time it takes to complete this task with high quality by at least half. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not benefit from exposure to the LLM.

2: E0

3: High
