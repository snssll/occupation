1: In this task, the amusement and recreation attendants are responsible for directing patrons to rides, seats, or attractions. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality. Since this task involves physical interaction and guidance of patrons in a real-world setting, it cannot be effectively completed using the LLM or any LLM-powered tools. The LLM does not have the capability to physically direct patrons or interact with them in person, making it unsuitable for this task.
