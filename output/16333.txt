1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of studying animals in their natural habitats as a Zoologist or Wildlife Biologist, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be impacted by the capabilities of the LLM.

- Zoologists and Wildlife Biologists study animals in their natural habitats, assess the effects of the environment and industry on animals, interpret findings, and recommend alternative operating conditions for the industry. This task involves a significant amount of fieldwork, data collection, analysis, and interpretation based on scientific principles and observations.

- While the LLM can provide information and insights based on existing data and knowledge, it may not have the capability to directly study animals in their natural habitats or assess the effects of the environment and industry on animals. This task requires hands-on fieldwork, observation skills, and scientific expertise that may not be fully replicable by the LLM alone.

- The LLM could potentially assist in providing background information, summarizing research findings, or generating reports based on existing data and studies in the field of zoology and wildlife biology. However, the core aspects of studying animals in their natural habitats and making recommendations based on field observations may still heavily rely on human expertise and practical experience.
