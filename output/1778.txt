1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of changing or rotating window displays for Merchandise Displayers and Window Trimmers, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it. 

- E0: This task involves physical work in changing or rotating displays, which cannot be done by the LLM or any software tool. It requires hands-on interaction and decision-making based on physical space and aesthetics, making it unsuitable for automation by the LLM.

- E1: While the LLM could potentially assist in generating ideas for new displays or drafting promotional signage, the actual physical work of changing or rotating displays cannot be automated by the LLM. The task involves a high degree of human interaction and physical movement, which the LLM cannot replicate.

- E2: It is conceivable that software could be developed on top of the LLM to help Merchandise Displayers and Window Trimmers by providing design suggestions, inventory analysis, or even virtual simulations of display changes. However, the physical aspect of actually implementing these changes in the real world would still require human intervention.

- E3: The task of changing or rotating window displays does not involve image processing or detailed visual analysis that would benefit significantly from image capabilities. While the LLM could potentially assist in generating text content for signage or promotional materials, the core task of physically changing displays does not directly benefit from image capabilities.
