1: In this task, a Mixing and Blending Machine Setter, Operator, or Tender is required to open valves to drain slurry from mixers into storage tanks. This task involves a physical action of opening valves and requires hands-on work with machinery. It does not involve text input or output, complex instructions, or data analysis that can be easily performed by an LLM. Therefore, this task does not align with the capabilities of the LLM or any tools built on top of it. As such, this task falls under E0 as it does not benefit from exposure to the LLM.
