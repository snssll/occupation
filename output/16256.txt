1: In this task of stirring and straining soups and sauces, the main actions involve physical manipulation of food items. These actions cannot be directly performed by an LLM or any software tool. While an LLM could potentially provide information on recipes, cooking techniques, or ingredient substitutions, it cannot physically stir or strain soups and sauces. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not involve any text-based or image-based activities that could be significantly aided by an LLM.
