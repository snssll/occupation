1: In this task, a retail salesperson is required to place special orders for customers or contact other stores to locate specific items. With access to the powerful OpenAI large language model (LLM), the salesperson could potentially use the model to draft professional and persuasive emails to suppliers or other stores to place special orders. The LLM could also assist in crafting detailed product descriptions or specifications for the desired items, making the communication more effective. Additionally, the model could help in researching and finding contact information for other stores or suppliers. Overall, the LLM could significantly streamline the process of placing special orders or contacting other stores, saving time and improving the efficiency of the task.

Considering the above points, this task falls under the E1 category as direct access to the LLM through text input and output can reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality by at least half.
