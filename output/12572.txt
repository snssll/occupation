1: In this task, a lawyer is required to prepare legal briefs and opinions, as well as file appeals in state and federal courts of appeal. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task and how an LLM could assist in completing it. 

- E0: This task involves a high level of legal expertise, understanding of case law, and the ability to navigate the legal system effectively. While an LLM can provide general information and potentially draft some parts of a legal brief, it lacks the specialized legal knowledge and experience required to fully prepare legal documents and file appeals accurately.

- E1: An LLM could assist in drafting certain sections of a legal brief based on provided information, generating initial opinions, or even suggesting potential legal arguments. However, the task of preparing comprehensive legal briefs, forming opinions, and filing appeals involves complex legal analysis, case-specific details, and strategic decision-making that goes beyond the capabilities of the LLM alone.

- E2: While an LLM could potentially be used to summarize legal documents, research case law, or provide general legal information, developing software on top of the LLM that could significantly reduce the time it takes to prepare legal briefs, opinions, and appeals would require highly specialized legal knowledge, understanding of legal procedures, and the ability to interpret case law accurately.

- E3: The task of preparing legal briefs and opinions does not involve image processing or creation, so the image capabilities of the LLM are not relevant in this context.
