1: In this task, a Physical Therapist Aide is responsible for fitting patients for orthopedic braces, prostheses, or supportive devices and adjusting the fit as needed. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality.

- E0: This task involves physical interaction with patients, precise measurements, and adjustments that require hands-on expertise. The LLM cannot perform physical tasks or make precise adjustments, so it would not reduce the time significantly for an experienced worker to complete this task.

- E1: The LLM could potentially provide information on the latest orthopedic devices, fitting techniques, or general guidelines for fitting patients. However, the actual fitting process, adjustments, and hands-on work required in this task cannot be directly performed by the LLM. Therefore, the time savings with LLM access alone would not be significant enough to warrant an E1 label.

- E2: While the LLM could potentially assist in providing background information on orthopedic devices and fitting procedures, it would not be able to physically fit patients or adjust devices. However, with the development of additional software that combines the LLM's capabilities with virtual fitting simulations or augmented reality tools, the time required for fitting patients could potentially be reduced by half.

- E3: The task does not involve image processing, creating or editing images, or reading text from PDFs. Therefore, the image capabilities of the LLM would not significantly impact the completion time of this task.
