1: In this task, a dental assistant is responsible for cleaning and polishing removable appliances, such as dentures or retainers. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it. 

- E0: This task involves hands-on work that requires physical interaction with the appliances. The cleaning and polishing process may involve specific techniques and tools that cannot be replicated by the LLM or any software tools. Additionally, the task does not involve text-based information processing or analysis that the LLM could significantly aid with.

- E1: While the LLM could potentially provide information on general cleaning and polishing techniques for removable appliances through text-based instructions, the actual execution of the task still requires physical action. The LLM cannot directly clean or polish the appliances, making its assistance limited to providing written guidance.

- E2: It is challenging to imagine additional software built on top of the LLM that could significantly reduce the time it takes to clean and polish removable appliances. The task is practical and hands-on, requiring manual dexterity and physical presence, which cannot be replaced by software tools.

- E3: The task does not involve image processing or analysis that would benefit from the LLM's image capabilities. It is primarily a manual task that does not rely on visual information processing.
