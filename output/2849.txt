1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of conducting economic or commercial surveys as a Marketing Manager, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM can assist in completing it. 

- The task involves conducting surveys to identify potential markets for products or services, which requires gathering and analyzing data.
- The LLM can assist in generating survey questions, analyzing survey results, and providing insights based on the data collected.
- The LLM can also help in summarizing survey findings, generating reports, and making recommendations based on the survey results.

Given these considerations, the task can be significantly aided by the LLM in terms of generating survey questions, analyzing data, and providing insights. This assistance can reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality by at least half, making it suitable for an E1 label.
