1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of analyzing intelligence data to identify patterns and trends in criminal activity as an Intelligence Analyst, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The task involves analyzing text data (intelligence reports, criminal activity descriptions) to identify patterns and trends. The LLM can assist in processing and analyzing this text data efficiently, providing insights and potentially highlighting patterns that may not be immediately apparent. The LLM can help in summarizing information, generating hypotheses, and even suggesting potential connections between different pieces of data.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM can assist in analyzing text data, it may not have direct access to real-time intelligence data or specialized databases that Intelligence Analysts typically use. However, with additional software development, an application could be created that integrates the LLM's text analysis capabilities with real-time data retrieval systems to enhance the analysis process further.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Since the task primarily involves analyzing text data, there is no direct need for image capabilities in this scenario.
