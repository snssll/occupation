1: In this task, a Forensic Science Technician is required to prepare solutions, reagents, or sample formulations needed for laboratory work. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we can break down the task as follows:

- **Writing and transforming text and code according to complex instructions**: The task involves following specific instructions to prepare solutions and reagents, which can be considered as transforming text (instructions) into actions (preparing solutions).
- **Providing edits to existing text or code following specifications**: While the task doesn't involve editing existing text, it does involve following specific formulations or recipes, which can be seen as following specifications.
- **Writing code that can help perform a task that used to be done by hand**: While the task doesn't involve writing code, it does involve manual preparation of solutions that could potentially be automated in the future.
- **Maintain records of written data**: The task may involve documenting the preparation process, which falls under maintaining records of written data.

Based on the above analysis, the task of preparing solutions, reagents, or sample formulations for laboratory work aligns most closely with the E1 label, as it involves following specific instructions, transforming text into actions, and maintaining records of the process.
