1: In this task, the occupation involves setting up and operating machines to process materials. The specific task involves measuring, mixing, cutting, shaping, softening, and joining materials and ingredients before processing them in machines. This task is very hands-on and requires physical manipulation of materials, which cannot be done by an LLM. The LLM does not have the capability to perform physical tasks such as measuring, mixing, cutting, shaping, or joining materials. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not involve text-based or image-based activities that the LLM can assist with.
