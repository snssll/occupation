1: Hazardous Materials Removal Workers are responsible for removing or limiting contamination following emergencies involving hazardous substances. To determine the exposure label for this task in relation to the LLM, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves responding to emergencies and physically removing or limiting hazardous substances, which requires hands-on work and specialized training in handling hazardous materials. This task does not involve text-based information processing or analysis that could be significantly aided by the LLM. The LLM does not have the physical capability to remove hazardous materials or respond to emergencies in real-time. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM or any tools built on top of it.
