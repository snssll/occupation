1: In this task, a Special Education Teacher is responsible for instructing and monitoring students in the use and care of equipment or materials to prevent injuries and damage. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves providing instructions and monitoring students, which can be formulated as text input and output. The context for this task can be captured within 2000 words, and the task does not require up-to-date facts. The LLM can assist in generating instructions, safety guidelines, and monitoring strategies for students. It can also help in creating educational materials related to equipment and materials care. Since the task involves writing and transforming text according to specific instructions, the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality. Therefore, this task falls under E1 as direct access to the LLM can reduce the time needed to complete it by at least half.
