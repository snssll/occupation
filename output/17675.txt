1: In this task, a Cost Estimator is required to visit a site and record specific information related to access, drainage, topography, and utility services availability. With access to the LLM, the estimator could potentially use the model to assist in documenting the information gathered during the site visit. The LLM could help in organizing and summarizing the recorded data, generating reports, or even providing templates for data collection. However, the task itself involves physical presence at the site, interacting with the environment, and making on-the-spot observations that cannot be directly substituted by the LLM. While the LLM could aid in post-visit documentation, it cannot replace the need for the physical visit itself.
