1: For the task of assembling sets of assumptions and exploring the consequences of each set as a mathematician, the exposure to LLM can be analyzed as follows:

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** The task involves working with text-based information, which is well within the capabilities of the LLM. The model can assist in generating different sets of assumptions based on input criteria and exploring the consequences through text-based analysis. The LLM can help in organizing and structuring the assumptions and their consequences, potentially speeding up the process significantly.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the LLM can assist in generating and analyzing text-based content, there might be additional software that could be developed on top of the LLM to enhance the exploration of consequences further. This could include specialized tools for mathematical analysis or visualization of the consequences, which the LLM alone may not provide.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Since the task primarily involves text-based analysis of assumptions and consequences, image capabilities are not directly relevant here. The task does not require image processing or visualization beyond what can be handled through text.

Considering the nature of the task and the capabilities of the LLM, it seems that the task falls under **E1 (Direct exposure)** as the LLM can directly assist in generating and analyzing text-based content related to assembling sets of assumptions and exploring their consequences.
