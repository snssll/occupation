1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of applying new technologies developed to minimize the environmental impact of coal mining for Continuous Mining Machine Operators, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves staying updated on new technologies and implementing them to reduce environmental impact. 

- E0: This task involves practical implementation of new technologies in a specific industry (coal mining) to address environmental concerns. The task requires hands-on work and expertise in the field, which cannot be fully replaced by the LLM.

- E1: The LLM can provide information on new technologies developed to minimize environmental impact in coal mining. It can help in researching and summarizing information on these technologies. However, the actual implementation and hands-on work required in applying these technologies would still need human expertise and cannot be fully automated by the LLM.

- E2: While the LLM can assist in researching and summarizing information on new technologies, additional software could potentially be developed to analyze the environmental impact of different technologies and provide recommendations based on data. This software could leverage the LLM's capabilities to process and analyze large amounts of information to suggest the most effective technologies for reducing environmental impact in coal mining.

- E3: The task does not involve image processing or detailed visual analysis, so the image capabilities of the LLM are not directly relevant here.
