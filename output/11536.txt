1: In this task, a Diagnostic Medical Sonographer is required to perform medical procedures such as administering oxygen, inserting and removing airways, taking vital signs, or giving emergency treatment like first aid or CPR. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality.

- E0: This task involves hands-on medical procedures that require physical interaction and expertise in providing emergency medical care. The LLM cannot physically administer oxygen, insert airways, or perform CPR, so it cannot directly assist in completing these tasks.

- E1: The LLM could potentially provide information or guidance on medical procedures, but in the case of emergency treatments like CPR, real-time physical actions are necessary, which the LLM cannot perform. While it could offer theoretical knowledge or step-by-step instructions, the hands-on nature of this task limits the direct assistance the LLM can provide.

- E2: While the LLM could potentially assist in providing theoretical knowledge or guidelines for medical procedures, the real-time and practical nature of emergency treatments like CPR requires immediate physical intervention, which the LLM cannot offer. Developing additional software on top of the LLM to provide real-time medical guidance or simulations for emergency treatments could be challenging and may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task.

- E3: The task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images, so the image capabilities of the LLM are not relevant in this context.

2: E0
