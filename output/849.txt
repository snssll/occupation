1: In this task, a Dental Laboratory Technician is required to apply porcelain paste or wax over prosthesis frameworks or setups using brushes and spatulas. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves manual dexterity and precision in applying the materials, which cannot be directly performed by an LLM. The task also requires physical interaction with the materials and tools, making it unsuitable for automation through text-based AI models. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM or any tools built on top of it.

2: E0
