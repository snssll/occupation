1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of recording and reviewing patient medical histories as a Dental Hygienist, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be aided by the use of the LLM. 

- Dental Hygienists typically record and review patient medical histories to ensure they provide appropriate dental care and treatment. This task involves documenting details such as medical conditions, medications, allergies, and past surgeries.
- With the help of the LLM, a Dental Hygienist could potentially streamline the process of recording and reviewing patient medical histories by generating structured templates for medical history documentation, providing prompts for relevant questions to ask patients, and offering suggestions for follow-up questions based on the patient's responses.
- The LLM could also assist in summarizing complex medical histories, highlighting key information, and flagging any inconsistencies or missing details in the records.

Based on these considerations, the task of recording and reviewing patient medical histories as a Dental Hygienist could be classified as E1 - Direct exposure. The LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality by providing assistance in structuring, summarizing, and analyzing patient medical histories.
