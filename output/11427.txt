1: In this task, a receptionist or information clerk is responsible for performing duties such as taking care of plants or straightening magazines to maintain the lobby or reception area. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if access to the LLM or LLM-powered tools can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality.

- E1: Direct exposure - The task of taking care of plants or straightening magazines is a physical task that involves manual labor and does not primarily rely on text-based or language processing capabilities. Therefore, direct access to the LLM would not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While it is conceivable that an application could potentially be developed to provide guidance or instructions on plant care or magazine arrangement, the nature of this task is more physical and practical rather than information-based. Therefore, the use of LLM-powered applications may not significantly reduce the time needed to complete the task.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - The task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images. Therefore, access to image capabilities would not have a significant impact on completing this task.

Based on the analysis above, the task of performing duties such as taking care of plants or straightening magazines to maintain the lobby or reception area is best classified as E0 - No exposure.

2: E0

3: Certainty level: High
