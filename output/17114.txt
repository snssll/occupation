1: In this task, the animal caretaker is responsible for training animals to perform specific tasks. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it. 

- E0: This task involves hands-on training of animals, which cannot be replaced by text-based interactions with the LLM. The LLM does not have the physical capability to interact with animals directly, so it cannot significantly reduce the time it takes to train animals.

- E1: While the LLM could potentially provide theoretical information on animal training techniques, it cannot physically train animals. The task of training animals involves practical, hands-on work that cannot be fully replaced by text-based instructions. Therefore, the LLM's direct access would not reduce the time it takes to complete this task by at least half.

- E2: It is conceivable that additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to provide virtual simulations or interactive training modules for animal training. This software could potentially offer guidance, tips, and strategies for training animals more effectively. However, the physical aspect of training animals would still require human intervention, limiting the extent to which the LLM-powered applications could reduce the time to complete the task by half.

- E3: The LLM, combined with image capabilities, could potentially assist in creating visual aids or instructional materials for animal training. These images could help in demonstrating training techniques or illustrating concepts to aid in the training process. However, the physical act of training animals would still require hands-on interaction, which cannot be replaced by image capabilities alone.
