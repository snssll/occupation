1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of writing poetry for publication as a Poet, Lyricist, or Creative Writer, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves writing creative content, which is a complex and subjective process that requires creativity, emotion, and originality. While the LLM can assist in generating text and providing suggestions, the essence of poetry creation goes beyond just generating words.
