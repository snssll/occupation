1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of cleaning common areas, changing light bulbs, and making minor property repairs for Property, Real Estate, and Community Association Managers, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves physical actions such as cleaning and making repairs, which cannot be directly performed by the LLM. While the LLM can provide information on how to clean specific areas or make minor repairs through text instructions, it cannot physically carry out these tasks. Therefore, the task does not fall under E1, as it cannot be directly completed by the LLM alone. Additionally, developing software on top of the LLM to automate physical tasks like cleaning and repairs would be challenging and may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task. As a result, the task does not align with E2 either. Since the task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images, it also does not fit under E3. Therefore, the most appropriate label for this task is E0.

2: E0

3: High
