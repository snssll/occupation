1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of filling cracks, holes, or joints as a Painter in Construction and Maintenance, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be impacted by the use of an LLM.

- The task involves manual labor and physical skills that cannot be directly replaced by text-based instructions or responses from an LLM.
- The task requires hands-on work with tools like caulking guns and putty knives, which cannot be operated by an LLM.
- The task does not involve complex decision-making, analysis of large amounts of data, or specialized knowledge that would significantly benefit from LLM capabilities.
- While an LLM could potentially provide general information on filling cracks or recommend specific products, the actual execution of the task is physical and cannot be automated by the LLM.

Based on these considerations, the task of filling cracks, holes, or joints as a Painter in Construction and Maintenance would be classified as E0 - No exposure to LLM.
