1: In this task, the occupation involves instructing customers in the installation, repair, or maintenance of products. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if the task can be significantly expedited or improved by using the LLM. In this case, the task involves direct interaction with customers, which requires human communication skills, empathy, and real-time problem-solving abilities. While the LLM can provide information on installation, repair, or maintenance procedures, it cannot replace the interpersonal skills needed to effectively instruct customers. Therefore, the task does not align with the capabilities of the LLM to the extent that it would significantly reduce the time or improve the quality of completing the task.
