- The task involves confirming information related to routes and destinations, which can be done through text-based inputs and outputs.
- The task does not require specialized domain knowledge beyond what can be captured in 2000 words.
- The task does not involve detailed visuals, precise measurements, or human interaction.
- The task does not involve making decisions that impact human livelihood or legal requirements.
