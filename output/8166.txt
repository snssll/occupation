1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of installing photovoltaic (PV) systems in accordance with codes and standards using drawings, schematics, and instructions, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it.

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** If the task involves a lot of written instructions, codes, and standards that can be easily accessed and interpreted by the LLM within a 2000-word context, then the LLM could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task by providing guidance, clarifications, or even generating specific installation instructions based on the provided information.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the task may not be directly reducible to text-based interactions, there could be software developed on top of the LLM that could assist in summarizing complex installation procedures, retrieving up-to-date information on codes and standards, or even providing recommendations on the most efficient installation methods based on data analysis.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Since the task involves using drawings and schematics, having image capabilities could potentially assist in visualizing the installation process, creating or editing digital images of the installation layout, or even scanning images for detailed instructions that may not be easily translatable into text.
