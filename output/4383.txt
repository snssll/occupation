1: In this task, an aerospace engineer is required to design new or modify existing aerospace systems to reduce polluting emissions. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves a high level of technical expertise and specialized knowledge in aerospace engineering. While the LLM can provide general information on aerospace engineering principles and emission reduction techniques, it may not have access to the latest research, regulations, or industry-specific data required for designing aerospace systems to reduce emissions. The task also involves complex calculations, simulations, and considerations of various factors that may not be easily handled by the LLM alone. Therefore, the task falls under E0 as it requires specialized domain knowledge, up-to-date information, and complex problem-solving skills beyond the capabilities of the LLM.
