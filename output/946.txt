1: In this task, a Purchasing Manager is responsible for arranging the disposal of surplus materials. To complete this task, the manager would need to coordinate with relevant parties to ensure the surplus materials are disposed of properly, which may involve negotiating with disposal companies, overseeing the removal process, and ensuring compliance with regulations.

To determine the exposure level, we can break down the task:
- Researching disposal options: The LLM can assist in providing information on various disposal methods and companies.
- Coordinating with disposal companies: The LLM can help draft emails or communication to arrange for the disposal.
- Ensuring compliance with regulations: The LLM can provide information on relevant regulations and guidelines.

Given that the task involves a significant amount of coordination, negotiation, and compliance, it is unlikely that the LLM alone can reduce the time it takes to complete the task by at least half. While the LLM can provide information and assist in drafting communications, the human element of negotiation and coordination is crucial and cannot be fully automated.
