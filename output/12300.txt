1: In this task, the Foreign Language and Literature Teacher, Postsecondary, is required to prepare and deliver lectures to students on topics related to foreign languages and cultures. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if direct access to the LLM could significantly reduce the time it takes to prepare and deliver these lectures with equivalent quality. The LLM could assist in generating lecture notes, providing additional information on cultural aspects, helping with language translation, and even creating engaging content for the lectures. However, the task also involves a significant amount of human interaction, understanding student needs, adapting to their learning styles, and providing personalized feedback, which may not be fully replaceable by the LLM. Therefore, while the LLM can be a valuable tool in aiding lecture preparation, it may not reduce the time by at least half due to the interactive and personalized nature of teaching.
