1: In this task for Pharmacy Technicians, the main responsibilities include receiving and storing incoming supplies, verifying quantities against invoices, checking for outdated medications in current inventory, and informing supervisors of stock needs and shortages. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes for a Pharmacy Technician to complete these tasks with high quality.

- Pharmacy Technicians typically deal with inventory management, which involves checking and updating stock levels, verifying orders, and ensuring medication safety.
- The task does not involve complex decision-making or specialized domain knowledge that would require the LLM's capabilities beyond text input and output.
- The LLM could potentially assist in generating reports, summarizing information related to stock levels, or providing templates for inventory management.
- While the LLM could help with written communication related to stock needs and shortages, it may not significantly reduce the time it takes to physically handle and organize supplies.

Based on these considerations, the task of receiving and storing supplies, verifying quantities, checking for outdated medications, and informing supervisors of stock needs and shortages could be classified as E1. The LLM could assist in generating written reports, summaries, or communication related to inventory management tasks.
