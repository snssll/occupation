1: In this task, the occupation involves planting grass with seed spreaders and operating straw blowers to cover seeded areas with mixtures of asphalt and straw. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone or with additional software could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality.

- The task involves physical labor and hands-on work that cannot be directly replaced by text-based instructions or responses from the LLM.
- The task requires specific skills related to handling equipment and materials, which cannot be easily replicated by the LLM.
- The task involves outdoor work and practical knowledge that goes beyond text-based information.

Based on these considerations, it is clear that the task of planting grass with seed spreaders and operating straw blowers falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM or any software that could be developed on top of it.

2: E0

3: High
