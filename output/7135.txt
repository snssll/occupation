1: In this task, a Mental Health Counselor is required to gather information about community mental health needs or resources that could be used in conjunction with therapy. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves researching and gathering information, which can be done effectively using the LLM to search for relevant data and resources.
- The LLM can assist in summarizing information, providing insights, and potentially even suggesting strategies based on the gathered data.
- While the task does not involve complex visual analysis or detailed image processing, it primarily relies on text-based information retrieval and analysis, which aligns well with the capabilities of the LLM.

Based on these considerations, the task falls under E1 as the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to gather and analyze information related to community mental health needs or resources.
