1: In this task, a Textile Cutting Machine Setter, Operator, or Tender is required to place patterns on layers of fabric and cut the fabric following those patterns using various cutting devices. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be significantly aided by the language model. The task involves physical manipulation of fabric and machinery, which cannot be directly assisted by the LLM. While the LLM could potentially provide information on cutting techniques or safety guidelines, the core task of physically cutting fabric based on patterns cannot be directly performed by the LLM. Therefore, this task does not fall under E1, E2, or E3 as it does not involve text input or output that can be significantly aided by the LLM.
