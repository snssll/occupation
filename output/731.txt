1: In this task, a Loan Interviewer or Clerk is required to answer questions and provide advice to customers regarding loans and transactions. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- Loan Interviewers and Clerks typically rely on their knowledge of loan products, policies, and procedures to assist customers. The task involves providing accurate information, explaining complex financial concepts, and guiding customers through the loan application process.
- The task does not involve highly specialized domain knowledge that would require advanced capabilities beyond what the LLM can provide. The information needed to answer questions and advise customers regarding loans and transactions is likely within the scope of the LLM's capabilities.
- The task does not involve detailed visual analysis, precise measurements, or physical interactions, making it suitable for text-based processing by the LLM.

Based on these considerations, the task of answering questions and advising customers regarding loans and transactions can be significantly aided by the LLM's text-based capabilities, as it can provide relevant information, explanations, and guidance. Therefore, the appropriate exposure label for this task is E1.
