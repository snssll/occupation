1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of obtaining and processing information required for the provision of services as a teller, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. In this task, the teller needs to gather and handle information related to financial services, such as opening accounts, savings plans, and purchasing bonds. The LLM can assist in providing general information about these financial services, explaining the process of opening accounts, savings plans, and purchasing bonds, and potentially generating sample scripts or responses for customer interactions. However, the task also involves practical aspects like handling physical documents, verifying identities, and processing transactions, which the LLM cannot directly assist with. Therefore, while the LLM can provide some information and guidance related to financial services, it cannot fully automate the task of obtaining and processing information as required for the provision of services.
