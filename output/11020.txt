1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of organizing and conducting experimental studies with live animals in controlled or natural surroundings as a Zoologist or Wildlife Biologist, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves hands-on work with live animals, which cannot be directly assisted by the LLM. While the LLM can provide information, research, and insights related to zoology and wildlife biology, it cannot physically conduct experiments or interact with live animals. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not involve activities that can be significantly expedited or enhanced by the LLM.

2: E0

3: High
