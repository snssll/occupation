1: In this task, a First-Line Supervisor of Office and Administrative Support Workers is responsible for arranging necessary maintenance or repair work. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the complexity of the task and whether the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete it.

- E0: This task involves coordinating maintenance or repair work, which typically requires direct human interaction, decision-making based on specific circumstances, and potentially physical inspections. The task does not involve writing, summarizing, analyzing text, or any other activity where the LLM could provide a significant time-saving benefit.

- E1: The task does not involve writing or transforming text, providing edits, summarizing documents, or any other text-based activity where the LLM could directly assist in completing the task more efficiently. While the LLM could potentially help draft communication related to maintenance or repair work, the core task of arranging for the work involves more practical considerations that the LLM may not significantly impact.

- E2: While the LLM alone may not reduce the time it takes to complete the task by half, it is conceivable that additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to streamline the process. For example, a specialized application could integrate with the LLM to automate communication with maintenance providers, track repair requests, or analyze maintenance data to optimize scheduling.

- E3: The task does not involve image capabilities, so this exposure level does not apply.
