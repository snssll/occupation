1: In this task, a Food Service Manager is required to investigate and resolve complaints regarding food quality, service, or accommodations. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we can break down the task as follows:

- Investigate complaints: The LLM can assist in providing guidelines, best practices, and potential strategies for investigating complaints effectively. It can offer sample investigation procedures and tips on gathering relevant information.

- Resolve complaints: The LLM can suggest possible solutions based on common industry practices, customer service principles, and legal considerations. It can help draft responses to complaints, provide templates for apology letters, or offer negotiation tactics.

Considering the nature of the task, which involves analyzing and responding to customer feedback, the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality. The model can provide valuable insights, recommendations, and language assistance to address complaints effectively.
