1: In this task, a Real Estate Sales Agent is responsible for arranging title searches to ensure clients have clear property titles. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves a specific and well-defined action: arranging for title searches. This task is primarily information-based and involves coordinating with relevant parties to conduct the necessary searches.
- The task does not require complex decision-making or specialized domain knowledge beyond real estate practices.
- The task does not involve detailed visual analysis, precise measurements, or physical interactions.
- While the task involves legal aspects related to property titles, it does not require legal expertise beyond what a Real Estate Sales Agent typically possesses.
- The task does not involve creating or editing digital images, reading text from PDFs, or scanning images.

Based on these considerations, the task of arranging for title searches for property titles falls under E0 as it does not significantly benefit from the capabilities of an LLM or additional software beyond what is commonly used in real estate practices.
