1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of selecting and combining shots as a Film and Video Editor, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves analyzing visual content (video shots) and making creative decisions to create a coherent narrative. While the LLM can assist with text-based tasks like writing scripts or providing feedback on written documents, it does not have the ability to directly interact with visual content such as video shots. The LLM lacks the capability to view, analyze, or edit images or videos, which are essential for video editing tasks. Therefore, the task of selecting and combining shots for a video editing project falls under E0 as it does not benefit from the LLM's text-based capabilities.
