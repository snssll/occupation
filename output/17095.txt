1: In this task, a file clerk is responsible for tracking materials removed from files to ensure that borrowed files are returned. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we can break down the task:
- The task involves maintaining records and tracking information, which can be done efficiently by an LLM through text input and output.
- The LLM can assist in creating a system to track borrowed files, generate reminders, and provide notifications for overdue files.
- The task does not require specialized domain knowledge or complex databases beyond what the LLM can handle.
- While the task involves some level of organization and management, the core function of tracking materials and ensuring their return can be effectively supported by the LLM.

Based on these considerations, the task falls under E1 as the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality by providing assistance in tracking and managing borrowed files.
