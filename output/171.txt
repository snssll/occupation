1: In this task, the Cutting, Punching, and Press Machine Setters, Operators, and Tenders, Metal and Plastic need to adjust ram strokes of presses to specified lengths using hand tools. This task involves manual adjustment of machinery, which requires physical interaction and precise measurements. The task does not involve text input or output that can be easily processed by an LLM. Since the task is highly manual and requires physical dexterity, it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM or any tools built on top of it. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not benefit from LLM exposure.
