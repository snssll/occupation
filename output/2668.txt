1: For the task of completing and mailing bills, contracts, policies, invoices, or checks as an Office Clerk, General, the exposure to LLM can be evaluated as follows:

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** The task involves writing and transforming text (such as filling out bills, contracts, policies, invoices, or checks) according to specific instructions. The LLM can assist in generating the text required for these documents based on the input data provided. It can also help in proofreading and ensuring accuracy in the content. Additionally, the LLM can provide guidance on the format and structure of these documents. Therefore, direct access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the task itself can be completed with direct access to the LLM, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to automate the process further. This software could potentially integrate with mailing systems, track document completion status, and provide reminders for pending tasks. Such applications could enhance efficiency but may not be necessary for completing the task.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Image capabilities are not relevant for this task as it primarily involves text-based documents like bills, contracts, policies, invoices, or checks. Therefore, this task does not require image processing capabilities.

Based on the above analysis, the most suitable label for this task would be **E1 (Direct exposure)**.
