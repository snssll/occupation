1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of preparing test stations for fuel cell components, we need to consider the level of automation and complexity involved in this task. 

- E0: This task involves physical setup and instrumentation, which cannot be directly automated by an LLM or any existing software tools. It requires hands-on work and precise adjustments that cannot be performed by text-based AI models.

- E1: While an LLM could potentially provide guidance on the theoretical aspects of setting up test stations or instrumentation, it cannot physically perform the task of preparing the stations. The task involves practical skills and physical manipulation that go beyond the capabilities of text-based AI models.

- E2: It is conceivable that specialized software could be developed on top of an LLM to assist in the preparation of test stations by providing detailed instructions, diagrams, or recommendations based on specific requirements. However, this would still require human intervention for the physical setup and adjustment of equipment.

- E3: The task does not involve image processing or detailed visual instructions that would significantly benefit from image capabilities in conjunction with an LLM. The preparation of test stations primarily relies on technical knowledge and hands-on skills rather than visual information.
