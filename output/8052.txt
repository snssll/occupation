1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of installing active solar systems as a Solar Photovoltaic Installer in relation to exposure to LLM, we need to consider the nature of the task. Installing active solar systems involves physical work, such as handling equipment, connecting components, and ensuring proper installation. This task requires hands-on skills, technical knowledge, and physical coordination. While the LLM can provide information on solar technology, regulations, and best practices, it cannot physically install the systems.

Given that the task involves physical labor and practical skills, it falls under the category of tasks that cannot be significantly expedited or completed more efficiently with the use of an LLM. The LLM cannot replace the hands-on work and expertise required for this task. Therefore, this task is best classified as E0 - No exposure.

2: E0

3: High
