1: In this task of cleaning and lubricating parts as a Farm Equipment Mechanics and Service Technicians, the exposure to LLM can be evaluated as follows:

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** The task of cleaning and lubricating parts does not involve complex instructions, specialized domain knowledge, or the need for up-to-date information. It is a straightforward manual task that does not require text input or output. Therefore, direct access to the LLM would not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While it is conceivable that software could be developed to provide guidance or instructions on how to clean and lubricate specific parts of farm equipment, the task itself does not inherently require the use of an LLM or any advanced software. The task is more about manual labor and basic mechanical skills rather than information processing or decision-making that an LLM could assist with.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Image capabilities would not significantly impact the task of cleaning and lubricating parts for a Farm Equipment Mechanics and Service Technicians. This task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images. It is a hands-on activity that does not rely on visual information processing.

Based on the above analysis, the task of cleaning and lubricating parts as a Farm Equipment Mechanics and Service Technicians would be best classified as **E0 (No exposure)** to the LLM.
