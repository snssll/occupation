1: In this task, a Hearing Aid Specialist is required to counsel patients and families on communication strategies and the effects of hearing loss. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves providing counseling and information to patients and families, which primarily requires verbal communication skills and expertise in the field of audiology. While an LLM could potentially assist in generating information or scripts for counseling sessions, the core of the task involves human interaction, empathy, and personalized advice based on individual circumstances. The LLM may not be able to fully understand the emotional nuances and individual needs of each patient and family, which are crucial in counseling sessions. Therefore, the task is more reliant on human skills and expertise rather than text-based information processing.
