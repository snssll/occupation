1: In this task, a painter in construction and maintenance is required to remove old finishes from surfaces using various methods such as stripping, sanding, wire brushing, burning, or blasting. To determine the appropriate exposure label for this task in relation to the LLM, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves physical labor and manual work that cannot be automated by the LLM. The LLM does not have the capability to physically strip, sand, brush, burn, or blast surfaces. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not involve text-based or analytical work that can be significantly aided by the LLM.

2: E0
