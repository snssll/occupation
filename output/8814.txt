1: In this task, the occupation involves structural metal fabricators and fitters who are responsible for lifting or moving materials and finished products using large cranes. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM or LLM-powered tools can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality by at least half.

Given the nature of the task, which involves physical labor and operation of large cranes, it is clear that the task cannot be completed using the LLM or any LLM-powered tools. The task requires hands-on work, physical strength, and specialized skills related to operating heavy machinery, which cannot be replaced by text-based AI models. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM or any tools built on top of it.

2: E0

3: High
