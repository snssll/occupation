1: In this task of ordering and taking delivery of supplies as a fast-food cook, the exposure to LLM can be evaluated as follows:

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** The task involves a straightforward process of ordering supplies, which can be facilitated by using the LLM to draft emails or messages to suppliers, create lists of required items, or even compare prices and availability online. The LLM can assist in generating the necessary communication and documentation efficiently, potentially reducing the time taken to complete this task.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the LLM alone can streamline the communication aspect of ordering supplies, additional software could be developed to integrate with the LLM for more advanced functions. This software could automate the supply ordering process, track inventory levels, predict future supply needs based on historical data, or even optimize delivery schedules. Such applications could significantly enhance the efficiency of managing supplies in a fast-food setting.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Image capabilities would not have a direct impact on the task of ordering and taking delivery of supplies for fast-food cooks. This task primarily involves text-based communication and logistics, which can be effectively handled by the LLM without the need for image processing.
