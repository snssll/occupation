1: In this task, a Gambling Manager is responsible for establishing policies related to various aspects of a gambling establishment, such as the type of gambling offered, odds, credit extension, and serving of food and beverages. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it. 

- E0: This task involves making critical decisions that impact the operations and regulations of a gambling establishment. It requires a deep understanding of the industry, legal considerations, and customer preferences. The task also involves a level of human judgment and interaction that cannot be easily replaced by an LLM.

- E1: While the LLM could potentially provide information on general gambling policies and regulations, it is unlikely to significantly reduce the time it takes for a Gambling Manager to establish specific policies tailored to their establishment. The task involves complex decision-making that goes beyond information retrieval or basic policy formulation.

- E2: An LLM-powered application could potentially assist a Gambling Manager by providing insights into industry trends, regulatory changes, or best practices in the gambling sector. It could help in summarizing large volumes of information or analyzing data to inform policy decisions. However, the task still requires human expertise and judgment to set policies that align with the specific needs of the establishment.

- E3: The task does not involve image processing or detailed visual analysis, so exposure to image capabilities would not significantly impact the completion of this task.
