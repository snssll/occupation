1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of preparing plans, estimates, design and construction schedules, and contract specifications for Marine Engineers and Naval Architects, we need to consider the level of exposure to LLM.

- This task involves a significant amount of text-based work, including drafting plans, estimates, schedules, and specifications. The LLM can assist in generating and refining text-based documents, providing suggestions, and ensuring clarity and coherence in the written content.
- The task does not involve precise measurements or detailed visual analysis, which are limitations for LLM capabilities.
- While the task may require some domain-specific knowledge related to marine engineering and naval architecture, the LLM can still assist in generating and refining the written content based on the input provided.
- The task does not involve highly specialized domain knowledge retrieval or real-time up-to-date information retrieval, which are capabilities that could be developed on top of the LLM.

Based on these considerations, the task of preparing plans, estimates, design and construction schedules, and contract specifications for Marine Engineers and Naval Architects would likely fall under label E1, as the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality by providing assistance in writing and transforming text according to complex instructions.
