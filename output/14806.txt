1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of researching the target audience of projects as a Graphic Designer, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. In this task, the LLM can assist in providing information on general target audience demographics, preferences, and trends based on existing data and knowledge. The LLM can help summarize information from various sources and generate insights that can guide the designer in understanding the target audience better. However, since this task involves understanding specific project requirements and context, as well as potentially conducting in-depth research beyond what is readily available in existing data, the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with high quality. While the LLM can provide some general information, the task may require domain-specific knowledge and nuanced understanding that the LLM may not possess without additional specialized software or tools.
