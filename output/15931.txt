1: In this task, the farmworker is responsible for shifting animals between grazing areas to ensure they have enough food. To determine the appropriate label, we need to consider if access to the LLM would significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced farmworker to complete this task with high quality. The task involves physical labor and direct interaction with animals, which cannot be replaced by text-based tools like the LLM. The task also requires knowledge of animal behavior, grazing patterns, and physical capabilities, which are not within the scope of what the LLM can provide. Therefore, the task does not align with the capabilities of the LLM, and it falls under E0.

2: E0

3: High
