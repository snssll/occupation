1: In this task, the roofer is responsible for installing vapor barriers or insulation on flat roofs. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes for a roofer to complete this task with high quality. Since this task involves physical labor, precise measurements, and hands-on work, it is unlikely that the LLM or any tool built on top of it can assist in completing the task. The task requires practical skills, knowledge of materials, and physical abilities that cannot be substituted by text-based information or recommendations from the LLM.
