1: In this task, a Counter and Rental Clerk interacts directly with customers, providing information about merchandise available for rental. The task involves verbal communication, understanding customer needs, and recommending suitable products. The task does not involve complex data analysis, specialized domain knowledge, or detailed written documentation. The task is primarily focused on customer service and communication skills.

Considering the nature of the task, it does not involve text-based interactions that would significantly benefit from the capabilities of an LLM. The task requires human interaction, understanding customer preferences, and providing personalized recommendations, which are not areas where an LLM would provide a substantial advantage. Therefore, the task does not align with any of the exposure levels in the rubric.
