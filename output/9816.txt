1: In this task, a Food Preparation Worker is required to mix ingredients for various types of salads. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the complexity of the task and the potential for automation using the LLM. 

- Food preparation involves physical actions such as cutting, chopping, and mixing ingredients, which cannot be directly performed by the LLM.
- While the task description is straightforward, it involves manual labor and physical coordination, which are not within the capabilities of the LLM.
- The task does not involve complex decision-making, analysis, or specialized knowledge that would benefit significantly from LLM capabilities.
- The task does not require text input or output, making it unsuitable for direct interaction with the LLM.

Based on these considerations, the task of mixing ingredients for salads is best classified as E0 - No exposure to LLM.
