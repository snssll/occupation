1: In this task, an Information Security Engineer is required to develop or implement software tools to assist in the detection, prevention, and analysis of security threats. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we can break down the task as follows:

- Writing and transforming text and code according to complex instructions: The task involves developing or implementing software tools, which may require writing code and text instructions.
- Providing edits to existing text or code following specifications: The engineer may need to edit existing code or text to improve security tools.
- Writing code that can help perform a task that used to be done by hand: The engineer is likely writing code to automate security threat detection and prevention tasks.
- Make recommendations given data or written input: The engineer may need to analyze data and provide recommendations for improving security measures.

Considering these aspects, the task involves a significant amount of writing code, providing edits, and making recommendations based on data. Therefore, the task can be significantly expedited with the use of an LLM to assist in writing code, providing insights, and generating recommendations.
