1: In this task, a Chief Executive is required to conduct or direct investigations or hearings to resolve complaints or violations of laws, or testify at such hearings. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- Direct exposure (E1): The task involves conducting investigations, resolving complaints, and testifying at hearings, which are complex and require human judgment, legal knowledge, and decision-making skills. While an LLM can assist in drafting reports, summarizing information, or providing background research, the core aspects of conducting investigations and testifying at hearings involve human expertise and legal understanding that cannot be fully replaced by an LLM.

- Exposure by LLM-powered applications (E2): While an LLM could potentially assist in organizing information, drafting reports, or providing legal references, the task of conducting investigations, resolving complaints, and testifying at hearings is highly specialized and requires domain-specific knowledge and legal expertise. Developing software on top of the LLM to handle such tasks would be challenging due to the complexity and legal implications involved.

- Exposure given image capabilities (E3): Image capabilities would not significantly impact the task of conducting investigations, resolving complaints, or testifying at hearings, as these activities are primarily text-based and require legal analysis and decision-making rather than image processing.

Based on the above analysis, the task of conducting or directing investigations or hearings as a Chief Executive is best classified as E0 - No exposure.
