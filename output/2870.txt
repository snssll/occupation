1: In this task, a cardiologist conducts exercise electrocardiogram tests to monitor cardiovascular activity under stress. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes for a cardiologist to conduct these tests with equivalent quality. 

- E0: This task involves hands-on medical procedures that require precise measurements and human interaction. The LLM cannot physically conduct tests or interact with patients, so it cannot directly assist in performing exercise electrocardiogram tests.

- E1: The LLM could potentially assist in providing information on the latest research, guidelines, or best practices related to exercise electrocardiogram tests. It could also help in summarizing patient data or generating reports based on the test results. However, the actual conduct of the test, which involves physical interaction with patients and technical expertise, cannot be directly replaced by the LLM.

- E2: While the LLM alone may not reduce the time it takes to conduct the tests, additional software could be developed to assist cardiologists in analyzing the test results, interpreting data, or providing recommendations based on the findings. This software could leverage the LLM's capabilities to process and analyze medical data more efficiently.

- E3: The task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images, so the image capabilities of the LLM are not directly relevant to this task.
