1: In this task, a Real Estate Sales Agent needs to contact property owners to advertise their services and solicit property sales listings. With access to the LLM, the agent could potentially use the model to draft personalized outreach messages to property owners, create compelling advertisements, and even generate scripts for phone calls or emails. The LLM could also assist in researching property owners and properties to tailor the outreach efforts. Overall, the LLM could significantly reduce the time it takes to craft these communications and potentially improve their effectiveness.

Considering the capabilities of the LLM in generating text, providing suggestions, and aiding in communication tasks, this task falls under E1 exposure. The LLM can directly assist in writing and transforming text, providing edits, and generating content for outreach efforts, which would streamline the process for a Real Estate Sales Agent.
