1: In this task, the main activities involve physically loading materials into machines and adjusting feed mechanisms. These actions require manual dexterity and physical interaction with the machines, which cannot be performed by the LLM. The task does not involve complex decision-making, analysis, or information retrieval that would benefit significantly from LLM capabilities. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM or any tools built on top of it.
