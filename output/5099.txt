1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of developing or using mathematical or computer models for weather forecasting as an Atmospheric and Space Scientist, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. In this task, the LLM could potentially assist in providing information on existing mathematical or computer models used in weather forecasting, explaining the principles behind these models, or even generating sample code snippets for specific modeling techniques. The LLM could also help in summarizing research papers or articles related to weather forecasting models, providing insights on the latest advancements in the field, or even assisting in writing reports based on the model outputs.

Given that the task involves a high level of domain-specific knowledge and technical expertise, the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task by at least half. However, it is easy to imagine additional software that could be developed on top of the LLM to enhance the modeling capabilities, provide real-time data integration for weather forecasting, or even automate certain aspects of model development and validation. Therefore, the task falls under label E2 - Exposure by LLM-powered applications.
