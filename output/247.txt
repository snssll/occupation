1: In this task, the Advanced Practice Psychiatric Nurses are required to administer medications, including injections. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it. Administering medications, especially injections, involves hands-on skills, precision, and adherence to strict protocols to ensure patient safety. This task does not involve text-based information processing or decision-making that can be easily automated by the LLM. The LLM does not have the physical capability to administer injections or interact directly with patients. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM or any tools built on top of it.
