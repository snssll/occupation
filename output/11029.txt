1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of organizing and labeling materials and displaying students' work, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves understanding the context of organizing materials and displaying work in an educational setting, which can be described within 2000 words. The LLM can assist in generating text based on complex instructions, providing edits to existing text, and writing responses to specific requirements. In this case, the LLM can help in creating labels, organizing instructions, and potentially suggesting display ideas based on the input provided. However, the task does not involve highly specialized domain knowledge or require accessing up-to-date facts. Therefore, the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality, making it fall under label E1.
