1: In this task, an Executive Secretary or Executive Administrative Assistant is responsible for preparing agendas and making arrangements for meetings, including coordinating catering for luncheons. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- Direct exposure (E1): The task involves organizing and coordinating various aspects of meetings, which can be facilitated by the LLM in terms of drafting agendas, sending out meeting invitations, and possibly even suggesting catering options based on preferences. The LLM can assist in generating text for emails, drafting meeting agendas, and providing suggestions for meeting arrangements.

- Exposure by LLM-powered applications (E2): While the LLM can help with generating text and providing suggestions, there may be additional software that could be developed to streamline the process further. This software could potentially integrate with scheduling tools, catering services, and other resources to automate the coordination of meetings more efficiently.

- Exposure given image capabilities (E3): Image capabilities are not relevant for this task as it primarily involves text-based coordination and planning for meetings, with no requirement for image processing.

Considering the task involves text-based coordination and planning for meetings, the most suitable label appears to be E1 as the LLM can directly assist in generating text, drafting agendas, and providing suggestions for meeting arrangements.
