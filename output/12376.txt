1: In this task, the Food Preparation Worker is responsible for preparing and serving beverages like coffee, tea, and soft drinks. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

Food Preparation Workers typically follow set recipes and procedures to prepare beverages. The task involves a series of steps such as measuring ingredients, brewing coffee or tea, mixing drinks, and serving them to customers. While the task involves some level of manual work, a large part of it is following specific instructions and recipes.

Given that the task involves following a set process and specific instructions, an LLM could potentially assist in providing guidance on recipes, suggesting variations, or even helping with customer interactions related to beverage choices. The LLM could also assist in generating training materials for new employees on beverage preparation techniques.
