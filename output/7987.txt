1: In this task, a Laundry and Dry-Cleaning Worker is required to inspect soiled articles to determine sources of stains, locate color imperfections, and identify items needing special treatment. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. This task involves visual inspection of physical items, which cannot be directly handled by an LLM. The task also requires tactile feedback and sensory perception, which are not capabilities of the LLM. As such, this task falls under E0 as it involves physical inspection and decision-making based on sensory input that cannot be replicated by the LLM.
