1: For the task of assisting with duties in other areas of the store as a cashier, the exposure to LLM can be evaluated as follows:

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** The task involves providing assistance in various areas of the store, which may require written communication or instructions. The LLM can help in generating written instructions, responding to queries, or even drafting emails related to coordinating tasks. The LLM can assist in summarizing information or providing feedback on documents related to store procedures. Therefore, the LLM can directly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality by at least half.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the task may not involve highly specialized domain knowledge or complex databases, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to streamline the coordination of tasks in different store areas. This software could potentially provide recommendations based on store data or written input, making the task more efficient. However, the direct impact of the LLM alone may not reduce the time significantly.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Image capabilities would not significantly impact the completion of this task as it primarily involves assisting with store duties that do not require detailed image analysis or creation.
