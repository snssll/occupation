1: In this task, a mathematician is required to design, analyze, and decipher encryption systems for sensitive information. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The LLM can assist in tasks related to writing, summarizing, providing feedback, answering questions, and generating text based on input. However, the task of designing encryption systems involves highly specialized domain knowledge in mathematics, cryptography, and computer science. It requires expertise in algorithms, number theory, and cybersecurity, which are not directly within the capabilities of the LLM. While the LLM could potentially provide some general information or context on encryption, it cannot replace the specialized knowledge and skills needed for this task. Therefore, the task falls under E0 as it requires specialized domain knowledge beyond the capabilities of the LLM.
