1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of designing security policies, programs, or practices as a Security Management Specialist, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be aided by the use of a large language model (LLM).

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** The task involves writing and transforming text to design security policies and programs. An LLM can assist in generating detailed security policies based on input criteria, providing suggestions for best practices, and ensuring comprehensive coverage of security needs. The LLM can help in drafting documents, responding to specific security concerns, and maintaining records of security protocols.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While an LLM can assist in generating text and providing recommendations, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to streamline the process further. This software could include features like analyzing existing security data, making real-time security recommendations based on current threats, or integrating with security databases for up-to-date information.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Image capabilities are not directly relevant to the task of designing security policies and programs. The task primarily involves text-based work related to security needs and practices, making image capabilities less impactful in this context.
