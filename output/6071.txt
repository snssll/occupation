1: In this task, the funeral attendant is responsible for preparing the deceased for viewing at a funeral service. The task involves embalming, dressing, applying cosmetics, and placing the deceased in a casket. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if the task can be significantly aided by the use of the LLM. 

- The task of embalming requires specialized knowledge and skills that cannot be directly assisted by the LLM, as it involves physical procedures and techniques that are beyond the scope of text-based assistance.
- Dressing the deceased involves physical handling and dressing, which cannot be performed by the LLM.
- Cosmeticizing the deceased involves applying makeup and other cosmetic products, which are practical tasks that cannot be done through text-based assistance.
- Casketing the deceased involves physically placing the deceased in a casket, which is a manual task.

Given that the task involves physical actions and specialized skills that cannot be replaced by text-based assistance, it is clear that the LLM cannot significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task.
