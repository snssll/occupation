1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of gathering information from agents concerning job details, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves collecting specific information from agents, which can be done through written communication. The LLM can assist in drafting emails or messages to agents to request the necessary details. It can also help in summarizing the information received and organizing it for further analysis. However, the task does not involve complex data analysis or decision-making that would significantly benefit from the LLM's capabilities beyond basic text generation and organization. Therefore, this task falls under E1 as the LLM can streamline the process of communication and information gathering, reducing the time needed to complete the task with equivalent quality.
