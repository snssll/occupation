1: In this task, the occupation of Painters, Construction and Maintenance involves erecting scaffolding, swing gates, or setting up ladders to work above ground level. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality. 

Erecting scaffolding, swing gates, or setting up ladders involves physical work that cannot be directly assisted by the LLM. The task requires manual labor, precise measurements, and adherence to safety regulations. The LLM cannot physically set up scaffolding or ladders, and it cannot replace the need for physical labor in this context. Therefore, the task does not fall under E1, E2, or E3 exposure labels.

2: E0

3: High
