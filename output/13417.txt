1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of providing patients with contraceptive and family planning information as a midwife, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM can assist in completing it. 

- The task involves providing information to patients, which can be done through written materials, verbal communication, or a combination of both.
- The LLM can assist in generating written materials such as pamphlets, brochures, or educational resources on contraceptive methods and family planning.
- The LLM can also help in crafting responses to common questions or concerns that patients may have regarding contraception and family planning.
- While the LLM can provide information and resources, it cannot replace the personalized care and counseling that a midwife offers to patients.

Based on these considerations, the task can be completed more efficiently with the assistance of the LLM, as it can generate educational materials and responses to common queries related to contraceptive and family planning. However, the task still requires human interaction and personalized care, which the LLM cannot provide.
