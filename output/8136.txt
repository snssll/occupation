1: In this task, an Aircraft Structure, Surfaces, Rigging, and Systems Assembler is required to install mechanical linkages and actuators, using tensiometers to verify the tension of cables. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we can break down the task:
- Writing and transforming text: The task involves physical installation work, so there is no direct text transformation involved.
- Providing edits to existing text: There is no text editing required in this task.
- Writing code: No coding is necessary for this task.
- Translating text between languages: Language translation is not relevant here.
- Summarizing documents: No document summarization is needed.
- Providing feedback on documents: There are no documents to provide feedback on.
- Answering questions about a document: No document-related questions are involved.
- Generating questions: No question generation is required.
- Writing emails: No email correspondence is needed.
- Maintaining records: While some record-keeping may be involved, it is not the primary focus of the task.
- Prepare training materials: This task does not involve preparing training materials.

Based on the analysis, the task does not align with any of the exposure levels in the rubric as it involves physical installation work that cannot be significantly aided by the LLM.
