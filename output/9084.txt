1: In this task, the Mental Health Counselors are required to maintain the confidentiality of records relating to clients' treatment. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we can break down the task as follows:

- **Maintain confidentiality of records**: This task involves ensuring that sensitive information about clients' treatment is kept secure and private. The counselor needs to handle these records with care to protect the privacy and confidentiality of the clients.

- **LLM Assistance**: While the LLM can provide general information on maintaining confidentiality and the importance of data privacy, it may not have the capability to directly assist in maintaining the confidentiality of specific records. This task involves practical, hands-on actions to secure physical or digital records, which the LLM alone cannot perform.
