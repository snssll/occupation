1: In this task, a Film and Video Editor is required to record necessary sounds or obtain them from sound effects libraries. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it. 

- E0: This task involves physical actions such as recording sounds or accessing sound effects libraries, which cannot be directly performed by the LLM. The task also does not involve text-based inputs or outputs that the LLM could significantly assist with.

- E1: The LLM could potentially help in providing information on sound effects libraries, suggesting sources, or even generating text-based instructions on how to record sounds effectively. However, the direct impact on reducing the time it takes to complete the task may not be significant enough to warrant an E1 label.

- E2: While the LLM alone may not reduce the time it takes to complete the task by half, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to assist Film and Video Editors in managing sound libraries, organizing recordings, or even providing creative suggestions for sound effects. This additional software could enhance the efficiency of the task.

- E3: The task does not involve image capabilities, so the E3 label does not apply in this case.

2: E2

3: Moderate
