1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of analyzing a script for makeup artists, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves reading and understanding a script to identify events that impact each character's appearance. The LLM can assist in this task by providing insights into character descriptions, events, and context within the script. It can help in summarizing key points related to character appearances and events, which can aid in planning makeup for each scene. The LLM can also generate questions or suggestions based on the script analysis.

Considering the nature of the task and the LLM's ability to process text, provide insights, and generate relevant information, this task falls under E1 - Direct exposure. The LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to analyze the script and extract relevant details for makeup planning with equivalent quality.
