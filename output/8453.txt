1: In this task, the Appraisers and Assessors of Real Estate need to interview various individuals to gather relevant information about properties and their surroundings. With access to the powerful OpenAI large language model (LLM), the appraisers could potentially streamline the process of preparing for these interviews by generating a list of detailed and insightful questions to ask each type of interviewee. The LLM could assist in crafting questions that cover a wide range of aspects related to the properties, such as condition, market value, neighborhood characteristics, and more. Additionally, the LLM could help in summarizing the information gathered during the interviews, making it easier for the appraisers to analyze and incorporate into their assessments.
