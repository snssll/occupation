1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of establishing criminal profiles as an Intelligence Analyst, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could assist in completing it. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The task involves analyzing information to create criminal profiles, which can benefit from the LLM's ability to process and generate text based on complex instructions. The LLM can assist in writing reports, summarizing data, and providing insights based on the input data. Therefore, the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone can be helpful in generating text and insights, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to enhance its capabilities for analyzing large volumes of data, retrieving up-to-date information on criminal organizations, and making recommendations based on the analysis. This additional software could further streamline the process of establishing criminal profiles.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Since the task primarily involves analyzing text data to create criminal profiles, image capabilities are not directly relevant in this context. Therefore, this task does not fall under E3.

Based on the above analysis, the task of establishing criminal profiles as an Intelligence Analyst is best classified as E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications.
