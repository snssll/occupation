1: In this task, a General and Operations Manager is required to perform sales floor work, such as greeting or assisting customers, stocking shelves, or taking inventory. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality.

- E0: This task involves physical interaction with customers, stocking shelves, and taking inventory, which cannot be automated by the LLM. The task also requires on-the-spot decision-making and physical presence, making it unsuitable for automation by the LLM.
- E1: The LLM could potentially assist in generating written materials related to sales floor work, such as creating training manuals or providing email templates for customer interactions. However, the core tasks of greeting customers, stocking shelves, and taking inventory require physical presence and actions that cannot be replaced by the LLM.
- E2: While the LLM could potentially help in creating documentation or providing insights on inventory management strategies, the core tasks of sales floor work are practical and hands-on, making it challenging to automate significantly with the LLM alone.
- E3: The task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images, so the image capabilities of the LLM are not relevant here.

Based on the above analysis, the most appropriate label for this task is E0.

2: E0

3: High
