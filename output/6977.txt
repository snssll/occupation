1: In this task, a helper is required to fill pipes with sand or resin to prevent distortion and hold pipes during bending and installation. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. This task involves physical actions such as filling pipes and holding them during bending and installation. It does not involve complex text-based instructions, writing, summarizing, or any form of data analysis that could be significantly aided by an LLM. The task also does not involve the use of images or require specialized domain knowledge that an LLM could assist with. Therefore, based on the physical nature of the task and the lack of text-based or image-related components, it is clear that the task falls under E0 as it does not benefit from LLM capabilities.
