1: In this task, a concierge is responsible for planning special events, parties, or meetings, which may involve booking musicians or celebrities. To determine the exposure label for this task in relation to the LLM, we need to consider the complexity of the task and the potential for automation or assistance from the LLM. 

- The task involves researching and coordinating various aspects of an event, such as finding suitable musicians or celebrities for booking.
- The LLM can assist in generating ideas for event planning, suggesting potential musicians or celebrities based on trends or popularity, drafting communication materials, and providing guidance on event logistics.
- While the LLM can provide valuable insights and suggestions, the task also requires human judgment, negotiation skills, and personal connections to successfully book musicians or celebrities.
- The LLM may not have access to real-time availability or pricing information for musicians or celebrities, which could limit its effectiveness in this specific task.

Based on these considerations, the task of planning special events, parties, or meetings, including booking musicians or celebrities, could be classified as E2 - Exposure by LLM-powered applications. While the LLM can offer support in generating ideas and providing information, additional software that integrates real-time availability and pricing data could further enhance its capabilities for this task.
