1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of investigating diseases or parasites as an epidemiologist, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves researching and analyzing information related to diseases, their causes, risk factors, progression, life cycle, and mode of transmission. The LLM can assist in providing information on known diseases, their characteristics, and general epidemiological knowledge. It can also help in summarizing research papers, generating questions for further investigation, and providing insights based on existing data. However, the task of investigating diseases requires specialized domain knowledge, access to up-to-date information, and the ability to interpret complex scientific data, which may not be fully covered by the LLM alone. While the LLM can provide some support in terms of general information and data analysis, it may not significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced epidemiologist to complete the task with high quality.
