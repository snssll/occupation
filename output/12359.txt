1: In this task, the occupation of dishwashers involves preparing and packaging individual place settings. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality. The task of preparing and packaging individual place settings is a manual, hands-on task that does not involve complex text input or output. The task does not require writing, summarizing documents, analyzing data, or any other text-based activities that the LLM excels at. Therefore, the LLM would not be able to directly assist in completing this task.
