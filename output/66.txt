1: In this task, an interpreter or translator is required to adapt translations to students' cognitive and grade levels, collaborating with educational team members as necessary. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- Direct exposure (E1): The task involves translating text to adapt it to students' cognitive and grade levels. An LLM could assist in translating the text and potentially provide suggestions on how to simplify or adjust the language for different grade levels. The LLM could also help in collaborating with team members by generating text for communication. Overall, the LLM could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality by at least half.

- Exposure by LLM-powered applications (E2): While the task could benefit from additional software that specializes in educational translation and adaptation, the core task of translating and adapting text could still be efficiently handled by the LLM alone. Therefore, the task does not necessarily require additional software beyond the LLM itself.

- Exposure given image capabilities (E3): This task does not involve image processing or detailed visual information, so the image capabilities of the LLM are not relevant in this context.

Considering the above points, the task of adapting translations to students' cognitive and grade levels, collaborating with educational team members as necessary, aligns more closely with E1 - Direct exposure.
