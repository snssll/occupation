1: In this task, an athlete or sports competitor receives instructions from coaches or sports staff before events and discusses performance afterwards. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes for an athlete to complete this task. 

- E0: This task involves direct human interaction between the athlete and the coach or sports staff. The LLM cannot replace this interaction as it requires real-time feedback, physical training, and personalized guidance that an AI model cannot provide. Therefore, this task falls under E0.

2: E0

3: High
