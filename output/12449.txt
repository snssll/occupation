1: In this task, a construction manager is required to prepare contracts or negotiate revisions to contractual agreements with various parties involved in a construction project. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM can assist in completing it. 

- E0: This task involves negotiating contractual agreements, which typically require human interaction, understanding of legal terms, and the ability to make decisions based on various factors. The task also involves complex negotiations that may involve nuances that an LLM may not fully grasp, especially in real-time negotiations.

- E1: While the LLM can assist in drafting contract clauses or providing general information on contract terms, negotiating revisions to contractual agreements involves dynamic interactions, understanding the specific needs of different parties, and making real-time decisions based on negotiation tactics. The LLM may not be able to fully capture the nuances of negotiation or provide the interpersonal skills required for effective negotiation.

- E2: It is conceivable that additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to assist in summarizing contract terms, providing legal insights, or even suggesting negotiation strategies based on historical data. However, the core aspect of negotiating revisions to contractual agreements still heavily relies on human judgment, understanding of context, and interpersonal skills.

- E3: The task does not involve image capabilities, so this label does not apply.

2: E0

3: Moderate
