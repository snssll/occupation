1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of arranging monies received in cash boxes and coin dispensers according to denomination for Tellers, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The task involves a straightforward and repetitive action of organizing money based on denomination. The LLM could potentially provide guidance on the most efficient way to arrange the money or offer tips on organizing large sums of cash. However, the task itself is primarily manual and does not involve complex decision-making that the LLM could significantly expedite.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not directly reduce the time it takes to complete the task, it is conceivable that additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to automate the process of sorting and arranging money based on denomination. This software could potentially analyze images of the money and provide instructions on how to organize it efficiently.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - The task does not involve reading text from PDFs or editing digital images, so the image capabilities of the LLM are not directly relevant to this task.

Considering the above analysis, the task of arranging monies received in cash boxes and coin dispensers according to denomination for Tellers is best classified as E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications.
