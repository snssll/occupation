1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of attending mediations or trials as a Claims Adjuster, Examiner, or Investigator, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it could potentially benefit from the use of a large language model (LLM).

- E0: This task involves physical presence at legal proceedings, such as mediations or trials, which require human interaction and observation. The task does not involve text-based activities that could be significantly enhanced by an LLM.

- E1: While an LLM could potentially assist in preparing written documents related to the mediation or trial, such as reports or summaries, the core task of attending these legal proceedings cannot be directly impacted by the LLM. The task involves real-time interactions, observations, and decision-making that are not text-based.

- E2: It is conceivable that an LLM-powered application could assist in summarizing legal documents, providing relevant case law references, or generating reports based on the outcomes of mediations or trials. However, the direct task of attending these proceedings would not be significantly impacted by the LLM alone.

- E3: The task of attending mediations or trials does not involve image processing or analysis that would benefit from additional image capabilities alongside the LLM. Therefore, this task does not fall under E3.
