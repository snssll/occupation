1: In this task, an Order Clerk is responsible for obtaining customers' information and entering it into order forms. With the help of a large language model (LLM), the process of entering this information can be significantly expedited. The LLM can assist in generating templates for order forms, extracting relevant information from customer interactions, and even automating the data entry process to some extent. This task involves writing and transforming text according to specific instructions, which the LLM can handle efficiently. Therefore, this task falls under the E1 category as direct access to the LLM can reduce the time it takes to complete the task by at least half.
