1: In this task, a Web Administrator is responsible for implementing website security measures like firewalls or message encryption. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- Web Administrators typically require technical knowledge and expertise in cybersecurity to effectively implement security measures on websites.
- The task involves understanding different security protocols, encryption methods, and firewall configurations.
- While the task involves technical implementation, it may not directly involve extensive text-based interactions or document analysis that could benefit significantly from an LLM.
- The task is more focused on technical implementation rather than text generation or analysis.

Based on these considerations, it is unlikely that direct access to an LLM would significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality. While an LLM could potentially provide information on security best practices or specific technical details, the actual implementation of security measures would require hands-on technical expertise beyond what an LLM can provide.
