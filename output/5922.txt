1: In this task for Medical Appliance Technicians, the main activities involve drilling and tapping holes for rivets, as well as assembling parts together to create prosthetic or orthotic devices. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be impacted by the use of the LLM.

- The task involves physical actions such as drilling, tapping, gluing, welding, and riveting, which cannot be directly performed by the LLM.
- While the LLM could potentially provide guidance on the assembly process or offer suggestions on best practices, the actual physical work of drilling, tapping, and assembling parts would still need to be done manually.
- The task does not involve complex decision-making, data analysis, or specialized knowledge retrieval that would significantly benefit from LLM capabilities beyond general guidance.

Based on these considerations, the task of drilling and assembling prosthetic or orthotic devices is not directly impacted by the use of the LLM in a way that would reduce the time it takes to complete the task significantly.
