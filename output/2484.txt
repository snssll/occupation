1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of communicating geological findings as a geoscientist, we need to consider how the task can be completed with the help of an LLM. 

- Geoscientists often need to write research papers to communicate their findings. An LLM can assist in generating written content, providing summaries, or even helping with the organization of ideas.
- Participating in conferences may involve preparing presentations, which an LLM can help with by generating slides, speech notes, or even answering potential questions that may arise during the conference.
- Teaching geological science at universities involves creating educational materials, such as lecture notes, assignments, or explanations of complex concepts. An LLM can aid in generating these materials, providing explanations, or even creating quiz questions.

Considering the nature of the task and the ways an LLM can assist in completing it more efficiently, it falls under the category of E1 - Direct exposure.
