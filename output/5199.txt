1: In this task, a Computer Systems Engineer/Architect is required to develop system engineering, software engineering, system integration, or distributed system architectures. To complete this task, the engineer/architect needs to have a deep understanding of various systems, software engineering principles, integration techniques, and distributed systems. The task involves designing complex systems that meet specific requirements, considering factors like scalability, reliability, and performance. The engineer/architect needs to analyze existing systems, identify areas for improvement, and propose new architectures to enhance overall system performance.

To determine the exposure level, we can break down the task:
- Writing and transforming text and code according to complex instructions: The LLM can assist in generating initial drafts of system architectures based on input requirements and specifications.
- Providing edits to existing text or code following specifications: The LLM can help in refining and revising system architecture documents based on feedback.
- Providing feedback on documents: The LLM can provide insights and suggestions on the proposed system architectures.
- Analyzing written information to inform decisions: The LLM can assist in analyzing data and information related to system requirements and constraints.

Considering the complexity and technical nature of the task, the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task by providing valuable insights, generating initial drafts, and assisting in the analysis of system requirements.
