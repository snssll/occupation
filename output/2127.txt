1: In this task of cleaning, lubricating, and touching up minor defects on newly installed or repaired appliances, the use of an LLM could potentially assist in providing step-by-step instructions on how to clean and lubricate specific types of appliances. The LLM could generate detailed procedures for cleaning different appliances, recommend suitable lubricants, and suggest ways to touch up minor defects. However, since this task involves physical interaction with appliances, such as applying lubricants and physically touching up defects, the LLM alone cannot directly reduce the time it takes to complete the task by at least half. While the LLM could provide guidance and information, the actual hands-on work is still required.
