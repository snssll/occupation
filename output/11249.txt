1: In this task, a Teaching Assistant (TA) is required to participate in teacher-parent conferences regarding students' progress or problems. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves communication, active listening, providing feedback, and potentially discussing sensitive information about students. While an LLM could potentially assist in drafting communication or providing information on educational topics, the core of this task involves human interaction, empathy, and understanding the nuances of parent-teacher dynamics. The LLM may not be able to fully capture the emotional intelligence and interpersonal skills required for successful teacher-parent conferences. Therefore, the task falls under E0 as it involves a high degree of human interaction and emotional intelligence that cannot be effectively replicated by the LLM alone.
