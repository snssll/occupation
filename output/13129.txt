1: In this task, the Fish and Game Wardens are responsible for protecting and preserving native wildlife, plants, or ecosystems. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone or with additional software could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task. The task involves on-the-ground work, monitoring, enforcement, and interaction with the environment, which are not text-based activities that can be directly assisted by the LLM. While the LLM could potentially provide information on laws, regulations, or best practices related to wildlife preservation, the core of the task involves physical actions and observations that cannot be directly influenced by text-based tools. Therefore, the task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM or any software that could be developed on top of it.
