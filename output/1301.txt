1: In this task, a midwife assists maternal patients in finding physical positions that will facilitate childbirth. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes for a midwife to complete this task with high quality. 

- E0: This task involves physical interaction and observation to assist patients in finding comfortable positions during childbirth. The LLM does not have the capability to physically interact with patients or observe their physical positions, so it cannot directly assist in this task.
- E1: The LLM could potentially provide general information on different childbirth positions, benefits, and considerations. It could also help in creating educational materials or guidelines for midwives to use. However, the task itself requires hands-on assistance and observation, which the LLM cannot provide.
- E2: While the LLM could potentially assist in creating educational materials or guidelines related to childbirth positions, it would not significantly reduce the time it takes for a midwife to assist patients in finding physical positions during childbirth.
- E3: The task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images, so the image capabilities of the LLM are not relevant here.
