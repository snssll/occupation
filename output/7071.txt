1: In this task, a First-Line Supervisor of Housekeeping and Janitorial Workers is required to forecast necessary levels of staffing and stock at different times to facilitate effective scheduling and ordering. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM can assist in completing it. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM can help in writing and transforming text by providing insights into historical data, trends, and best practices related to staffing and stock levels. It can also assist in summarizing information and generating forecasts based on the input data provided. The LLM can generate text that outlines the staffing and stock requirements based on the historical data and patterns, thereby reducing the time needed to manually analyze and forecast these levels.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone can provide valuable insights and assist in generating text-based forecasts, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to automate the process further. This software could potentially integrate with existing scheduling and ordering systems, retrieve real-time data on staffing and stock levels, and provide more advanced forecasting capabilities based on a wider range of inputs.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not directly relevant to this task as it primarily involves text-based forecasting of staffing and stock levels. Therefore, image capabilities would not significantly impact the completion of this task.
