1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of entering insurance- and claims-related information into database systems as an Insurance Claims and Policy Processing Clerk, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it more efficiently.

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** If the task involves a significant amount of data entry that can be streamlined by using the LLM to automate the process, such as extracting information from documents or emails and entering it into the database systems, then it could be classified as E1. The LLM could potentially assist in transforming text-based insurance and claims information into structured data for database entry.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** If there are additional software applications that could be developed on top of the LLM to further enhance the efficiency of entering insurance- and claims-related information into database systems, such as automating data validation, cross-referencing information, or providing real-time updates on policy changes, then the task could be classified as E2.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Since the task primarily involves entering text-based information into database systems, and there is no mention of image processing or analysis in the task description, it is unlikely that image capabilities would significantly impact the completion of this task. Therefore, the task is not classified as E3.
