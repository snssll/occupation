1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of opening, sorting, and distributing incoming correspondence for Executive Secretaries and Executive Administrative Assistants, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could assist in completing it.

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** The task involves handling written correspondence, which can be time-consuming and require attention to detail. The LLM could assist in automating parts of this task by helping to categorize and prioritize incoming emails and faxes based on predefined criteria. It can also draft responses or generate templates for common types of correspondence. This direct access to the LLM through an interface could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality by at least half.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the LLM alone can assist in automating some aspects of the task, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to further enhance efficiency. For example, an application could be created to integrate with email systems, learn from past interactions to better categorize incoming correspondence, and provide more personalized responses. This software could streamline the process even further, although the initial reduction in time may not be as significant as with direct access to the LLM.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Image capabilities would not significantly impact the task of opening, sorting, and distributing incoming correspondence, as it primarily involves text-based communication. The LLM's text capabilities are more relevant for this task.
