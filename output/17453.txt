1: In this task, the Wellhead Pumpers are responsible for unloading and assembling pipes and pumping equipment using hand tools. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality. Since this task involves physical labor and manual work with hand tools, it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM, which is focused on text-based tasks. The LLM cannot physically handle tools or equipment, so it cannot directly assist in unloading and assembling pipes. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not benefit from LLM capabilities.

2: E0
