1: In this task, a Software Quality Assurance Analyst is required to identify program deviance from standards and suggest modifications to ensure compliance. To complete this task, the analyst needs to have a deep understanding of software development standards, coding practices, and quality assurance processes. The task involves analyzing code, identifying deviations, and proposing solutions to bring the program back into compliance.

For this task, the exposure to LLM can be categorized as E2. While the LLM can assist in providing general information about software quality assurance processes and standards, it may not significantly reduce the time it takes to analyze specific code deviations and suggest modifications. However, with additional software development, a tool could be created that utilizes the LLM's capabilities to analyze code, identify deviations, and propose solutions more efficiently.
