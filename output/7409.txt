1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of identifying case issues and evidence needed as a Detective or Criminal Investigator, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can benefit from the use of a large language model (LLM).

- E1: Direct exposure - The task involves analyzing charges, complaints, or allegations to identify case issues and evidence needed. An LLM can assist in processing and analyzing large amounts of text data related to the case details, helping to extract key information and formulate a plan of action based on the analysis. The LLM can also generate questions or provide insights based on the input data, enhancing the investigative process.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the task can benefit from the text analysis capabilities of an LLM, additional software could be developed to summarize lengthy legal documents, retrieve up-to-date legal information, or provide recommendations based on the analysis. These applications could further streamline the investigative process and enhance decision-making.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Since the task primarily involves text analysis and decision-making based on legal information, image capabilities are not essential for completing this task. Therefore, this task does not fall under E3.

Based on the above analysis, the task of identifying case issues and evidence needed as a Detective or Criminal Investigator aligns most closely with E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications.
