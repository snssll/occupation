1: In this task, an Instructional Coordinator is responsible for coordinating activities related to educational materials and equipment in curriculum libraries and laboratories. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be significantly expedited or improved by using the language model. 

- The task involves coordinating activities, which may require communication, organization, and management skills that are not directly related to text generation or analysis.
- While the LLM could potentially assist in creating documentation or instructions related to the coordination of materials and equipment, the core task of coordinating activities may not be directly impacted by the language model.
- The task does not involve complex data analysis, specialized domain knowledge retrieval, or image processing that would significantly benefit from LLM capabilities.

Based on these considerations, it seems that the task of coordinating activities of workers in educational settings is not directly impacted by the use of an LLM to a significant extent.
