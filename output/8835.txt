1: In this task, a Food Cooking Machine Operator and Tender is required to listen for malfunction alarms, shut down equipment, and notify supervisors when necessary. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves auditory input (listening for alarms) and responding accordingly by shutting down equipment and notifying supervisors. Since the task does not involve text input or output, and it requires immediate physical action based on auditory cues, it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM. The LLM cannot listen for sounds or physically shut down equipment. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not benefit from LLM capabilities.

2: E0
