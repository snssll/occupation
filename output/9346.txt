1: In this task, the helper-roofer is responsible for maintaining tools and equipment used in roofing work. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. Maintaining tools and equipment involves tasks such as cleaning, inspecting, repairing, and organizing tools to ensure they are in good working condition. This task does not involve complex text input or output that would benefit significantly from the use of an LLM. The task is more hands-on and practical, requiring physical interaction with tools and equipment. Therefore, the use of an LLM would not reduce the time it takes to complete this task with high quality.
