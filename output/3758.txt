1: In this task, a First-Line Supervisor of Non-Retail Sales Workers is responsible for coordinating sales promotion activities, including preparing merchandise displays and advertising copy. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves coordinating sales promotion activities, which may require writing and transforming text for advertising copy.
- The task may involve providing edits to existing text for advertising copy following specifications.
- The task could potentially involve generating questions related to sales promotion activities.
- The task may also involve maintaining records of sales promotion activities and advertising materials.

Given that the task primarily involves text-based activities related to coordinating sales promotion activities, the most suitable label from the exposure rubric would be E1, as direct access to the LLM could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality by at least half.

2: E1

3: Moderate
