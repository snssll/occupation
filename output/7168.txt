1: In this task, the real estate broker's responsibility is to provide virtual tours of properties to potential buyers using computers. With access to the most powerful OpenAI large language model (LLM), the broker could potentially generate detailed descriptions of the properties, highlight key features, and even answer questions about the properties in a virtual tour format. The LLM could assist in creating engaging and informative virtual tour scripts that can be used during the tours. Additionally, the LLM could help in responding to specific buyer inquiries about the properties, providing accurate and detailed information.

Considering the capabilities of the LLM in generating text, providing information, and assisting in communication, this task falls under E1 - Direct exposure. The LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to prepare virtual tours and respond to buyer inquiries with high quality.
