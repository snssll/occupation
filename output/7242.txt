1: In this task, the Adult Basic Education, Adult Secondary Education, and English as a Second Language Instructors as well as Kindergarten Teachers are required to guide and counsel students with adjustment or academic problems or special academic interests. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if the task can be significantly expedited or improved by using the LLM. The LLM could potentially assist in providing guidance scripts, counseling techniques, or strategies for addressing specific academic issues. It could also help in generating personalized advice based on individual student needs. However, the task involves a high degree of human interaction and emotional intelligence, which may not be effectively replicated by the LLM alone. Therefore, while the LLM could provide some general guidance or suggestions, the core aspect of counseling and guiding students with complex needs may still require human intervention.
