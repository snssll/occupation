1: In this task, a boilermaker is required to attach rigging and signal crane or hoist operators to lift heavy frame and plate sections into place. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the complexity of the task and whether the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete it.

- The task involves physical work such as attaching rigging and signaling crane operators, which cannot be directly performed by the LLM.
- The task requires hands-on skills and coordination that are not within the capabilities of the LLM.
- The task involves working in a physical environment with heavy machinery, which is not something the LLM can interact with.
- The LLM cannot provide real-time assistance or physical signals to crane operators.

Based on these considerations, it is clear that the task of attaching rigging and signaling crane operators as a boilermaker falls under E0 as it involves physical actions and interactions that cannot be replaced or significantly aided by the LLM.
