1: In this task, a Diagnostic Medical Sonographer is required to select appropriate equipment settings and adjust patient positions to obtain the best sites and angles for imaging. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves technical knowledge related to medical imaging equipment and patient positioning, which may not be directly addressable by an LLM. The task also requires physical interaction with patients and equipment, which cannot be performed by the LLM. While the LLM may provide information on general medical imaging principles, it cannot replace the hands-on skills and expertise needed to perform this task effectively. Therefore, the task does not seem to benefit significantly from LLM capabilities, as it involves practical, hands-on skills that cannot be replicated by text-based AI models.
