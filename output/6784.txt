1: In this task, an actuary needs to explain changes in contract provisions to customers. To complete this task effectively, the actuary must have a deep understanding of complex insurance and financial concepts, as well as the ability to communicate these changes clearly to customers. The actuary may need to provide detailed explanations, answer questions, and address any concerns the customers may have regarding the changes.

Using an LLM, the actuary could potentially generate clear and concise explanations of the changes in contract provisions. The model could help in crafting language that is easy for customers to understand, breaking down complex concepts into simpler terms. The actuary could also use the LLM to anticipate potential questions customers might have and prepare responses in advance.

Considering these factors, the task of explaining changes in contract provisions to customers could be significantly aided by the LLM, as it can assist in generating tailored explanations and responses. This would save time for the actuary in preparing communication materials and addressing customer inquiries effectively.
