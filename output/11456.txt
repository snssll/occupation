1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of performing file signature analysis as a Digital Forensics Analyst, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be completed with the help of an LLM.

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** If the task involves writing and transforming text or code according to complex instructions, providing edits to existing text or code following specifications, or generating questions related to a document, then direct access to the LLM could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality. In this case, the LLM could potentially assist in analyzing file signatures and verifying files on storage media by providing insights, explanations, or even generating reports based on the analysis.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** If additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to summarize documents longer than 2000 words, retrieve up-to-date facts from the internet, or search through existing knowledge or data, then the task could be completed more efficiently. For example, an LLM-powered application could assist in cross-referencing file signatures with known databases or providing real-time updates on file signatures.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Since the task of file signature analysis does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images, the use of image capabilities provided by the LLM would not significantly impact the completion of this task.

Based on the above considerations, the task of performing file signature analysis as a Digital Forensics Analyst could potentially fall under **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications)** as developing specialized software on top of the LLM could enhance the efficiency of the analysis process.
