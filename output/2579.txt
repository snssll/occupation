1: In this task, an Agricultural Inspector is required to compare product recipes with government-approved formulas or recipes to determine acceptability. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves comparing text (product recipes) against a set of standards (government-approved formulas or recipes). This can be seen as a straightforward text comparison task that an LLM could easily assist with by providing guidance on the acceptability of the product recipes based on the government standards.
- The task does not involve complex visual analysis, precise measurements, or human interaction. It is primarily text-based and involves making a judgment based on the comparison of written information.
- While the task may require some domain-specific knowledge about agricultural standards, the LLM can still assist in the comparison process by providing relevant information and guidance based on the input provided.
- The task does not involve highly specialized domain knowledge that would require additional software beyond the capabilities of the LLM.

Based on these considerations, the task of comparing product recipes with government-approved formulas or recipes to determine acceptability could be classified as E1, as the LLM can assist in performing the text comparison efficiently and accurately.
