1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of locating or selecting environmentally friendly raw materials as a Supply Chain Manager, we need to consider the nature of the task and the potential impact of using an LLM. 

- This task involves researching and identifying specific types of raw materials that meet certain environmental criteria, which can be time-consuming and require sifting through a large amount of information.
- An LLM could assist in quickly gathering information on various biodegradable, non-toxic, or environmentally friendly raw materials available in the market.
- The LLM can help in summarizing information, providing recommendations, and potentially even suggesting alternative materials based on specific requirements.
- While the task may involve some level of domain-specific knowledge, the general process of researching and selecting raw materials can be significantly expedited with the help of an LLM.

Based on these considerations, the task of locating or selecting environmentally friendly raw materials for manufacturing processes as a Supply Chain Manager would likely fall under **E2 - Exposure by LLM-powered applications**. This is because while the task may not be directly reducible to half the time with just the LLM, the development of additional software leveraging the LLM's capabilities could streamline the process significantly.
