1: In this task, a Surgical Assistant is required to assess skin integrity or other body conditions post-procedure to check for any damage due to body positioning. This task involves observing and evaluating physical conditions, which cannot be directly assisted by an LLM. The task requires hands-on assessment and expertise in recognizing signs of damage or injury, which cannot be effectively replaced by text-based information provided by the LLM. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not benefit from the capabilities of the LLM.
