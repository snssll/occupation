1: In this task of applying de-icing fluid to aircraft from baskets lifted by truck-mounted cranes, the primary actions involve physical work such as handling equipment, operating machinery, and ensuring the safety of the aircraft during the de-icing process. These actions cannot be directly assisted by the LLM or any software tools related to it. The task requires hands-on work, coordination, and adherence to safety protocols, which are not within the capabilities of the LLM. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not involve any text-based or image-related activities that could benefit from LLM exposure.
