1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of giving network cues permitting selected stations to receive programs as a Broadcast Announcer or Radio Disc Jockey, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be aided by the use of a large language model (LLM).

- The task involves providing network cues to stations, which is primarily a communication task that requires clear and concise instructions.
- An LLM could potentially assist in generating standardized network cues or scripts for different stations based on the program being broadcast.
- The LLM could also help in drafting emails or written communications to send out these cues to the selected stations.
- While the LLM could aid in generating text, it may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task, as the core aspect of the task involves human communication and coordination.

Considering these points, the task could be classified as E2 - Exposure by LLM-powered applications. While the LLM could assist in generating text-based cues or communications, the task itself is not solely text-based and involves human interaction and coordination, which limits the extent to which the LLM can expedite the process.
