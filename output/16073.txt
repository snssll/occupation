1: In this task, a historian is required to speak to various groups, organizations, and clubs to promote the aims and activities of historical societies. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves communication, public speaking, and advocacy for historical societies. While an LLM could potentially assist in drafting speeches or providing information about historical societies, the core aspect of this task involves human interaction, public speaking skills, and the ability to engage with different audiences effectively. The LLM may not significantly reduce the time it takes for a historian to complete this task, as the key components involve personal interaction and communication skills that are not easily replicated by an AI model. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not clearly decrease the time it takes for an experienced historian to complete the task with high quality by at least half.

2: E0

3: High
