1: In this task, a Retail Loss Prevention Specialist is required to perform covert surveillance of areas susceptible to loss, such as loading docks, distribution centers, or warehouses. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

Performing covert surveillance involves physically monitoring locations to prevent theft or loss. This task requires on-site presence, observation skills, and the ability to respond in real-time to any suspicious activities. It does not involve text-based inputs or outputs that can be easily processed by an LLM. Additionally, the task involves physical movement and interaction, which cannot be replicated by an LLM. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of an LLM or any tools built on top of it.
