1: In this task, a Postal Service Mail Sorter is responsible for accepting and checking containers of mail from various sources. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves receiving and verifying containers of mail, which primarily requires physical interaction and visual inspection. While the task may involve some documentation or record-keeping, the core aspect involves handling physical mail containers. Since the task is primarily physical and does not involve text-based processing or analysis that could benefit significantly from an LLM, it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not benefit from LLM capabilities.

2: E0
