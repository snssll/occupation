1: In this task, an Atmospheric and Space Scientist is responsible for broadcasting weather conditions, forecasts, or severe weather warnings to the public via various media channels. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves transforming weather data and forecasts into easily understandable information for the public.
- The task requires providing real-time updates and warnings about severe weather events.
- The task may involve analyzing complex weather patterns and data to make accurate predictions.

Given these considerations, the task of broadcasting weather information involves a significant amount of real-time data processing, analysis, and communication. While an LLM could potentially assist in generating some parts of the weather reports or forecasts, it may not be able to access up-to-date weather data or provide real-time updates without human intervention. Additionally, the task involves human interaction and decision-making in determining how to present the information effectively to the public.
