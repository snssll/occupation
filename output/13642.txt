1: In this task, a Zoologist or Wildlife Biologist is responsible for raising specimens for study, observation, or experiments. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. Raising specimens involves various activities such as providing appropriate habitats, food, and care for the animals, monitoring their behavior, and collecting data for research purposes. While an LLM could potentially provide information on best practices for raising specific species or offer general guidance on animal care, the actual hands-on work of raising specimens would require physical interaction and specialized knowledge that goes beyond text-based instructions. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it involves physical actions and specialized skills that cannot be fully automated by an LLM.
