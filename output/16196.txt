1: In this task, a Cooling and Freezing Equipment Operator and Tender is required to start machinery, such as pumps, feeders, or conveyors, and manipulate valves to control the heating, admission, or transfer of products, refrigerants, or mixes. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if the task can be significantly expedited or improved by using the LLM. Given that this task involves physical actions like starting machinery and turning valves, it does not seem like the LLM can directly assist in completing the task more efficiently. The task is hands-on and requires manual operation of equipment, which cannot be substituted by the LLM.
