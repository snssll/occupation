1: In this task, the worker is required to install, maintain, or repair hoses, pumps, filters, or screens using hand tools to ensure the proper functioning of processing equipment. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be significantly aided by the use of the language model. The LLM could potentially assist by providing detailed instructions on how to install, maintain, or repair specific components, troubleshooting tips, or information on best practices. However, since this task involves physical work with machinery and hand tools, the LLM's text-based capabilities may not directly reduce the time it takes to complete the task. While the LLM could potentially provide some guidance or information, the hands-on nature of the task limits the direct applicability of the language model.
