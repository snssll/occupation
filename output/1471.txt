1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of attending workshops, seminars, or conferences to obtain program ideas, information, or resources as a Director of Religious Activities and Education, we need to consider how the LLM could assist in completing this task. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM could potentially help by summarizing information from workshops, seminars, or conferences, providing insights, or generating questions based on the content. It could also assist in preparing reports or documentation based on the information gathered. 
- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - Additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to automatically summarize key points from workshops, seminars, or conferences, provide recommendations based on the gathered information, or even help in organizing and categorizing resources obtained from such events.
- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Since this task primarily involves attending events and gathering information verbally or through written materials, image capabilities would not significantly impact the completion of this task.

Considering the above points, the task of attending workshops, seminars, or conferences to obtain program ideas, information, or resources could benefit from the LLM's capabilities in summarizing, generating insights, and assisting in documentation, which aligns more closely with E1 - Direct exposure.
