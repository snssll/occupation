1: In this task, a Parts Salesperson is responsible for placing new merchandise on display. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone or with additional software could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality.

- E1: Direct exposure - The task of placing new merchandise on display involves physical actions such as arranging items in a visually appealing manner. While the LLM could potentially provide guidance on display techniques or suggest product placement strategies, the actual physical act of placing the merchandise cannot be directly performed by the LLM. Therefore, direct access to the LLM would not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While it is conceivable that software could be developed on top of the LLM to assist in creating digital mockups of displays or generating layout suggestions based on data analysis, the physical aspect of placing merchandise on display would still require human intervention. The LLM alone may not be able to reduce the time significantly for this task.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities could potentially assist in creating digital mockups of displays or providing visual references for product placement. However, since the task involves physical actions in a real-world setting, the image capabilities alone would not be sufficient to significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task.

Based on the analysis above, the task of placing new merchandise on display would be best classified as E0, as none of the exposure levels would lead to a significant reduction in time to complete the task.
