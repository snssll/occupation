1: In this task, a Food Preparation Worker is required to wash, peel, and cut various foods like fruits and vegetables to prepare them for cooking or serving. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. This task involves manual labor and physical actions such as washing, peeling, and cutting, which cannot be directly performed by an LLM. The task does not involve complex decision-making, specialized knowledge, or extensive written communication that would benefit significantly from LLM capabilities. Therefore, the task does not align with any of the exposure levels that involve LLM assistance.
