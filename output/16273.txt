1: In this task, a cashier is responsible for stocking shelves, sorting and reshelving returned items, and marking prices on items and shelves. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- Stocking shelves involves organizing products in a store, which may require knowledge of inventory management and categorization.
- Sorting and reshelving returned items involves understanding product categories and ensuring items are placed back in the correct location.
- Marking prices on items and shelves involves accuracy in pricing and potentially updating pricing information.

Given the complexity of these tasks and the need for accuracy and organization, it is likely that the LLM alone would not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete these tasks. While the LLM could potentially provide information on inventory management or pricing strategies, the physical aspect of stocking shelves and handling returned items would still require manual work.
