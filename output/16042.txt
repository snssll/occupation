1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of sorting and filing deposit slips and checks as part of the Tellers occupation, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it more efficiently.

- E1: Direct exposure - The task of sorting and filing deposit slips and checks involves a straightforward and repetitive process that could potentially be automated or guided by the LLM. The LLM could provide instructions on how to organize the slips and checks, categorize them, or even generate templates for filing systems. This direct text-based guidance could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the task itself is relatively simple and may not require advanced capabilities beyond text-based instructions, it is easy to imagine additional software that could be developed on top of the LLM to further streamline the sorting and filing process. For example, an application could be created to scan and digitize the deposit slips and checks, automatically categorize them, and suggest optimal filing methods. This additional software could enhance the efficiency of the task.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - The task of sorting and filing deposit slips and checks does not involve image processing or detailed visual analysis. Therefore, the image capabilities of the LLM would not significantly impact the completion of this task.

Based on the analysis above, the task of sorting and filing deposit slips and checks as part of the Tellers occupation is best classified as E1: Direct exposure.
