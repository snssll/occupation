1: In this task, the Opticians, Dispensing need to prepare work orders and instructions for grinding lenses and fabricating eyeglasses. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we can break down the task:
- Writing work orders and instructions involves transforming text according to specific instructions, which is a task that can be efficiently handled by an LLM.
- The task does not involve highly specialized domain knowledge or up-to-date facts that are not captured in the input.
- The task does not require any image capabilities or detailed visual analysis.
