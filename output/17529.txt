1: In this task, a commercial pilot is required to use instrumentation to pilot an aircraft when visibility is poor. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The LLM can provide information and guidance on how instrumentation works, the procedures to follow in low visibility conditions, and general advice on flying in such situations. However, the LLM cannot physically pilot an aircraft or provide real-time assistance in the cockpit. Since this task involves real-time decision-making and actions that cannot be performed by the LLM, it falls under E0.

2: E0

3: High
