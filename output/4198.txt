1: In this task, a courier is responsible for delivering and picking up medical records, lab specimens, and medications to and from hospitals and other medical facilities. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves physical movement and interaction with medical facilities, which cannot be directly replaced by the LLM or any software tool. The task requires handling physical items and navigating real-world locations, which are beyond the capabilities of the LLM. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not involve activities that can be significantly expedited or replaced by the LLM.
