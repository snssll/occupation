1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of participating in the planning or development of mapping projects as a Remote Sensing Technician, we need to consider how the task can be completed with the help of an LLM. 

- Remote Sensing Technicians involved in planning or developing mapping projects may need to gather information, analyze data, and make decisions based on the data collected. An LLM could assist in providing background information, generating reports, summarizing data, and even suggesting potential mapping strategies based on the input provided.
- The LLM could help in researching best practices in mapping projects, providing insights into new technologies or methodologies, and even assisting in drafting project proposals or reports.
- While the LLM may not have direct access to real-time satellite imagery or specific technical details related to remote sensing technologies, it can still provide valuable support in the initial stages of project planning and development.

Based on these considerations, the task of participating in the planning or development of mapping projects as a Remote Sensing Technician could be classified as E2 - Exposure by LLM-powered applications.
