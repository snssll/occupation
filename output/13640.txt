1: In this task, the Railroad Brake, Signal, and Switch Operators and Locomotive Firers are required to raise levers to couple and uncouple cars for the makeup and breakup of trains. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if access to the LLM or LLM-powered tools can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality.

- E0: This task involves physical actions such as raising levers to couple and uncouple cars, which cannot be performed by the LLM or LLM-powered tools. Therefore, this task does not fit into the E0 category.

- E1: The task does not involve writing, transforming text, providing edits, translating languages, summarizing documents, answering questions, generating questions, writing emails, maintaining records, preparing training materials, or informing anyone via written or spoken medium. The task is more physical in nature and does not directly align with the capabilities of the LLM. Hence, it does not fit into the E1 category.

- E2: While it is conceivable that software could be developed to assist in the automation of certain aspects of train operations, such as signaling or scheduling, the specific physical action of raising levers to couple and uncouple cars may not be easily automated by an LLM-powered tool. Therefore, this task does not fit into the E2 category.

- E3: The task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images. It is more focused on physical actions related to train operations. Therefore, this task does not fit into the E3 category.
