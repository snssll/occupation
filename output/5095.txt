1: In this task, a First-Line Supervisor of Office and Administrative Support Workers is required to develop or update procedures, policies, or standards. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM can assist in completing it. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM can assist in writing and transforming text according to complex instructions, which could include drafting procedures, policies, or standards based on provided guidelines. The LLM can also help in summarizing existing documents to extract relevant information for updating procedures. Therefore, the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality.
  
- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone can be helpful in drafting text, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to automate the process of updating procedures, policies, or standards. This software could potentially retrieve up-to-date information from the internet to ensure the policies are current and relevant, thus reducing the time further.
  
- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not relevant for this task as it primarily involves text-based work related to developing or updating procedures, policies, or standards. 

Considering the above points, the task of developing or updating procedures, policies, or standards for First-Line Supervisors of Office and Administrative Support Workers aligns best with E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications.
