1: In this task, the airline pilot, copilot, or flight engineer is responsible for recording specific information in logbooks related to flights, such as flight times, distances flown, and fuel consumption. With the help of an LLM, the pilot could potentially dictate this information, and the LLM could transcribe it accurately into the logbooks. The LLM could also assist in organizing and formatting the data in the logbooks, ensuring that it is clear and consistent. Overall, the LLM could significantly reduce the time it takes to manually record this information in logbooks.

Considering the task involves writing and organizing data in a specific format, which can be easily done with the assistance of an LLM, this task falls under the E1 category. The LLM can directly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality by at least half.
