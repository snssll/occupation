1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of monitoring the progress of fundraising drives as a Fundraiser, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be supported by the capabilities of the LLM. Fundraisers typically track and analyze data related to fundraising efforts, such as donation amounts, donor engagement, and campaign success rates. With the help of an LLM, fundraisers could potentially automate the process of monitoring progress by inputting data and receiving analysis or reports on the status of fundraising drives. The LLM could assist in generating insights, identifying trends, and providing recommendations based on the data provided.

Given that this task involves analyzing data and generating reports, the LLM could significantly reduce the time required to monitor fundraising progress by automating data analysis and providing insights. This task falls under the category of providing recommendations based on data, which aligns with the capabilities of the LLM. Therefore, this task can be classified as E2 - Exposure by LLM-powered applications.
