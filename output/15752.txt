1: In this task, a stonemason is required to set stone or marble in place according to a layout or pattern. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes for a stonemason to complete this task with high quality. Since this task involves physical work and precise measurements, it is unlikely that the LLM can directly assist in completing the task. The LLM does not have the capability to interact physically with materials or accurately measure dimensions, which are essential for stonemasonry work. Therefore, the task does not fall under E1, E2, or E3 categories.

2: E0

3: High
