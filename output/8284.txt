1: In this task, the Exercise Trainers and Group Fitness Instructors are required to instruct participants in maintaining exertion levels to maximize benefits from exercise routines. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- E0: This task involves direct human interaction and physical activity, which cannot be replaced by an LLM or any software tool. The hands-on nature of guiding participants in real-time during exercise routines requires human presence and expertise.

- E1: While an LLM could potentially provide general information on maintaining exertion levels during exercise, the real-time, personalized guidance needed in this task goes beyond what an LLM can offer. The dynamic nature of adjusting exertion levels based on individual participant needs and responses requires human judgment and interaction.

- E2: Developing software that could assist Exercise Trainers and Group Fitness Instructors in providing personalized guidance during exercise routines might be challenging. The task involves real-time adjustments, physical observation, and personalized feedback, which are complex and may not be easily automated.

- E3: The task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images. Therefore, the image capabilities of the LLM are not relevant to this task.
