1: In this task, a Set and Exhibit Designer is responsible for acquiring or arranging for the acquisition of specimens or graphics needed to complete exhibits. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it. 

- E0: This task involves physical acquisition of specimens or graphics, which cannot be done by the LLM or any software tool. The task also requires coordination with external parties for acquisition, which involves human interaction and decision-making beyond the capabilities of the LLM.

- E1: The LLM could potentially assist in generating text-based instructions or communication related to the acquisition process. It could help in drafting emails, summarizing information about specimens or graphics, or providing feedback on written documents related to the exhibits. However, the core task of physically acquiring or arranging for acquisition of specimens is not something the LLM can directly perform.

- E2: While the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time to complete the task, additional software could be developed to help in researching and recommending sources for specimens or graphics. This software could leverage the LLM's capabilities to search for relevant information, summarize data on potential acquisitions, or even suggest creative ideas for exhibits based on input criteria.

- E3: The task does not involve image processing or detailed visual work that would require image capabilities in addition to the LLM. Therefore, this task does not fall under E3.
