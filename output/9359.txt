1: Prepress Technicians and Workers are responsible for preparing materials for the printing process. One of the tasks involved in this occupation is maintaining, adjusting, and cleaning equipment, as well as performing minor repairs. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality. In this case, the task involves physical maintenance and repair of equipment, which cannot be directly assisted by the LLM. While the LLM could potentially provide information on troubleshooting or repair procedures, the actual hands-on work required for equipment maintenance and repair cannot be done by the LLM. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not clearly decrease the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete the task with high quality by at least half.
