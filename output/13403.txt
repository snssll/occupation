1: In this task, a registered nurse is responsible for providing or arranging training for auxiliary personnel or students. To complete this task, the nurse would need to create training materials, conduct training sessions, assess the progress of the trainees, and provide feedback. With the help of a large language model (LLM), the nurse could potentially generate training materials, write instructions, develop training modules, and even create assessments. The LLM could also assist in answering questions from trainees or providing additional resources. Overall, the LLM could significantly reduce the time it takes to prepare for and conduct training sessions.

Considering the capabilities of the LLM in generating text, providing instructions, and assisting in educational tasks, this task falls under E1. The LLM can help in writing and transforming text, preparing training materials, and providing feedback, which are all essential aspects of this task.
