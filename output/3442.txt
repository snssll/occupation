1: In this task of constructing wooden models, patterns, templates, full-scale mock-ups, and molds for parts of products and production tools, the primary requirement is manual craftsmanship and woodworking skills. While an LLM could potentially provide some general information or guidance on woodworking techniques, it cannot physically construct these items. The task involves hands-on work that cannot be directly replaced by text-based instructions or information provided by the LLM. Therefore, the task does not fall under E1, E2, or E3 exposure categories as the LLM alone cannot significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with high quality.

2: E0

3: High
