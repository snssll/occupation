1: In this task, a Remote Sensing Technician is required to prepare documentation or presentations, including charts, photos, or graphs. With the help of the most powerful OpenAI large language model (LLM), the technician can generate text for the documentation or presentations. The LLM can assist in creating detailed descriptions, explanations, and analyses that can accompany the charts, photos, or graphs. However, the LLM itself does not have the capability to create visual elements like charts, photos, or graphs. Therefore, while the LLM can significantly aid in the textual aspects of the task, it cannot directly create the visual components required for the documentation or presentations. As a result, this task falls under E2 exposure by LLM-powered applications, as additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to handle the visual aspects and further streamline the process.
