1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of auditioning and selecting performers for musical presentations as a Music Director or Composer, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be aided by the use of a large language model (LLM).

- E1: Direct exposure - The task involves making decisions based on auditions and selecting performers. While an LLM could potentially assist in drafting communication materials or providing background information on performers, the core task of auditioning and selecting performers requires human judgment and interaction. The LLM may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While an LLM could potentially assist in researching performers, providing background information, or drafting communication materials, the task of auditioning and selecting performers involves a high degree of human judgment, interaction, and evaluation of performances. An application built on top of the LLM could potentially streamline some aspects of the research process, but the core task of auditioning and selecting performers may not be significantly expedited by LLM-powered tools.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities would not significantly impact the task of auditioning and selecting performers for musical presentations, as the task primarily involves evaluating live performances rather than images.

Based on the above analysis, the task of auditioning and selecting performers for musical presentations is best classified as E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications.
