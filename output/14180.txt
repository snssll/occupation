1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of recruiting and hiring staff members as a First-Line Supervisor, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be facilitated by the use of the LLM. 

- E0: This task involves human interaction, decision-making, and legal considerations related to hiring staff members. The task requires assessing candidates, conducting interviews, and making hiring decisions based on various factors beyond just text-based information. The LLM cannot make final hiring decisions or conduct in-person interviews, so it is unlikely to significantly reduce the time needed to complete this task.

- E1: While the LLM can assist in drafting job descriptions, screening resumes, and generating interview questions, the core aspects of recruiting and hiring staff members, such as conducting interviews, assessing candidates, and making final hiring decisions, require human judgment and interaction. The LLM can provide some support in the initial stages of recruitment, but it cannot fully automate the hiring process.

- E2: With additional software development, it is conceivable that an application could be built on top of the LLM to streamline certain aspects of the recruitment process, such as automated resume screening, candidate matching based on job requirements, or generating personalized feedback for candidates. However, the core tasks of conducting interviews and making final hiring decisions would still require human involvement.

- E3: The task of recruiting and hiring staff members does not involve image processing or detailed visual information, so the image capabilities of the LLM are not relevant in this context.
