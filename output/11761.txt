1: In this task, the Appraisers and Assessors of Real Estate are required to photograph interiors and exteriors of properties to assist in estimating property value, substantiate findings, and complete appraisal reports. With access to the LLM, the appraiser could potentially use the model to assist in writing detailed descriptions of the properties based on the photographs taken. The LLM could help in generating accurate and detailed reports based on the visual information captured in the images. Additionally, the LLM could assist in providing insights or analysis based on the images and descriptions provided. However, the task primarily involves physical actions of taking photographs, which cannot be directly replaced by the LLM. While the LLM can assist in the subsequent analysis and report writing, it cannot directly capture the visual information needed for the task.
