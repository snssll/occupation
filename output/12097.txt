1: In this task, a physical therapist is responsible for planning and carrying out individually designed programs of physical treatment for patients. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be significantly aided by the use of the language model. The task involves designing and implementing personalized physical treatment programs, which require hands-on skills, physical assessments, and interactions with patients. While the LLM can provide general information on physical therapy techniques, it cannot physically carry out treatments or interact directly with patients. Therefore, the task does not align with the capabilities of the LLM, and there are no clear ways in which the model can reduce the time it takes to complete the task significantly.
