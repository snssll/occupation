1: In this task, the occupation of Bicycle Repairers involves selling bicycles and accessories. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete the task with high quality by at least half.

- E0: This task involves direct human interaction in selling bicycles and accessories. It requires physical presence, communication skills, and potentially negotiation with customers. The LLM cannot replace these aspects of the task.

- E1: The LLM could potentially assist in writing product descriptions, creating marketing materials, or responding to customer inquiries via written correspondence. However, the core task of selling bicycles and accessories heavily relies on in-person interactions, which the LLM cannot directly facilitate.

- E2: While the LLM could potentially help generate sales scripts, analyze customer data for trends, or provide product recommendations based on customer preferences, the task of selling bicycles and accessories is primarily hands-on and requires human interaction that the LLM alone cannot replicate.

- E3: The task does not involve image capabilities or require reading text from PDFs, so access to image capabilities would not significantly impact the completion of the task.
