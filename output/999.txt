1: In this task, the driver/sales worker is responsible for arranging merchandise displays or issuing sales promotion materials to customers. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes for a driver/sales worker to complete this task with equivalent quality. 

Given the nature of the task, which involves physical interaction with merchandise displays and customers, it is unlikely that the LLM alone can reduce the time it takes to complete the task. The task requires hands-on activities such as arranging physical displays and interacting with customers, which cannot be directly replaced by text-based interactions with the LLM. While the LLM could potentially assist in generating written sales promotion materials, the core aspects of the task involve physical actions that the LLM cannot perform.
