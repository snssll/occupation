1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of informing patrons of establishment specialties and features as a Host or Hostess in a restaurant, lounge, or coffee shop, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be aided by the use of a large language model (LLM).

- E1: Direct exposure - In this case, using an LLM directly through an interface like ChatGPT could significantly reduce the time it takes to inform patrons about establishment specialties and features. The LLM could help generate engaging and informative descriptions, provide suggestions for how to present the information, and even assist in crafting responses to specific questions patrons may have about the offerings.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While having access to an LLM alone may not cut the time in half for this task, it is conceivable that additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to streamline the process. For example, an application could be created that retrieves up-to-date information about the establishment's specialties and features from online sources and combines this with the LLM's capabilities to generate tailored responses for patrons.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities would not significantly impact the task of informing patrons about establishment specialties and features, as this task primarily involves verbal communication rather than visual content.

Considering the above points, the task of informing patrons of establishment specialties and features as a Host or Hostess in a restaurant, lounge, or coffee shop would likely fall under **E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications**.
