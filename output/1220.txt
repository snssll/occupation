- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time to complete the task, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to streamline the room assignment process further. This software could incorporate real-time data on student preferences, room availability, and other factors to optimize room assignments.
