1: Robotics Engineers are responsible for installing, calibrating, operating, and maintaining robots. This task involves technical knowledge, hands-on skills, and problem-solving abilities. While an LLM could potentially provide information on general robotics concepts, it cannot physically install, calibrate, operate, or maintain robots. These tasks require physical interaction with the robots, understanding of mechanical and electrical systems, and troubleshooting skills, which are beyond the capabilities of an LLM. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it cannot be significantly aided by the LLM.
