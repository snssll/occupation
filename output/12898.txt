1: In this task, a dermatologist is required to prescribe hormonal agents or topical treatments to treat various skin conditions. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves medical knowledge, understanding of skin conditions, and the ability to prescribe medications based on individual patient needs. While an LLM can provide general information about these treatments, it lacks the specialized medical expertise required to make accurate prescriptions tailored to specific patients. The task also involves patient-specific factors, medical history, allergies, and potential interactions with other medications, which are crucial considerations in dermatology. Therefore, the task cannot be effectively completed by an LLM alone, as it requires specialized medical training and expertise beyond what the model can provide.
