1: In this task, a dental hygienist is required to attend continuing education courses to maintain or update their skills. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes for a dental hygienist to complete this task. 

- E0: This task involves physical attendance at courses, which cannot be replaced by the LLM. The LLM cannot physically attend courses or interact with instructors in a way that would fulfill the requirements of continuing education.
- E1: The LLM could potentially assist in researching and summarizing information related to continuing education courses, providing insights into the latest trends or advancements in dental hygiene. However, the core task of attending courses cannot be directly completed by the LLM.
- E2: While the LLM could help in researching and summarizing course materials, it cannot attend courses on behalf of the dental hygienist. Additional software that could be developed on top of the LLM might help in organizing course information or providing personalized recommendations for courses based on the hygienist's interests and needs.
- E3: The task does not involve image capabilities, so exposure to LLM with image capabilities is not relevant for this task.

Based on the above analysis, the most appropriate exposure label for this task is E1.

2: E1

3: Moderate
