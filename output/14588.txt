1: In this task, the goal is to replace chemical insecticides with environmentally friendly practices, specifically by adding pest-repelling plants to fields. To complete this task, a worker would need to have knowledge of sustainable agriculture practices, types of pest-repelling plants, their benefits, and how to integrate them into existing farming operations. The worker would also need to understand the potential impact on crop yield, soil health, and overall farm sustainability. 

Given the complexity and specialized knowledge required for this task, the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task. While the LLM can provide information on sustainable agriculture practices and pest-repelling plants, the practical application and integration into a specific farming operation would require hands-on experience and domain expertise that the LLM may not fully capture. However, it is conceivable that additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to provide tailored recommendations based on specific farm conditions, crop types, and environmental factors, which could potentially reduce the time needed to implement such practices.
