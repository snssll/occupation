1: In this task, a lawyer is required to probate wills and represent and advise executors and administrators of estates. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- Probating wills involves legal processes, understanding complex legal documents, and providing legal advice based on specific circumstances. The task may involve interpreting legal language, understanding the legal implications of the will, and navigating the legal system to ensure the will is executed correctly.
- Representing and advising executors and administrators of estates requires knowledge of estate law, tax implications, and ensuring the proper distribution of assets according to the will or legal requirements. This may involve drafting legal documents, negotiating with other parties, and providing guidance on legal matters.

Given the complexity and specialized legal knowledge required for these tasks, it is unlikely that the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes for a lawyer to complete these tasks with high quality. While the LLM can provide general information and some legal insights, the specific legal expertise and experience needed for probating wills and advising on estate matters go beyond the capabilities of the LLM.
