1: In this task, a Set and Exhibit Designer is responsible for coordinating the removal of sets, props, and exhibits after productions or events are complete. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone or with additional software could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality.

- E0: This task involves physical coordination and likely requires on-site presence to oversee the removal process. The LLM and any software built on top of it cannot physically coordinate the removal of physical objects, making this task unsuitable for automation through LLM capabilities.
- E1: The task does not involve writing, transforming text, or providing feedback that could be easily automated by the LLM. It also does not involve data analysis, decision-making, or information retrieval that the LLM could assist with. Therefore, direct access to the LLM would not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task.
- E2: While it is conceivable that specialized software could be developed to assist with scheduling or logistics related to set and exhibit removal, the physical nature of the task and the need for on-site coordination make it challenging to automate using LLM-powered applications alone.
- E3: The task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images, so the image capabilities of the LLM are not relevant here.

Based on the above analysis, this task is best classified as E0.

2: E0

3: High
