1: In this task, the main responsibility is driving light trucks to transport materials to and from specified destinations. This task involves physical actions such as operating a vehicle, loading/unloading materials, and navigating roads. Since the task is primarily focused on physical actions and does not involve complex decision-making or information processing that could benefit significantly from an LLM, it is unlikely that access to an LLM would reduce the time it takes to complete the task with high quality by at least half. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of an LLM.

2: E0

3: High
