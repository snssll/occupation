1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of designing and developing blockchain technologies for industries such as finance and music as a Blockchain Engineer, we need to consider the level of exposure to LLM.

- E0: This task involves specialized knowledge and expertise in blockchain technology, which may not be significantly enhanced by the use of an LLM. The task requires hands-on technical skills and understanding of complex algorithms, which are not easily replaceable by text-based AI models.

- E1: While the LLM could potentially assist in providing general information or explanations related to blockchain technology, it is unlikely to significantly reduce the time or effort required to design and develop blockchain technologies for specific industries. The task involves practical implementation and problem-solving that goes beyond the capabilities of text-based AI models.

- E2: It is conceivable that additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to assist Blockchain Engineers in tasks such as summarizing research papers on blockchain, retrieving up-to-date information on industry trends, or providing recommendations based on data analysis. However, the core task of designing and developing blockchain technologies would still heavily rely on specialized knowledge and technical skills beyond what the LLM alone can offer.

- E3: The task does not involve image processing or visual data that would benefit from additional capabilities beyond text-based AI models. Therefore, exposure to image capabilities would not significantly impact the completion of this task.
