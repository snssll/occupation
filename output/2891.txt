1: In this task, an Electrical Engineer is required to conduct field surveys or study various data sources to identify and correct power system problems. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be significantly aided by the use of the language model. 

- The task involves analyzing data, maps, graphs, and diagrams to identify power system problems. An LLM could potentially assist in providing additional insights, explanations, or solutions based on the data provided.
- The LLM could help in generating reports, summarizing findings, or even suggesting potential solutions based on the information gathered during the field surveys.
- While the LLM may not directly reduce the time it takes to conduct field surveys, it can enhance the analysis process and provide valuable input for problem-solving.

Considering these points, the task could be classified as E2 - Exposure by LLM-powered applications. Although the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time to complete the task, additional software built on top of the LLM could streamline the data analysis process and provide valuable insights for correcting power system problems.
