1: In this task, the Hotel, Motel, and Resort Desk Clerks are responsible for transmitting and receiving messages using telephones or telephone switchboards. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves basic communication skills and does not require complex decision-making or specialized knowledge beyond operating a telephone system. The task is straightforward and does not involve in-depth analysis or creative input. Therefore, the task does not significantly benefit from the capabilities of an LLM, as it does not involve text transformation, complex instructions, specialized knowledge retrieval, or image processing. As such, this task falls under E0 as it does not clearly decrease the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete the task with high quality by at least half.
