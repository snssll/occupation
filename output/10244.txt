1: In this task, a Control and Valve Installer and Repairer is required to mount and install meters and other electric equipment using electricians' hand tools. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be significantly expedited or improved by using the language model. Since the task involves physical installation and manipulation of electric equipment, it does not directly involve text-based activities that the LLM excels at. The LLM cannot physically mount or install equipment, so it cannot directly assist in this task. Therefore, the task does not fall under E1, E2, or E3 exposure levels.

2: E0

3: High
