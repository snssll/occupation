1: In this task, a Chemical Plant and System Operator is required to turn valves to regulate the flow of products or byproducts through various tanks. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves physical manipulation of valves and monitoring the flow of substances in a chemical plant setting. This task does not involve text input or output, complex instructions, document analysis, or any form of communication that can be directly facilitated by an LLM. As such, the task does not align with the capabilities of the LLM, and there are no tools built on top of the LLM that could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this physical, hands-on task. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not benefit from LLM exposure.

2: E0
