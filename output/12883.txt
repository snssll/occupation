1: In this task, a Security Management Specialist is required to prepare, maintain, or update security procedures, security system drawings, or related documentation. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM can assist in completing it. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM can help in writing and transforming text, providing edits to existing documents, and maintaining records of written data. In this case, the LLM could assist in drafting security procedures, updating documentation, or even generating new security system drawings based on provided information. The LLM's text generation capabilities can significantly reduce the time needed to complete these tasks with equivalent quality.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone can assist in text-related tasks, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to summarize longer documents, retrieve up-to-date security information, or provide recommendations based on data. Such software could further enhance the efficiency of completing security-related tasks.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Since the task involves updating security system drawings, having access to image capabilities along with the LLM could be beneficial. The system could potentially assist in creating or editing digital images of security system drawings according to instructions, thereby reducing the time required for this aspect of the task.
