1: In this task, a general dentist is required to write prescriptions for antibiotics or other medications. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be facilitated by the LLM. 

- E0: This task involves a high degree of responsibility and legal implications as it involves prescribing medications to patients. The decision to prescribe antibiotics or other medications requires a thorough understanding of the patient's medical history, condition, and potential interactions with other medications. This task cannot be automated or delegated to an LLM due to the critical nature of healthcare decisions and the need for human expertise and judgment.

- E1: While the LLM could potentially provide information on general prescribing guidelines or drug interactions, the task of writing prescriptions for antibiotics or other medications involves complex medical knowledge, patient-specific considerations, and legal implications. The LLM alone cannot safely and effectively perform this task without the direct involvement of a qualified healthcare professional.

- E2: It is conceivable that software could be developed to assist dentists in prescribing medications by integrating the LLM's capabilities with patient-specific data, medical guidelines, and drug interaction databases. Such software could help streamline the prescription process by providing relevant information and suggestions to the dentist. However, due to the critical nature of prescribing medications, human oversight and final decision-making would still be necessary.

- E3: The task of writing prescriptions for antibiotics or other medications does not involve image processing capabilities that would significantly impact the completion time or quality of the task. Therefore, exposure to image capabilities does not apply in this context.
