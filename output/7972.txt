1: In this task, a Landscape Architect is required to inspect proposed sites to identify structural elements of land areas and other important site information. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it. 

- E0: This task involves physical inspection of sites, which cannot be directly replaced by the LLM. The LLM does not have the capability to physically inspect land areas, soil conditions, or existing landscaping. Therefore, this task does not fit into any of the exposure categories based on the given criteria.

2: E0

3: High
