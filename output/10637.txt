1: In this task, an Audio and Video Technician is responsible for obtaining, setting up, and loading videotapes for scheduled productions or broadcasts. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves physical actions such as handling videotapes, setting up equipment, and loading tapes, which cannot be directly performed by the LLM. While the LLM could potentially provide information on best practices for handling videotapes or troubleshooting common issues, it cannot physically carry out the task itself. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not involve text-based activities that the LLM can significantly assist with.

2: E0

3: High
