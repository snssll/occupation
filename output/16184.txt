1: In this task, the Railroad Brake, Signal, and Switch Operators and Locomotive Firers are required to start diesel engines to warm them before runs. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. Starting diesel engines is a physical task that involves interacting with machinery and equipment, which cannot be directly performed by an LLM. The task also requires practical knowledge of operating locomotives, which involves hands-on experience and understanding of safety protocols. Since the task involves physical actions and specialized knowledge beyond text-based information, it is unlikely that access to an LLM would significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task.
