1: In this task, a Postal Service Clerk receives letters and parcels and places mail into bags. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone or with additional software could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality.

- E0: This task involves physical handling of letters and parcels, which cannot be replaced by the LLM or any software. The task also does not involve complex decision-making or specialized knowledge that the LLM could assist with.

- E1: The task of receiving letters and parcels and placing mail into bags is a straightforward physical task that does not involve complex instructions, writing, or decision-making that the LLM could directly assist with. Therefore, direct access to the LLM would not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task.

- E2: While it is conceivable that software could be developed to automate some aspects of mail sorting or provide recommendations based on data analysis, the task itself is primarily physical and does not involve the type of information processing or decision-making that the LLM could enhance.

- E3: The task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images, so the image capabilities of the LLM are not relevant here.

2: E0

3: High
