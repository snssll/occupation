1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of testing software systems or applications for software enhancements or new products as a Data Warehousing Specialist, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be impacted by the use of the LLM.

- Data Warehousing Specialists typically work with large volumes of data and software systems to ensure data integrity, availability, and performance.
- Testing software systems involves running test cases, analyzing results, and ensuring that the software meets requirements.
- The task may involve writing test cases, documenting test results, and communicating with developers to resolve issues.

Given these considerations, the task of testing software systems for enhancements or new products can benefit from the use of the LLM in various ways:
- The LLM can assist in generating test cases based on requirements or specifications provided.
- It can help in analyzing test results and identifying patterns or anomalies in the data.
- The LLM can aid in documenting test procedures and results in a clear and concise manner.
- It can also support in communicating with developers by providing explanations or suggestions for resolving issues.

Considering the potential for the LLM to streamline the testing process, provide insights, and enhance communication in this task, the most appropriate label from the exposure rubric is E1.
