1: In this task, the Sales Representative is required to identify prospective customers through various means such as using business directories, following leads from existing clients, participating in organizations and clubs, and attending trade shows and conferences. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be significantly expedited or improved by using the language model. 

- The task involves a lot of human interaction and networking, which cannot be replaced by LLM.
- LLM may not have access to real-time data on potential customers or industry trends unless explicitly provided in the input.
- While LLM could potentially assist in generating leads or researching organizations and clubs, the effectiveness of this assistance may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task.

Considering these points, it is unlikely that the task of identifying prospective customers for Sales Representatives can be significantly expedited or improved by using the LLM. Therefore, this task falls under E0.
