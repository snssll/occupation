1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of shaping or cutting materials to specified measurements as a Carpenter, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves physical actions such as using hand tools, machines, or power saws to work with materials. Since the task is hands-on and requires physical manipulation of objects, it falls under the category of tasks that cannot be effectively completed by the LLM or any tools built on top of it. The LLM does not have the ability to perform physical tasks or interact with physical objects, making it unsuitable for tasks that involve manual labor.
