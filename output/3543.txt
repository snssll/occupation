1: In this task, a Loan Officer is responsible for contacting borrowers with delinquent accounts to obtain payment in full or negotiate repayment plans. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we can break down the task:
- The task involves communication with borrowers, which can be done through written correspondence (emails, letters) or spoken communication (phone calls).
- The task requires understanding the borrower's situation, negotiating payment terms, and potentially providing information on repayment options.
- The task may involve documenting the communication and agreements reached with borrowers.

Given that the task primarily involves written and spoken communication, the LLM could assist in drafting emails, letters, or scripts for phone calls. It could also help in formulating negotiation strategies and responses to borrower inquiries. The LLM could potentially save time by providing templates, suggested responses, or language to use in negotiations.
