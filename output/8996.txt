1: In this task, a Legal Secretary or Administrative Assistant is responsible for handling legal correspondence by mail, fax, or arranging delivery to various recipients. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could assist in completing it. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM could potentially assist in drafting legal correspondence, composing emails, or summarizing documents related to the correspondence. It could also help in organizing and maintaining records of the correspondence. However, the task specifically involves physical actions like mailing, faxing, or arranging delivery, which the LLM cannot perform directly.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time it takes to physically mail or fax correspondence, there could be additional software developed on top of the LLM that could streamline the process. For example, an application that automates the mailing process based on the information provided by the LLM could be developed.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities would not significantly impact the completion of this task as it primarily involves handling written correspondence rather than visual content.
