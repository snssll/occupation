1: In this task, a Low Vision Therapist, Orientation and Mobility Specialist, or Vision Rehabilitation Therapist is required to write reports or complete forms to document assessments, training, progress, or follow-up outcomes. With access to the powerful OpenAI large language model (LLM), the therapist could potentially use the model to assist in generating detailed and accurate reports based on the assessments conducted, training provided, progress observed, and follow-up outcomes. The LLM could help in structuring the reports, ensuring clarity, and providing relevant information. The therapist could input the key details, and the LLM could assist in expanding on those details, suggesting appropriate language, and ensuring the reports are comprehensive and well-written. This task involves writing and transforming text according to complex instructions, providing edits to existing text following specifications, and maintaining records of written data. The LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality by at least half.
