1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of selecting and obtaining materials and supplies, such as textbooks, for postsecondary teachers, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be impacted by the use of the LLM. 

- E1: If the task involves researching and identifying the most up-to-date textbooks or materials based on specific criteria provided by the teachers, the LLM could significantly reduce the time needed to gather this information. The LLM can quickly search for relevant textbooks, reviews, and availability, streamlining the selection process.

- E2: While the LLM alone may not reduce the time it takes to physically obtain the materials and supplies, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to automate the ordering process. This software could integrate with online platforms to place orders for textbooks based on the teachers' preferences, potentially saving time in the procurement phase.

- E3: Image capabilities are not relevant for this task as it primarily involves text-based information retrieval and procurement of physical materials, such as textbooks.
