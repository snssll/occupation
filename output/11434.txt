1: In this task, a paramedic is required to perform emergency invasive interventions before delivering a patient to an acute care facility. This task involves critical decision-making, medical knowledge, and hands-on skills that cannot be effectively replaced by an LLM. The task requires physical presence, immediate action, and real-time assessment of the patient's condition, which are beyond the capabilities of the LLM. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not involve text-based activities that can be significantly aided by the LLM.
