1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of developing and maintaining computerized record management systems for Medical and Health Services Managers, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves creating systems to store and process data, produce reports, and manage information efficiently. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM can assist in writing and transforming text and code according to complex instructions, which could be useful in developing the record management systems. It can help in generating code snippets, providing edits to existing code, and summarizing information related to data management systems.
- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time to complete the task, additional software built on top of the LLM could enhance the process. This software could include capabilities like analyzing data to inform decisions, making recommendations based on data input, and maintaining complex databases.
- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not relevant for this task as it primarily involves developing computerized record management systems and does not require image processing or creation.

Based on the above analysis, the task of developing and maintaining computerized record management systems for Medical and Health Services Managers aligns best with E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications.
