1: Pharmacy Technicians assist customers by answering simple questions, locating items, or referring them to the pharmacist for medication information. This task involves interacting with customers, providing basic information, and directing them to the pharmacist when needed. While an LLM could potentially assist in providing information on common medications or answering general questions, the task also requires human interaction and judgment, especially when referring customers to the pharmacist for more detailed medication information. The LLM may not have the real-time knowledge of specific medications or regulations that a pharmacy technician would need to accurately assist customers. Therefore, the task falls under E0 as it involves a high degree of human interaction and decision-making that cannot be fully replaced by an LLM.
