1: In this task, the occupation of Fence Erectors involves welding metal parts together using portable gas welding equipment. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone or with additional software could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality.

- E0: This task involves physical work that cannot be automated by the LLM or any software tools. Welding metal parts together requires manual dexterity, precision, and handling of equipment, which cannot be performed by the LLM.

- E1: The task of welding metal parts together is a hands-on activity that cannot be directly assisted by the LLM. While the LLM can provide information on welding techniques, safety procedures, or troubleshooting tips, it cannot physically weld metal parts together using portable gas welding equipment.

- E2: It is conceivable that additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to provide guidance on welding techniques, safety protocols, or troubleshooting tips. This software could potentially offer real-time assistance or augmented reality features to aid fence erectors in their welding tasks. However, the physical act of welding itself would still require human intervention.

- E3: The task of welding metal parts together does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images. Therefore, the image capabilities provided by the LLM would not significantly impact the completion of this task.
