1: In this task for Etchers and Engravers, the main activities involve preparing workpieces for etching or engraving through various processes like cutting, sanding, cleaning, polishing, and treating with different materials. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be significantly aided by the use of the language model. Since the task involves physical actions like cutting, sanding, and polishing, which cannot be directly assisted by text-based AI, it is unlikely that the LLM can reduce the time it takes to complete the task with high quality by at least half. The task is more hands-on and requires manual dexterity and physical manipulation of materials, which are not within the capabilities of the LLM.
