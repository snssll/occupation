1: In this task, a Metal-Refining Furnace Operator needs to draw smelted metal samples from furnaces or kettles for analysis and calculate the types and amounts of materials needed to ensure that materials meet specifications. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be significantly aided by the use of the language model. 

- Drawing smelted metal samples from furnaces requires physical interaction and cannot be automated by an LLM.
- Calculating types and amounts of materials needed involves technical knowledge and understanding of the materials being used, which may not be easily accessible through text-based information alone.

Given that the task involves physical actions and specialized technical knowledge beyond what an LLM can provide, it is unlikely that the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task.
