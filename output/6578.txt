1: In this task, an Animal Control Worker is required to examine animals for injuries or malnutrition and arrange for any necessary medical treatment. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- Animal examination for injuries or malnutrition involves physical inspection, which cannot be done by an LLM.
- Arranging for medical treatment requires practical actions such as contacting veterinarians, transporting animals, and ensuring proper care, which are beyond the capabilities of an LLM.

Given that the task involves physical examination and practical actions, it does not align with the capabilities of an LLM. Therefore, the task falls under E0 as it cannot be significantly aided by the LLM.

2: E0
