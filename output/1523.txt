1: Prosthodontists are dental specialists who focus on the restoration and replacement of teeth. One of the tasks they may perform is bleaching discolored teeth to brighten and whiten them. To determine the appropriate exposure label for this task in relation to the LLM, we need to consider the following:

- Bleaching discolored teeth involves a practical, hands-on procedure that requires direct interaction with patients and specialized dental equipment. This task cannot be completed solely through text-based instructions or information.
- The process of bleaching teeth requires precise measurements, careful application of bleaching agents, and consideration of the patient's oral health history and current condition. These aspects involve physical and practical skills that an LLM cannot perform.
- While an LLM could potentially provide general information on teeth bleaching procedures, it cannot replace the expertise, experience, and physical presence required by a prosthodontist to perform this task effectively and safely.

Based on these considerations, the task of bleaching discolored teeth to brighten and whiten them would be classified as E0 - No exposure to the LLM.
