1: In this task, an Educational, Guidance, and Career Counselor is required to attend meetings, conferences, workshops, and serve on committees. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task. The task involves physical presence, human interaction, and participation in real-time events, which cannot be replaced by the LLM. The LLM cannot attend meetings, conferences, or workshops on behalf of the counselor. Therefore, the task does not align with the capabilities of the LLM, and no exposure label applies.
