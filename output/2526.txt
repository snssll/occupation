1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of communicating with key stakeholders to determine project requirements and objectives as a Project Management Specialist, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM could help in drafting communication messages, summarizing stakeholder feedback, generating questions to ask stakeholders, or providing templates for communication. It could also assist in refining the language used to ensure clarity and effectiveness in communication.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time it takes to communicate with stakeholders, additional software could be developed to help summarize stakeholder feedback, analyze responses for trends, or provide recommendations based on stakeholder input.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities would not significantly impact the task of communicating with stakeholders to determine project requirements and objectives, as it primarily involves text-based communication.

Considering the task involves text-based communication with stakeholders, the most appropriate label seems to be E1: Direct exposure.

2: E1

3: Moderate
