1: In this task, a Labor Relations Specialist is responsible for scheduling or coordinating the details of grievance hearings or other meetings. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task and how an LLM could potentially assist in completing it more efficiently. 

- E1: Direct exposure - An LLM could assist in writing and transforming text related to scheduling details, providing edits to meeting coordination instructions, or generating emails to confirm meeting arrangements. The LLM could also help in summarizing relevant documents or providing feedback on meeting schedules. Therefore, the LLM could significantly reduce the time needed to complete this task with equivalent quality by at least half.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While an LLM alone may not reduce the time to complete the task by half, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to automate the scheduling process, retrieve up-to-date information on meeting availability, or analyze data to optimize meeting coordination. This additional software could enhance the efficiency of the task.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities would not significantly impact the completion of this task as it primarily involves text-based coordination of meetings and grievance hearings. Therefore, image capabilities are not relevant in this context.
