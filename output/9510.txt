1: In this task, a sheet metal worker is required to maneuver completed roofing units into position for installation. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone or with additional software could significantly reduce the time it takes for a sheet metal worker to complete this task with high quality.

- The task involves physical labor and hands-on work that cannot be directly replaced by text-based instructions or responses from the LLM.
- The task requires physical coordination, strength, and spatial awareness, which are not capabilities of the LLM.
- While the LLM could potentially provide information on best practices for maneuvering roofing units, it cannot physically perform the task or provide real-time guidance.

Based on these considerations, it is clear that the task of maneuvering completed roofing units into position for installation does not have a clear reduction in time or improvement in quality by utilizing the LLM or any software built on top of it. Therefore, this task falls under label E0.

2: E0

3: High
