1: In this task, the Automotive Service Technicians and Mechanics are required to repair or rebuild transmissions. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete the task with high quality by at least half.

Repairing or rebuilding transmissions involves hands-on work, precise measurements, and mechanical skills that cannot be replaced by text-based instructions or information provided by the LLM. The task requires physical interaction with the vehicle and specialized tools that the LLM cannot operate. Therefore, the LLM cannot directly assist in completing this task.
