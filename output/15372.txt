1: In this task, a taper is responsible for sealing joints between plasterboard or wallboard to prepare surfaces for painting or papering. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. Since the task involves manual work such as sealing joints physically, it does not involve text input or output that can be directly processed by an LLM. The task also requires physical interaction with materials and surfaces, which cannot be replaced by the capabilities of an LLM. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM or any tools built on top of it.

2: E0
