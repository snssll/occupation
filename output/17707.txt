1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of "Wash dishes and clean kitchens, cooking utensils, and silverware" for Maids and Housekeeping Cleaners, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves manual labor and physical cleaning, which cannot be directly automated by the LLM.
