1: In this task, an Obstetrician and Gynecologist or a General Internal Medicine Physician would need to conduct research to develop or test medications, treatments, or procedures to prevent or control disease or injury. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we can break down the task as follows:

- Researching existing literature and studies related to medications, treatments, and procedures.
- Analyzing and synthesizing information to identify gaps in current knowledge.
- Designing experiments or clinical trials to test new medications, treatments, or procedures.
- Collecting and analyzing data from experiments or trials.
- Interpreting results and drawing conclusions based on the data.

Given the complexity and specialized nature of this task, it is unlikely that direct access to the LLM alone would significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task by at least half. While the LLM could assist in providing some background information or generating initial ideas, the bulk of the work involves highly specialized medical knowledge, experimental design, and data analysis that go beyond the capabilities of the LLM.
