1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of estimating costs associated with operations in the Wind Energy Operations Managers occupation, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM can assist in completing it. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM can help in writing and transforming text related to cost estimation, providing edits to existing cost estimates, or even generating potential cost scenarios based on input data. It can also assist in summarizing cost reports or providing feedback on cost estimates.
- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time to estimate costs, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to analyze cost data, make recommendations based on historical data, or retrieve industry-specific cost information to enhance the accuracy of the estimates.
- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not relevant for this task as it primarily involves text-based cost estimation and does not require image analysis.
