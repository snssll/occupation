1: In this task, the Wind Turbine Service Technicians are responsible for assisting in the assembly of individual wind generators or the construction of wind farms. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves physical work related to the assembly and construction of wind turbines, which requires hands-on skills, knowledge of mechanical systems, and safety protocols. This task does not involve text-based or data-driven activities that could be significantly enhanced by the use of an LLM. The task is primarily practical and physical in nature, and the expertise required is not related to text generation, analysis, or decision-making based on written information. Therefore, the task does not align with any of the exposure labels related to LLM capabilities.
