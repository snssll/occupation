The LLM could help in drafting job descriptions, screening resumes, generating interview questions, providing guidance on best practices for interviews, and even drafting rejection or acceptance emails. The model could also assist in researching industry trends or best practices in security personnel recruitment. However, the task of recruiting, interviewing, and hiring involves a significant amount of human interaction, judgment, and decision-making that may not be easily automated by the LLM.
