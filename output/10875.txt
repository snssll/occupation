1: In this task, the Service Unit Operators in the Oil and Gas industry are required to operate pumps to circulate fluids through wells. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if the task can be significantly expedited or improved by using the LLM. The task involves physical operations related to oil and gas extraction, which cannot be directly assisted by the LLM. The task does not involve text input or output, complex instructions, document analysis, or any other form of information processing that the LLM excels at. Therefore, the task does not fall under E1, E2, or E3 categories.

2: E0

3: High
