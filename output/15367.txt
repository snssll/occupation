1: In this task, the Surgical Technologists are responsible for scrubbing their arms and hands and assisting the surgical team in preparing for surgery by putting on gloves, masks, and surgical clothing. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM could significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced Surgical Technologist to complete this task with high quality. 

Given the nature of the task, which involves physical actions such as scrubbing arms and hands and putting on protective gear, it is clear that the LLM cannot directly assist in these physical aspects. The task does not involve complex decision-making, data analysis, writing, or any other activity that could be significantly expedited by the LLM. Therefore, the task does not fall under E1, E2, or E3 categories.

2: E0
