1: In this task of operating towed machines for agricultural purposes, the main actions involve planting, fertilizing, dusting, and spraying crops using equipment like seed drills and manure spreaders. These actions require physical operation of machinery in the field, which cannot be directly assisted by an LLM. The task involves hands-on work that is not text-based and does not involve complex decision-making that can be automated by the LLM. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM or any tools built on top of it.
