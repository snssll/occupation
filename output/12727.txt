1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of preparing reports or making presentations on internal investigations, losses, or violations of regulations, policies, and procedures as a Security Manager, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves writing detailed reports based on investigations and violations, which can benefit from the LLM's ability to generate text based on complex instructions. The LLM can assist in summarizing information, providing feedback on documents, and maintaining records of written data. However, since the task may require specialized knowledge of security protocols, regulations, and procedures, the LLM alone may not have the domain-specific expertise to fully complete the task efficiently. Therefore, additional software that could be developed on top of the LLM to provide recommendations based on data analysis or specialized security knowledge could potentially reduce the time it takes to complete the task by half.
