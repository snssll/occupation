1: In this task of matching statements with batches of canceled checks by account numbers, the main activities involve comparing and cross-referencing information. The task does not require specialized domain knowledge beyond basic accounting principles and procedures. The task is primarily text-based, focusing on account numbers and statements. An LLM could potentially assist in automating the matching process by quickly scanning and comparing the text-based information provided. The LLM could help in identifying patterns, discrepancies, or similarities between the statements and canceled checks, thus expediting the matching process.

Considering the nature of the task and the potential for the LLM to streamline the comparison and matching process significantly, I would classify this task as E1 - Direct exposure.

2: E1
