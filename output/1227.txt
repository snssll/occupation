1: In this task, a First-Line Supervisor of Farming, Fishing, and Forestry Workers is responsible for assigning tasks related to the care of animals and maintenance of animal quarters. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if the task can be significantly expedited or improved by using the LLM. The LLM could potentially assist in generating task assignment instructions, providing information on best practices for animal care, or even suggesting efficient cleaning and maintenance schedules. However, the task itself involves physical activities such as feeding animals and cleaning quarters, which cannot be directly performed by the LLM. While the LLM could provide written instructions or guidelines, the actual execution of the tasks would still require human intervention. Therefore, the task does not fall under E1 as it cannot be fully completed by the LLM alone. Additionally, developing software on top of the LLM to automate these physical tasks is not feasible. The LLM does not have the capability to interact with physical environments or perform hands-on tasks. Hence, the task does not align with E2 either. Since the task does not involve any text-based analysis or decision-making that could benefit from image capabilities, it also does not fit under E3. Therefore, the most appropriate label for this task is E0.

2: E0

3: High
