1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of reviewing and revising sustainability proposals or policies as a Sustainability Specialist, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The task involves reviewing and revising text-based documents (sustainability proposals or policies), which aligns well with the LLM's capabilities of processing and generating text. The LLM can help in providing insights, suggestions, and edits to improve the clarity, effectiveness, and sustainability impact of the proposals or policies. Therefore, direct access to the LLM could significantly reduce the time it takes to review and revise these documents with equivalent quality.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the task could potentially benefit from additional software that could summarize longer documents, retrieve up-to-date sustainability data, or provide recommendations based on data, the core task of reviewing and revising sustainability proposals or policies can still be effectively accomplished with direct access to the LLM. Therefore, the task does not necessarily require additional software beyond the LLM itself.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Since the task primarily involves reviewing and revising text-based sustainability proposals or policies, and does not require detailed image analysis or creation, the image capabilities of the LLM are not essential for completing this task.
