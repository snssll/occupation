1: In this task, the meat, poultry, and fish cutters and trimmers are required to separate meats and byproducts into specified containers and seal them. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. This task involves physical actions such as handling meat, separating items, and sealing containers, which cannot be directly performed by an LLM. The task does not involve complex decision-making, analysis, or writing that could be significantly aided by an LLM. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM or any tools built on top of it.
