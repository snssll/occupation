1: In this task, a First-Line Supervisor of Construction Trades and Extraction Workers is required to provide assistance to workers engaged in construction or extraction activities using hand tools or other equipment. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality. Since this task involves physical activities such as using hand tools and equipment, it cannot be directly completed using the LLM. The LLM cannot perform physical tasks or interact with physical tools. Therefore, the task does not fall under E1, E2, or E3 categories as the LLM cannot assist in completing the task.

2: E0
