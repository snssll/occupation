1: In this task, the fast food cook is responsible for serving orders to customers at various locations within the restaurant. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. Serving orders involves physical interaction with customers, handling food items, and navigating the restaurant environment. These aspects require human presence and physical actions, which cannot be replaced by an LLM. Additionally, the task does not involve complex data analysis, decision-making, or specialized knowledge that would benefit significantly from LLM capabilities. Therefore, the task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM.
