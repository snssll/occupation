1: In this task, the veterinary assistant or laboratory animal caretaker is required to exercise animals or provide them with companionship. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves physical interaction with animals, which cannot be replaced by text-based interactions with an LLM. The task also requires a level of empathy and understanding of animal behavior, which an LLM cannot provide. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it cannot be significantly aided by the use of an LLM.
