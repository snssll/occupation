1: In this task, the occupation involves affixing postage to packages or letters by hand or using postage meters. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if the task can be significantly expedited or improved by using the LLM. Since this task is very manual and physical in nature, involving the physical act of affixing postage, it does not seem like the LLM can directly assist in completing the task more efficiently. The LLM cannot physically affix postage or interact with postage meters. Therefore, it is unlikely that the LLM or any tool built on top of it can reduce the time it takes to complete this task significantly.
