1: In this task, a Speech-Language Pathology Assistant is required to select or prepare speech-language instructional materials. With access to the powerful OpenAI large language model (LLM), the assistant can easily generate a wide range of speech-language instructional materials tailored to specific needs. The LLM can help in creating worksheets, exercises, lesson plans, and other instructional materials by providing text output based on the input criteria. The assistant can input details such as target age group, language goals, specific speech or language disorders, and desired activities, and the LLM can generate relevant materials. This process can significantly reduce the time it takes to create instructional materials compared to doing it manually.

Considering the task involves writing and transforming text according to specific instructions, the LLM can streamline the process by providing ready-made content or generating content based on input criteria. This task falls under the E1 category as direct access to the LLM can reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality by at least half.
