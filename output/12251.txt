1: In this task, a welder, cutter, solderer, or brazer is required to preheat workpieces before welding or bending using torches or heating furnaces. This task involves physical actions such as operating torches or heating furnaces, monitoring temperatures, and ensuring the workpieces reach the required temperature for welding or bending. Since this task is hands-on and involves physical manipulation of equipment and materials, it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM or any tools built on top of it. The task requires practical skills, knowledge of materials, and experience in working with metal, which cannot be substituted by text-based AI models. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not benefit from exposure to the LLM.
