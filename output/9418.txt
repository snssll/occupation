1: In this task, a Robotics Technician is required to make repairs to robots or peripheral equipment by replacing defective circuit boards, sensors, controllers, encoders, or servomotors. This task involves hands-on technical skills, knowledge of robotics systems, and the ability to troubleshoot and repair physical components. The task does not involve writing or transforming text, providing edits, summarizing documents, or any other text-based activities that could be directly assisted by an LLM. Additionally, the task requires physical interaction with the robots and equipment, which cannot be performed by an LLM. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM or any software that could be developed on top of it.
