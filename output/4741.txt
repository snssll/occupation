1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of developing and documenting standard and emergency operating procedures for transportation, storage, and distribution managers, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves writing detailed procedures for various aspects of product handling and logistics, which can be complex and require specific knowledge in the field of transportation and logistics.

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM can assist in writing and transforming text according to complex instructions. It can help in drafting detailed operating procedures based on the input provided. The model can generate text based on the information given about standard and emergency operating procedures for transportation and logistics.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not reduce the time significantly for this task, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to streamline the process. This software could potentially summarize existing procedures, retrieve up-to-date regulations or best practices, and provide recommendations based on the input provided.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not relevant for this task as it primarily involves writing and documenting procedures rather than dealing with visual content.
