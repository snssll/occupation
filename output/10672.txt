1: In this task, an Electrical Power-Line Installer and Repairer is required to open switches or attach grounding devices to remove electrical hazards from disturbed or fallen lines or to facilitate repairs. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. This task involves specific technical knowledge and skills related to electrical systems and safety procedures. While the LLM can provide general information about electrical systems and safety protocols, it may not have the specialized knowledge required to perform the task effectively. The task also involves physical actions such as opening switches and attaching grounding devices, which cannot be directly performed by the LLM. Therefore, the task does not fall under E1 as it cannot be completed solely by writing or transforming text. Additionally, developing software on top of the LLM to reduce the time it takes to complete this task by half would be challenging due to the physical and specialized nature of the work. The task does not involve detailed measurements or visuals that would benefit from image capabilities. Hence, it does not fall under E3. Considering these factors, the task is best classified as E0 as it does not clearly benefit from LLM exposure in reducing the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete the task.
