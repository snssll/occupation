1: In this task, a Speech-Language Pathologist is required to complete administrative responsibilities such as coordinating paperwork, scheduling case management activities, or writing lesson plans. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- Writing lesson plans may involve generating text based on specific requirements and guidelines. This task can be effectively completed using the LLM, which can assist in drafting detailed lesson plans tailored to the needs of the students.
- Coordinating paperwork and scheduling case management activities involve organizing information and managing schedules. While the LLM can help in generating text-based content related to these activities, it may not significantly reduce the time required for coordination and scheduling, as these tasks involve more logistical considerations beyond text generation.

Considering the above points, this task involves a mix of text generation and organizational skills. While the LLM can assist in generating text-based content for lesson plans, it may not provide a substantial advantage in coordinating paperwork and scheduling activities. Therefore, this task falls under label E2 - Exposure by LLM-powered applications.

2: E2

3: Moderate
