1: In this task, a Sound Engineering Technician is responsible for separating instruments, vocals, and other sounds, as well as combining sounds during the mixing or postproduction stage. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The LLM can assist in providing information on sound engineering techniques, explaining the process of separating and combining sounds, and offering general advice on mixing and postproduction. However, the LLM lacks the ability to physically manipulate audio files or directly engage in the technical aspects of sound engineering tasks. While the LLM can provide theoretical knowledge and suggestions, it cannot directly perform the practical tasks involved in sound engineering.
