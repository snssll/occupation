1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of identifying, monitoring, or treating pregnancy-related problems as a midwife, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves medical knowledge and expertise in diagnosing and managing pregnancy complications, which typically require specialized training and experience. The LLM, while powerful in processing text data and providing information, does not have the ability to make medical diagnoses or provide treatment recommendations based on real-time patient data. The task also involves hands-on patient care and interaction, which cannot be performed by the LLM. Therefore, the task falls under E0 as it does not clearly decrease the time it takes for an experienced midwife to complete the task with high quality by at least half.
