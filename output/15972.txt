1: In this task, the Railroad Brake, Signal, and Switch Operators and Locomotive Firers need to signal other workers to set brakes and throw track switches when switching cars from trains to way stations. This task involves communication and coordination between workers to ensure the safe and efficient movement of trains. To complete this task, the LLM could potentially assist in generating standardized communication scripts or protocols for signaling, providing guidance on best practices for brake setting and track switching, or even creating training materials for new workers on signaling procedures. However, the task primarily involves physical actions and real-time coordination, which may not be easily replaced by text-based instructions or guidance from the LLM. Therefore, the exposure to LLM for this task would likely be classified as E0, as the LLM alone would not significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete the task with high quality.

2: E0
