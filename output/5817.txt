1: In this task, a Web Administrator is required to document installation or configuration procedures for web systems to ensure maintenance and repeatability. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM can assist in completing it. 

- The task involves writing detailed instructions for installation and configuration procedures, which can be effectively completed using the LLM's text generation capabilities.
- The LLM can help in structuring the documentation, providing clear and concise steps, and ensuring that the information is comprehensive.
- The LLM can also assist in generating examples, troubleshooting steps, and best practices to include in the documentation.
- While the task does not involve complex decision-making or specialized domain knowledge, the LLM's ability to generate text and provide guidance significantly reduces the time and effort required to create detailed documentation.

Based on these considerations, the task of documenting installation or configuration procedures for web systems aligns best with the E1 exposure label, as direct access to the LLM can reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality by at least half.
