1: In this task, a Financial Manager is responsible for direct insurance negotiations, selecting insurance brokers or carriers, and placing insurance. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes for a Financial Manager to complete this task with equivalent quality. 

- Direct exposure (E1): The task involves negotiating insurance contracts, selecting brokers, and placing insurance, which requires a deep understanding of financial and insurance concepts, regulations, and market trends. While the LLM can provide general information on these topics, it may not have the specialized knowledge required for direct insurance negotiations. Therefore, the LLM alone may not be able to reduce the time significantly for a Financial Manager to complete this task.

- Exposure by LLM-powered applications (E2): It is conceivable that additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to assist Financial Managers in analyzing insurance policies, market trends, and broker performance, which could potentially reduce the time needed to make informed decisions during insurance negotiations. This additional software could leverage the LLM's capabilities to provide recommendations and analyze complex insurance data.

- Exposure given image capabilities (E3): Image capabilities would not significantly impact the task of direct insurance negotiations, broker selection, and insurance placement. This task primarily involves textual information and decision-making based on financial and insurance knowledge, which does not heavily rely on image processing.

Considering the above points, the task of direct insurance negotiations, selecting insurance brokers or carriers, and placing insurance aligns best with Exposure by LLM-powered applications (E2).
