1: In this task, the Outdoor Power Equipment and Other Small Engine Mechanics are required to dismantle engines using hand tools and examine parts for defects. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. Since the task involves physical actions such as dismantling engines using hand tools, it does not directly involve text input or output that can be processed by the LLM. The LLM cannot physically dismantle engines or examine parts for defects. Therefore, the task does not fall under E1, E2, or E3 exposure labels as it does not involve text-based interactions or image processing that can be enhanced by the LLM.

2: E0

3: High
