1: In this task, an orthodontist examines patients to assess abnormalities of jaw development, tooth position, and other dental-facial structures. This task involves physical examination and assessment of patients, which cannot be directly performed by an LLM. The LLM does not have the capability to physically examine patients or assess their dental-facial structures. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not involve text-based or image-based tasks that can be completed by the LLM.
