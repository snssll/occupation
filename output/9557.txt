1: In this task, a Stocker or Order Filler is responsible for marking stock items with identification tags, stamps, or labeling equipment. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves straightforward instructions and does not require complex decision-making or specialized knowledge beyond basic labeling procedures. The task primarily involves manual labor and does not involve text input or output that would benefit significantly from the capabilities of an LLM. Therefore, the task does not align with any of the exposure levels that involve text input, transformation, or analysis. As such, the task falls under E0 as it does not benefit from LLM capabilities to reduce the time it takes to complete the task.
