1: In this task, a commercial diver is required to remove obstructions from strainers or marine railway or launching ways using pneumatic or power hand tools. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves physical work underwater, which cannot be directly assisted by an LLM. The task requires manual dexterity, physical strength, and the ability to work in challenging underwater conditions. Since the task involves physical actions and does not primarily rely on text-based or data-driven decision-making, it does not align with the capabilities of an LLM. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not benefit from LLM assistance.

2: E0

3: High
