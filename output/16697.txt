1: In this task, an Ophthalmic Medical Technologist is required to take anatomical or functional ocular measurements, such as axial length measurements, of the eye or surrounding tissue. This task involves precise measurements of the eye, which cannot be performed by an LLM or any system powered by it. The task requires physical interaction with the patient, specialized equipment, and expertise in handling the instruments accurately. Since the task involves hands-on work that requires physical presence and precise measurements, it cannot be effectively completed by an LLM or any tool built on top of it. Therefore, this task falls under the E0 category as it does not benefit from LLM exposure.
