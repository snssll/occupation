1: For the task of disassembling and reassembling broken equipment, the exposure to LLM can be evaluated as follows:

- E1: Direct access to the LLM could potentially reduce the time it takes to complete this task by providing step-by-step instructions on how to disassemble and reassemble specific types of equipment. The LLM could generate detailed guides or troubleshoot common issues, making the process more efficient.
- E2: While having access to the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time to complete the task, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to create interactive tutorials or virtual simulations for disassembling and reassembling equipment, which could enhance the efficiency of the process.
- E3: Image capabilities would not significantly impact the task of disassembling and reassembling equipment, as it primarily involves manual actions rather than visual or image-related tasks.

Based on the above analysis, the task of disassembling and reassembling broken equipment aligns best with label E2, as additional software could be developed to enhance the efficiency of the process.
