1: In this task, a massage therapist is required to prepare and blend oils before applying them to clients' skin. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone or with additional software could significantly reduce the time it takes for a massage therapist to complete this task with equivalent quality.

- Direct exposure (E1): The task of preparing and blending oils involves physical actions such as measuring, mixing, and applying the blends to clients' skin. While the LLM could potentially provide information on different types of oils and their benefits, it cannot physically prepare or blend oils. Therefore, direct access to the LLM would not reduce the time it takes to complete this task significantly.

- Exposure by LLM-powered applications (E2): It is conceivable that an application could be developed on top of the LLM that provides recommendations for oil blends based on client preferences or skin conditions. This application could suggest blends, their benefits, and potential contraindications, thereby streamlining the decision-making process for the massage therapist. However, the physical act of preparing and blending oils would still need to be done manually.

- Exposure given image capabilities (E3): Image capabilities would not significantly impact the task of preparing and blending oils and applying them to clients' skin. This task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images.

Based on the above analysis, the task of preparing and blending oils and applying them to clients' skin would best fit under Exposure by LLM-powered applications (E2).
