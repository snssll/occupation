1: In this task, the Stationary Engineers and Boiler Operators are required to operate and maintain stationary engines, boilers, and auxiliary equipment to supply steam or heat for various purposes. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be significantly enhanced or automated by using the language model. Since the task involves physical operation and maintenance of machinery, it does not directly involve text-based activities that can be easily automated by an LLM. The task requires hands-on skills and technical knowledge that cannot be substituted by text-based AI tools. Therefore, the task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM.

2: E0

3: High
