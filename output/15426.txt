1: In this task, a Food Scientist or Technologist is required to seek substitutes for harmful or undesirable additives, such as nitrites. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- Seeking substitutes for harmful additives involves a significant amount of research, analysis, and knowledge in the field of food science.
- The task requires understanding the properties of different additives, their effects on food products, and potential alternatives that can achieve similar results.
- The process may involve reviewing scientific literature, conducting experiments, and consulting with other experts in the field.
- While an LLM can provide general information on food additives and potential substitutes, the task of identifying specific substitutes for harmful additives like nitrites requires specialized domain knowledge and expertise.

Based on these considerations, the task of seeking substitutes for harmful or undesirable additives, such as nitrites, falls under E2 - Exposure by LLM-powered applications. While the LLM can provide some general information and insights, developing specialized software on top of the LLM that can analyze scientific literature, recommend alternatives, and provide detailed explanations would significantly enhance the efficiency of completing this task.
