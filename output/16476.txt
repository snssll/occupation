1: In this task, the healthcare social worker is responsible for supervising and directing other workers providing services to clients or patients. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality. The LLM could potentially assist in generating guidelines, protocols, or training materials for the workers being supervised. It could also help in drafting reports, documenting progress, or communicating with the team. However, the task of supervising and directing other workers involves a high degree of human interaction, decision-making, and real-time assessment of situations, which may not be effectively replaced by the LLM alone. Therefore, the task does not seem to fit into categories E1, E2, or E3.

2: E0

3: Moderate
