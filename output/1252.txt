1: In this task, a cashier is required to assist customers by providing information and resolving their complaints. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we can break down the task:
- Providing information: The LLM can assist in generating responses to common customer inquiries or providing information based on general knowledge.
- Resolving complaints: The LLM can help in drafting responses to common complaints or providing suggestions on how to address certain issues.

Considering the nature of the task, the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to draft responses or suggestions for customer inquiries and complaints. While the LLM cannot directly interact with customers, it can assist in preparing written responses that can be used by cashiers to address customer needs.
