1: In this task, a Cooling and Freezing Equipment Operator and Tender is required to inspect and maintain equipment by flushing lines with solutions or steam and spraying equipment with sterilizing solutions. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. This task involves routine maintenance activities that are primarily manual and hands-on in nature. While the task description does involve some written instructions, the core of the task revolves around physical actions such as inspecting, flushing, and spraying equipment. These actions cannot be directly performed by an LLM or any software tool based on it. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not involve text-based activities that can be significantly expedited or enhanced by the LLM.
