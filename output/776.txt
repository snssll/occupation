1: In this task, the occupation is Hairdressers, Hairstylists, and Cosmetologists, and the specific task is to apply artificial fingernails. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone or with additional software could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality.

Hairdressers, Hairstylists, and Cosmetologists typically require hands-on skills and precision when applying artificial fingernails. This task involves physical dexterity, attention to detail, and an understanding of nail care techniques. Since this task is hands-on and requires practical skills, it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM or any software built on top of it. The LLM cannot physically apply artificial fingernails, and there are no virtual tools that can accurately replicate this task.
