1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of conducting audits of validation or performance qualification processes as a Validation Engineer, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be impacted by the use of the LLM.

- The task involves reviewing processes and ensuring compliance with internal or regulatory requirements. This task primarily involves understanding and applying specific guidelines, regulations, and standards.
- The LLM can assist in providing information on regulations and standards, helping in the interpretation of complex requirements, and potentially generating reports or summaries based on the input data.
- While the LLM can provide information and assist in documentation, the task of conducting audits may require practical knowledge, experience, and judgment that go beyond text-based information retrieval.

Based on these considerations, the task of conducting audits of validation or performance qualification processes as a Validation Engineer could be classified as E2. While the LLM can provide valuable information and support in understanding regulations and standards, the task itself may require specialized domain knowledge, practical experience, and judgment that cannot be fully replaced by text-based assistance.
