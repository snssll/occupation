1: In this task, a faller works as a member of a team, rotating between chain saw operation and skidder operation. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider whether access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality. 

- The task involves physical operations with machinery, such as operating a chainsaw and skidder, which cannot be directly assisted by the LLM.
- The task requires practical skills and hands-on experience in operating equipment safely and effectively, which the LLM cannot provide.
- The task does not involve text-based or knowledge-based work that can be easily automated or assisted by the LLM.

Based on these considerations, it is clear that the task of working as a faller, rotating between chain saw operation and skidder operation, does not have exposure to LLM capabilities. Therefore, the appropriate label for this task is E0.

2: E0

3: High
