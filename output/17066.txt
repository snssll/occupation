1: In this task, a Traffic Technician is required to time stoplights or other delays using stopwatches. This task involves physical actions such as operating stopwatches and observing traffic signals in real-time. The task does not involve writing, transforming text, providing edits, summarizing documents, or any other text-based activities that an LLM could directly assist with. Additionally, this task does not involve analyzing text, providing recommendations, or maintaining databases that could potentially be automated with additional software built on top of an LLM. Since the task is entirely physical and observational in nature, it does not align with any of the exposure levels in the rubric.
