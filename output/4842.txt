1: In this task, a fundraiser is responsible for developing corporate fundraising programs, such as employer gift-matching. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it. 

- E0: This task involves developing fundraising programs, which requires a high level of human interaction, creativity, and strategic planning. The task may involve understanding the specific needs and goals of the organization, building relationships with corporate partners, and tailoring fundraising programs to align with their interests. The LLM may not significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced fundraiser to complete this task, as it requires a deep understanding of the organization's mission, values, and donor relationships.

- E1: The LLM could potentially assist in providing templates or examples of successful corporate fundraising programs, which could serve as a starting point for the fundraiser. It could also help in drafting persuasive communication materials or proposals to present to potential corporate partners. However, the task of developing customized fundraising programs tailored to specific corporate partners may still require significant human input and expertise.

- E2: While the LLM alone may not reduce the time it takes to develop corporate fundraising programs by half, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to analyze data on corporate giving trends, identify potential corporate partners, and generate recommendations for effective fundraising strategies. This software could leverage the LLM's capabilities to provide insights and recommendations based on a vast amount of data and information.

- E3: The task of developing corporate fundraising programs does not involve image capabilities, so this label does not apply to this task.
