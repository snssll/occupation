1: In this task, a First-Line Supervisor of Retail Sales Workers is responsible for establishing and implementing policies, goals, objectives, and procedures for the department. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it. 

- E0: This task involves setting policies and procedures which require a high level of human judgment, understanding of the specific retail environment, and organizational dynamics. The task does not involve direct text-based inputs or outputs that could be easily automated by the LLM. The LLM cannot make decisions that might impact human livelihood, and setting policies typically involves a level of decision-making that goes beyond what the LLM can provide.

- E1: While the LLM could potentially assist in generating initial drafts of policies or providing general information on best practices, the task of establishing and implementing policies for a retail department is complex and requires domain-specific knowledge, experience, and human judgment. The LLM alone cannot significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality by at least half.

- E2: It is conceivable that additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to help organize and summarize existing policies and procedures, provide recommendations based on data analysis, or retrieve specialized domain knowledge related to retail management. However, the task of establishing and implementing policies for a retail department still heavily relies on human expertise and decision-making, which the LLM alone cannot fully automate.

- E3: The task does not involve image capabilities, so exposure to LLM with image capabilities is not relevant in this context.
