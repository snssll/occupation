1: In this task of purchasing, renting, or requisitioning costumes or wardrobe necessities, the main activities involve selecting appropriate costumes based on the production requirements, budget constraints, and artistic vision. The task may also involve coordinating with vendors, negotiating prices, and ensuring timely delivery of the costumes. 

For this task, the exposure to LLM would likely fall under E0. This is because the task involves a high degree of human interaction, negotiation, and decision-making based on various factors such as budget, artistic vision, and production requirements. While the LLM could potentially assist in providing information on costume trends, pricing, or vendor options, the final decision-making process, negotiation, and coordination aspects heavily rely on human judgment and interaction.
