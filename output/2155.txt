1: In this task, the occupation is Skincare Specialists, and the task involves cleansing clients' skin with water, creams, or lotions. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM would significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced skincare specialist to complete the task with high quality.

- E0: This task involves physical interaction with clients, which cannot be replaced by text-based tools like the LLM. Skincare specialists need to physically cleanse clients' skin, which cannot be done through text-based instructions alone.

- E1: The task of cleansing clients' skin involves physical actions that cannot be directly replaced by text-based instructions from the LLM. While the LLM could potentially provide information on skincare products or techniques, the actual cleansing process requires physical interaction.

- E2: While the LLM could potentially provide information on skincare products, techniques, or recommendations based on general knowledge, it cannot directly perform the task of cleansing clients' skin. However, it is conceivable that software could be developed to provide personalized skincare recommendations based on client information, which could complement the work of skincare specialists.

- E3: The task of cleansing clients' skin does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images. Therefore, image capabilities would not significantly impact the completion of this task.
