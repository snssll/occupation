1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of studying mutations in organisms that lead to cancer or other diseases as a Biochemist or Biophysicist, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The task involves studying mutations in organisms, which requires a deep understanding of biochemistry and biophysics. While the LLM can provide information and context on mutations and diseases, it may not have the specialized knowledge and expertise required to conduct the actual research and analysis in this field. Therefore, direct access to the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - It is easy to imagine additional software built on top of the LLM that could assist Biochemists and Biophysicists in analyzing mutations and diseases. This software could potentially help in summarizing research papers, retrieving up-to-date information on mutations, or providing recommendations based on existing data. While the LLM alone may not reduce the time significantly, specialized tools could be developed to enhance the research process.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities would not significantly impact the task of studying mutations in organisms as it primarily involves genetic and molecular analysis rather than visual data.
