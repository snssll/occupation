1: In this task, a First-Line Supervisor of Correctional Officers is responsible for transferring or transporting offenders either on foot or by driving vehicles. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone or with additional software could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality.

- E0: This task involves physical actions such as driving vehicles and potentially handling offenders, which cannot be replaced by the LLM or any software tools. Therefore, this task would not benefit from LLM exposure.

- E1: The task does not involve writing, summarizing text, or any other text-based activities that the LLM could directly assist with. The nature of the task is more operational and hands-on, making it unlikely that direct access to the LLM would reduce the time to complete it by at least half.

- E2: While it is conceivable that software could be developed to assist in scheduling or organizing transportation logistics for offenders, the core task of physically transferring or transporting offenders would still require human intervention. The LLM alone would not significantly reduce the time to complete this task by half.

- E3: The task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images. Therefore, the image capabilities of the LLM would not provide a significant reduction in the time it takes to complete this task.
