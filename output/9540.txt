1: In this task, a Rock Splitter in a quarry marks dimensions or outlines on stone before cutting using rules and chalk lines. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves physical work of marking stone, which cannot be directly performed by an LLM. The LLM cannot physically interact with objects or perform tasks that require physical presence. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not involve text input or output that can be processed by the LLM to reduce the time taken to complete the task.

2: E0

3: High
