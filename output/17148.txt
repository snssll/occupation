1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of training new technicians on forensic science techniques, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM can assist in completing it. 

- E0: This task involves hands-on training and interaction with new technicians, which cannot be effectively replaced by the LLM. The LLM cannot physically demonstrate techniques or provide practical hands-on experience, making it unsuitable for this task.

- E1: The LLM can assist in preparing training materials based on general knowledge of forensic science techniques. It can help in creating written guides, presentations, or manuals that can be used during the training sessions. Additionally, the LLM can generate questions that new technicians might have about the techniques, aiding in the training process.

- E2: While the LLM can provide general information and guidance on forensic science techniques, it may not have access to highly specialized domain knowledge required for training forensic science technicians. Developing additional software on top of the LLM that can retrieve specialized information and create tailored training materials could potentially enhance the efficiency of the training process.

- E3: The task does not involve image capabilities, so exposure to LLM with image capabilities is not relevant for this task.

Based on the above analysis, the most appropriate label for the task of training new technicians on forensic science techniques is E1.

2: E1

3: Moderate
