1: To determine the appropriate label for the task "Engage in research activities related to nursing" for Registered Nurses, we need to consider how the task can be completed with the help of an LLM. 

- Registered Nurses engaging in research activities related to nursing may involve tasks such as literature reviews, data analysis, writing research papers, and staying up-to-date with the latest advancements in the field.
- An LLM can assist in conducting literature reviews by summarizing and synthesizing information from a wide range of sources quickly.
- The LLM can also help in generating initial drafts for research papers based on the input provided.
- It can provide insights and suggestions based on existing research and data, aiding in the analysis process.
- However, the task may require specialized domain knowledge and access to up-to-date information, which the LLM alone may not provide without specific instructions or input.
