1: In this task, a Court Reporter or Simultaneous Captioner is responsible for filing and storing shorthand notes of a court session. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it. 

- The task involves organizing and storing shorthand notes, which is primarily a manual and organizational process.
- The LLM could potentially assist in digitizing the shorthand notes, converting them into a more accessible format, or even providing suggestions on efficient storage methods.
- While the LLM could help with some aspects of the task, such as organizing information or providing templates for storage, the core task of physically filing and storing notes may not be significantly expedited by the LLM alone.
- The task does not involve complex decision-making, specialized domain knowledge, or detailed image processing that would require advanced LLM capabilities beyond text processing.

Based on these considerations, the task of filing and storing shorthand notes of a court session would likely fall under E2 - Exposure by LLM-powered applications. While the LLM could potentially be used to streamline certain aspects of the task, it may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task by half.
