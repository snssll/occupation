1: In this task, the Gambling Cage Workers are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of customers' transactions. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes for a worker to complete this task with high quality. 

- The task of maintaining confidentiality of customers' transactions involves handling sensitive information and ensuring it is kept secure. This task primarily requires adherence to established protocols, policies, and procedures to safeguard customer data.
- The LLM could potentially assist in generating guidelines or training materials related to confidentiality practices. It could also help in drafting communication materials or responses regarding confidentiality policies.
- However, the core aspect of this task involves practical implementation and enforcement of confidentiality measures, which may not be directly impacted by the LLM's capabilities. The LLM cannot physically secure data or monitor transactions in real-time.
