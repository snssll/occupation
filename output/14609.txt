1: In this task, the Electrical Power-Line Installers and Repairers are required to replace or straighten damaged poles. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves physical work that requires hands-on skills and expertise in handling electrical equipment and power lines. It does not involve writing, summarizing, translating, or any other text-based activities that could be directly assisted by an LLM.
- The task does not involve complex data analysis, decision-making based on specialized knowledge, or the need for up-to-date information that an LLM could provide.
- The task is primarily focused on manual labor and technical skills related to electrical infrastructure, which cannot be significantly aided by an LLM or any software built on top of it.

Based on these considerations, the task of replacing or straightening damaged poles for Electrical Power-Line Installers and Repairers would be classified as E0 - No exposure to LLM.
