1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of developing or coordinating fitness and wellness programs or services as a Fitness and Wellness Coordinator, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be aided by the use of a large language model (LLM) like OpenAI's model.

- E1: Direct exposure - In this task, an LLM could be used to generate program ideas, outline program structures, provide information on fitness and wellness trends, and even draft communication materials for these programs. The LLM can assist in writing and transforming text according to complex instructions, summarizing relevant information, and providing feedback on program details. Therefore, direct access to the LLM could significantly reduce the time it takes to develop or coordinate fitness and wellness programs.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the task could potentially benefit from additional software that could summarize longer documents on fitness and wellness trends, retrieve up-to-date information, or provide specialized domain knowledge, the core task of developing and coordinating programs may not require such advanced capabilities beyond what the LLM can offer directly.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not relevant to this task as it primarily involves text-based information and program development rather than image processing.

Based on the above analysis, the task of developing or coordinating fitness and wellness programs or services as a Fitness and Wellness Coordinator aligns most closely with E1: Direct exposure to the LLM.
