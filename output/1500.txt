1: In this task, a cashier is responsible for bagging, boxing, wrapping, or gift-wrapping merchandise and preparing packages for shipment. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves physical actions such as bagging and wrapping items, which cannot be directly performed by an LLM. While the LLM could potentially provide written instructions on how to bag, box, wrap, or gift-wrap merchandise, the actual physical act of doing so would still require human intervention. Therefore, this task does not fall under E1, E2, or E3 as it involves physical actions that cannot be directly completed by the LLM.

2: E0

3: High
