1: In this task, the Merchandise Displayers and Window Trimmers are required to instruct sales staff in color coordination of clothing racks or counter displays. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. This task involves providing instructions and guidance on color coordination, which can be effectively communicated through written or spoken instructions. An LLM could assist in generating detailed instructions on color coordination, providing examples, and explaining the rationale behind certain color choices. The LLM can help in creating training materials or scripts for instructing sales staff on color coordination techniques. While the task does not involve complex data analysis or specialized domain knowledge, the LLM can still significantly reduce the time needed to prepare instructional materials.
