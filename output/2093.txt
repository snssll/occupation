1: In this task, a Carpet Installer is responsible for cleaning up before and after carpet installation, which includes vacuuming the carpet and discarding leftover pieces. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM could significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality. 

- E0: This task involves physical labor that cannot be automated by the LLM. The actual cleaning, vacuuming, and discarding of carpet remnants require manual work and cannot be performed by the LLM or any software tool.
- E1: While the LLM could potentially provide instructions or guidelines on how to clean up before and after installation, the actual physical work of vacuuming and discarding remnants cannot be done by the LLM. Therefore, the time saved by using the LLM for this task would not be significant enough to warrant an E1 label.
- E2: It is challenging to imagine additional software that could be developed on top of the LLM to automate the physical cleaning tasks involved in carpet installation. The nature of this task is hands-on and requires manual labor, which cannot be easily replaced by software.
- E3: The task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images. Therefore, the use of image capabilities alongside the LLM would not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task.

Based on the above analysis, the most appropriate label for this task is E0.

2: E0

3: Certainty level: High
