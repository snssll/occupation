1: In this task, a Telecommunications Equipment Installer and Repairer is required to clean switches and replace contact points using various tools. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality. Since this task involves physical work with tools and equipment, it does not seem feasible for the LLM to directly assist in the hands-on aspect of cleaning switches and replacing contact points. The LLM cannot physically interact with equipment or tools, and it cannot perform tasks that require precise measurements or physical manipulation. Therefore, the task does not fall under E1, E2, or E3 categories.

2: E0
