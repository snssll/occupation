1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of adjusting network sizes to meet volume or capacity demands for Computer Network Architects, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. In this task, the Computer Network Architects need to analyze network requirements and adjust network sizes accordingly. The LLM can assist in providing information on network architecture, best practices, and potentially suggest solutions based on the input provided. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM can help in providing information on network architecture, capacity planning, and potential solutions based on the input provided. It can assist in generating text-based recommendations or summaries related to network adjustments.
- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not reduce the time significantly for this task, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to automate the process of analyzing network requirements, suggesting adjustments, and potentially even implementing changes in network sizes based on the data provided.
- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not directly relevant to the task of adjusting network sizes, so this label does not apply.

2: E2

3: Moderate
