1: In this task, the tutor needs to research and recommend textbooks, software, equipment, or other learning materials to complement tutoring. With access to the powerful OpenAI large language model (LLM), the tutor can efficiently gather information on a wide range of textbooks, software, equipment, and learning materials. The LLM can provide insights into the latest educational resources, reviews, and recommendations based on specific criteria provided by the tutor. The model can also assist in comparing different options, summarizing key points, and generating tailored recommendations. Overall, the LLM can significantly streamline the research process and enhance the quality of recommendations made by the tutor.

Considering the capabilities of the LLM in assisting with research, analysis, and recommendation tasks related to educational materials, this task falls under E1 - Direct exposure.
