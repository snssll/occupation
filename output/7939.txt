1: In this task of inspecting horticultural products or livestock, the Agricultural Inspectors need to assess the quality of the products or animals, detect diseases, chemical residues, or infestations. To complete this task, the inspectors rely on their expertise in agriculture, biology, and related fields. The task involves visual inspection, knowledge of symptoms of diseases, and understanding quality standards. While the LLM could potentially provide information on common diseases or quality standards, it cannot physically inspect the products or animals. The task also requires hands-on work and direct observation, which the LLM cannot perform. Therefore, the task does not seem to benefit significantly from the LLM's capabilities, as it cannot replace the physical inspection aspect.
