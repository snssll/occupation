1: In this task, a Medical Appliance Technician is responsible for fitting appliances onto patients and making any necessary adjustments. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves hands-on work that requires physical interaction with patients, such as fitting appliances and making adjustments based on patient needs. This task cannot be directly performed by an LLM as it requires physical presence, manual dexterity, and the ability to interact with patients in a healthcare setting. The LLM cannot replace the practical skills and expertise needed to perform this task effectively. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not benefit from the capabilities of the LLM.
