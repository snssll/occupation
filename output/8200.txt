1: In this task, a plumber, pipefitter, or steamfitter is required to install underground piping systems for storm, sanitary, or water purposes. The task involves extending piping to connect fixtures and plumbing. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality. 

Given the nature of the task, which involves physical installation work underground, precise measurements, and hands-on skills, it is unlikely that the LLM or any tools built on top of it can assist in completing this task. The task requires practical knowledge, experience, and physical labor that cannot be replaced by text-based information or AI capabilities. Therefore, the exposure to LLM for this task would be classified as E0.

2: E0

3: High
