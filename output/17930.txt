1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of writing or updating standard operating procedures, work instructions, or policies as a Regulatory Affairs Specialist, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could assist in completing it. 

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** The task involves writing and updating documents based on specific guidelines and regulations. The LLM can assist by providing relevant information, generating text based on input, and ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements. The model can help with drafting sections, ensuring clarity and consistency, and incorporating up-to-date information. Overall, the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality by providing guidance and generating content.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the LLM can assist in writing and updating documents, additional software could be developed to streamline the process further. This software could include features like summarizing regulatory changes, retrieving specific regulatory information quickly, or providing templates for standard operating procedures. Such tools could enhance efficiency but may not be necessary for completing the task effectively.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Image capabilities are not relevant for the task of writing or updating standard operating procedures, work instructions, or policies. This task primarily involves text-based work and does not require image processing.
