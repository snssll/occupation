1: In this task, an orthopedic surgeon is required to examine a patient to obtain information on the medical condition and surgical risk. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves direct interaction with a patient, physical examination, and assessment of medical conditions, which cannot be performed by an LLM. The task also requires specialized medical knowledge, experience, and skills that go beyond what an LLM can provide. As such, this task falls under the category of tasks that require a high degree of human interaction and specialized expertise, making it unsuitable for automation or assistance from an LLM. Therefore, this task is best classified as E0 - No exposure.

2: E0

3: High
