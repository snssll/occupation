1: In this task, a Sports Medicine Physician is required to develop and test procedures for dealing with emergencies during practices or competitions. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we can break down the task:
- Writing and transforming text: The physician may need to write down detailed emergency procedures in text form.
- Providing edits to existing text: The physician may need to review and update existing emergency procedures.
- Analyzing written information to inform decisions: The physician will need to analyze different emergency scenarios and determine the best course of action.
- Providing counsel on issues: The physician will provide guidance on how to handle emergencies effectively.

Given that the task involves primarily working with text (developing procedures, analyzing information, providing counsel), the direct access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality. Therefore, this task falls under label E1.
