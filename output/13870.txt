1: In this task, a Stocker and Order Filler is responsible for receiving, unloading, opening, unpacking, or issuing sales floor merchandise. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality. 

- The task involves physical actions such as unloading and unpacking merchandise, which cannot be directly assisted by the LLM.
- While the LLM could potentially provide written instructions or documentation related to stock management, it cannot physically handle the merchandise.
- The task does not involve complex decision-making, specialized knowledge, or detailed analysis that would benefit significantly from LLM capabilities.
- Overall, the task is primarily manual and operational in nature, with minimal text-based components that could be streamlined by the LLM.

Based on these considerations, the task of receiving, unloading, opening, unpacking, or issuing sales floor merchandise is best classified as E0 - No exposure.
