1: In this task, a First-Line Supervisor of Correctional Officers is responsible for restraining, securing, or controlling offenders using various means, including chemical agents, firearms, or other weapons of force. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task and how an LLM could potentially assist in completing it. 

- E0: This task involves physical actions that require hands-on intervention and decision-making in real-time situations. It also involves the use of force and weapons, which are sensitive and legally regulated areas. An LLM or LLM-powered tool cannot physically restrain or control offenders, and decisions related to the use of force should not be automated or delegated to AI due to ethical and legal considerations. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it cannot be effectively completed by an LLM.
