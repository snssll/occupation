1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of "Inventory stock and requisition new stock" for Retail Salespersons in terms of exposure to LLM, we need to consider the nature of the task. This task involves managing inventory levels, tracking stock, and ordering new items when necessary. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The task of inventory management and stock requisition involves a significant amount of written communication and record-keeping. An LLM could assist in generating inventory reports, analyzing stock levels, drafting requisition orders, and even providing insights into trends that may impact stock levels. The LLM could also help in writing emails to suppliers or internal teams regarding stock needs. Therefore, direct access to the LLM could reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality by at least half.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the task could benefit from additional software that integrates with the LLM to automate inventory tracking, generate predictive stock orders based on trends, or provide real-time updates on stock levels, the core task of inventory management and stock requisition can still be effectively completed with the LLM alone. Therefore, the task does not necessarily require additional software beyond the LLM itself to be completed efficiently.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not essential for the task of inventory management and stock requisition. This task primarily involves text-based activities such as tracking inventory levels, generating reports, and communicating stock needs, which can be effectively handled by the LLM without the need for image capabilities.
