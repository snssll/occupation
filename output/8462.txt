1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of interviewing survivors, witnesses, suspects, and other law enforcement personnel as a Police Identification and Records Officer, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be impacted by the use of the LLM.

- E0: This task involves direct human interaction and relies heavily on interpersonal skills, empathy, and the ability to read non-verbal cues. The task also requires the ability to adapt to different situations and individuals, which cannot be effectively replicated by an LLM.

- E1: While the LLM can assist in generating potential interview questions or providing background information on individuals, it cannot replace the nuanced communication and rapport-building skills required for effective interviews. The task involves real-time interaction and the ability to assess credibility and emotions, which are challenging for an LLM to replicate.

- E2: It is conceivable that software could be developed to assist in organizing interview notes, summarizing key points, or even providing suggestions for follow-up questions based on the input data. However, the core aspect of conducting interviews, especially in law enforcement settings, involves human judgment, discretion, and the ability to handle sensitive information, which goes beyond the capabilities of the LLM alone.

- E3: The task of interviewing individuals does not significantly benefit from image capabilities, as it primarily involves verbal communication and interpersonal skills rather than visual information processing.
