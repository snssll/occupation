1: In this task of performing team support duties for athletic trainers, the main responsibilities involve running errands, maintaining equipment, and stocking supplies. These tasks do not require complex decision-making or specialized knowledge beyond basic organizational skills. An LLM could potentially assist in generating checklists for errands, equipment maintenance schedules, or supply inventory lists. The model could also help in drafting communication materials related to these tasks. However, since the task is primarily operational and hands-on, involving physical activities like stocking supplies and maintaining equipment, the LLM's assistance would be limited to providing written instructions or documentation support rather than directly performing the physical tasks.

Considering the nature of the task and the limitations of the LLM in performing physical actions, the exposure to LLM for this task would fall under E0. While the LLM can assist in generating written materials related to the task, it cannot directly reduce the time it takes for an athletic trainer to complete the physical aspects of team support duties.
