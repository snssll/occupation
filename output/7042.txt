1: In this task, a Furniture Finisher is required to follow blueprints to produce specific designs. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone or with additional software could significantly reduce the time it takes for a Furniture Finisher to complete the task of following blueprints to produce specific designs.

- E0: This task involves physical work and precise measurements, which cannot be effectively assisted by the LLM alone. The LLM cannot provide hands-on assistance or interact with physical blueprints.

- E1: The LLM could potentially assist by providing text-based instructions, clarifications, or summaries related to the blueprints. It could also help in generating written documentation or reports based on the designs. However, the direct access to the LLM may not reduce the time significantly for a Furniture Finisher to follow blueprints.

- E2: While the LLM alone may not reduce the time significantly for this task, additional software could be developed to assist Furniture Finishers. This software could potentially analyze complex blueprints, provide real-time feedback on design choices, or even generate 3D visualizations based on the blueprints, thereby enhancing the efficiency of the Furniture Finishers.

- E3: Image capabilities could potentially assist in this task by allowing the LLM to view and interpret digital images of blueprints. This could help in quickly scanning and analyzing blueprint details, potentially reducing the time required for Furniture Finishers to follow the designs.
