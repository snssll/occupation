1: In this task, a Clinical Neuropsychologist is required to educate and supervise practicum students, psychology interns, or hospital staff. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves providing education and supervision, which primarily involves written and spoken communication. An LLM could assist in generating educational materials, providing feedback on documents related to supervision, answering questions about educational content, and potentially even simulating conversations for training purposes. The LLM could also help in preparing training materials based on general knowledge or providing feedback on written reports. However, the task does not involve any specialized domain knowledge or highly complex databases that would require additional software beyond the capabilities of the LLM. Therefore, the task falls under E1 as the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality by providing assistance in generating educational materials, feedback, and training materials.
