1: In this task, a Cooling and Freezing Equipment Operator and Tender needs to read dials and gauges on panel control boards to determine temperatures, alkalinities, and densities of mixtures. They then have to adjust valves to achieve specified mixtures. This task involves a combination of monitoring equipment readings, interpreting data, and making adjustments based on the information obtained. While an LLM could potentially provide information on the general principles of operating cooling and freezing equipment, it cannot physically read dials, gauges, or turn valves. The task is hands-on and requires physical interaction with machinery, which is not something an LLM can do. Therefore, the task falls under E0 as it does not involve text-based information processing that the LLM can assist with.
