1: In this task, a painter in construction and maintenance bakes finishes on painted or enameled articles using baking ovens. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves a physical process of baking finishes on articles, which requires hands-on work with baking ovens. This task does not involve text input or output, and the context is related to physical actions rather than information processing. As such, this task falls under the category of physical labor that cannot be directly assisted by an LLM or any software tool based on it. Therefore, this task would be classified as E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM or any software tool built on top of it.
