1: Hazardous Materials Removal Workers are responsible for safely removing hazardous materials, such as mold, from various sites. The task provided involves cleaning mold-contaminated sites by removing damaged porous materials or thoroughly cleaning all contaminated nonporous materials. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be significantly expedited or improved by using the language model. In this case, the task involves physical work that requires manual labor and expertise in handling hazardous materials. While the LLM could potentially provide information on best practices for mold removal, it cannot physically perform the cleaning or removal process. Therefore, the task does not align with the capabilities of the LLM in a way that would significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task.
