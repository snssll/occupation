1: In this task, New Accounts Clerks are required to interview customers to gather necessary information for opening accounts or renting safe-deposit boxes. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- E0: This task involves direct human interaction, where the clerk needs to interview customers face-to-face. The task requires interpersonal skills, active listening, and the ability to build rapport with customers. These are aspects that cannot be effectively replaced by an LLM or any software tool.

- E1: While an LLM could potentially assist in drafting standardized interview questions or providing guidance on account opening procedures, the core aspect of interviewing customers, understanding their responses, and building a relationship with them is highly reliant on human interaction and judgment. The nuanced communication and empathy required in such interactions are beyond the capabilities of current LLMs.

- E2: Developing software on top of an LLM that could potentially assist in summarizing customer responses, organizing data collected during interviews, or providing background information on customers may be conceivable. However, the fundamental aspect of conducting interviews and establishing trust with customers remains a human-centric task.

- E3: The task does not involve image processing or analysis, so the image capabilities of the LLM are not relevant in this context.
