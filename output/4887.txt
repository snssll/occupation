1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of developing final construction plans as an architect using the LLM, we need to consider the capabilities of the model. The LLM can assist in generating text, providing feedback on documents, and summarizing medium-length documents. In this case, the task involves creating aesthetic representations of structures, which may require visual elements that the LLM may not be able to directly assist with. While the LLM could potentially help with generating text descriptions or providing feedback on written aspects of the plans, it may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task of developing visual representations. Therefore, the task may not fall under E1 where direct access to the LLM could reduce the time by at least half. Additionally, while it is conceivable that specialized software could be developed on top of the LLM to assist with visual representations, such software is not currently available, placing the task outside of E2 as well. Since the task does not involve image capabilities that the LLM can leverage, it also does not fall under E3. Considering these factors, the task of developing final construction plans as an architect is best classified as E0.
