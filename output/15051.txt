1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of reviewing grant applications or making funding recommendations as a Conservation Scientist, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be impacted by the use of the LLM.

- E1: Direct exposure - In this case, the LLM could potentially assist in reviewing grant applications by providing summaries, analyzing text for key points, and generating recommendations based on the criteria provided. The LLM could help in processing large amounts of text efficiently and highlighting important information for consideration.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time it takes to review grant applications, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to create tools that summarize grant applications, extract key information, and provide recommendations based on specific criteria. This additional software could enhance the efficiency of the review process.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities would not have a significant impact on reviewing grant applications or making funding recommendations in this context, as the task primarily involves text-based information rather than images.

Based on the considerations above, the task of reviewing grant applications or making funding recommendations as a Conservation Scientist could be best classified as E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications.
