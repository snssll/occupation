1: In this task, the accountant or auditor is required to confer with company officials about financial and regulatory matters. To complete this task, the accountant or auditor needs to have a deep understanding of financial principles, regulations, and company-specific financial data. The LLM could potentially assist in providing general information on financial regulations or principles, but it may not have access to specific company data or up-to-date financial information. The LLM could help in drafting communication or providing background information, but the actual discussion and decision-making would likely require human judgment and interaction. Therefore, the task does not seem to fit into any of the exposure categories as it involves a high degree of human interaction and decision-making that cannot be fully automated by the LLM.
