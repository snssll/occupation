1: In this task, a First-Line Supervisor of Non-Retail Sales Workers is required to listen to and resolve customer complaints regarding services, products, or personnel. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we can break down the task as follows:

- Listening to customer complaints: The LLM can assist in providing guidance on active listening techniques and strategies to effectively listen to customer complaints.
- Resolving customer complaints: The LLM can help generate response templates, suggest possible solutions, or provide examples of successful complaint resolution strategies.

Considering the nature of the task, it involves human interaction, empathy, and decision-making based on nuanced customer feedback. While the LLM can provide some support in terms of language and communication, it cannot fully replace the human judgment and emotional intelligence required to effectively resolve customer complaints.
