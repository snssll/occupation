1: In this task, an optometrist is required to prescribe therapeutic procedures to correct or conserve vision for patients. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves applying specialized medical knowledge and expertise to assess a patient's vision and recommend appropriate therapeutic procedures. This task requires a deep understanding of optometry, including knowledge of eye conditions, treatment options, and patient care.

Given that the task involves specialized domain knowledge and expertise in optometry, it is unlikely that direct access to an LLM would significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality. While an LLM could potentially provide general information on vision correction procedures, it may not have the specific expertise required to make accurate and tailored recommendations for individual patients. Additionally, the task involves making medical decisions that impact patient health, which may require human judgment and interaction beyond what an LLM can provide.

Considering these factors, it is more appropriate to classify this task as E0, as direct access to an LLM alone is unlikely to reduce the time it takes for an experienced optometrist to complete the task with high quality by at least half.
