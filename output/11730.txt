1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of performing thermal, stress, or cost reduction analyses for solar systems as a Solar Energy Systems Engineer, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be aided by the use of a large language model (LLM).

- This task involves analyzing data related to thermal performance, stress factors, and cost considerations for solar energy systems. The LLM can assist in providing information on best practices, industry standards, and potential solutions for optimizing these systems.
- The LLM can help generate reports, summaries, and recommendations based on the input data provided for the analyses.
- It can also assist in researching the latest trends, technologies, and innovations in the field of solar energy systems to ensure that the analyses are up-to-date and comprehensive.
- While the LLM can provide valuable insights and recommendations, the task itself requires specialized knowledge and expertise in solar energy systems engineering, which the LLM may not possess.

Based on these considerations, the task of performing thermal, stress, or cost reduction analyses for solar systems would fall under label E2 - Exposure by LLM-powered applications. This is because while the LLM can provide support in generating reports, summaries, and recommendations, additional software specifically tailored for analyzing and optimizing solar energy systems could further enhance the efficiency of completing this task.
