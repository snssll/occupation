1: For the task of devising missions, challenges, or puzzles in video game design, the exposure to LLM can be evaluated as follows:

- E1: Direct access to the LLM could potentially assist in generating ideas for missions, challenges, or puzzles by providing creative prompts, brainstorming assistance, or even specific examples based on existing games. The LLM could help in generating text descriptions or narratives for these game elements.

- E2: While the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time to complete this task, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to create tools specifically tailored for video game design. This software could potentially analyze player behavior data, suggest mission structures based on trends, or even simulate gameplay scenarios to test the devised missions, challenges, or puzzles.

- E3: Image capabilities are not directly relevant to the task of devising missions, challenges, or puzzles in video game design, as it primarily involves text-based creativity and game design concepts rather than visual elements.

Based on the above analysis, the task of devising missions, challenges, or puzzles in video game design could be best classified as E2.

2: E2
