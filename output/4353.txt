- The LLM can assist in generating text and providing structured information based on input criteria. It can help in drafting the content of the forms, suggesting fields, and organizing information logically.
- While the LLM can aid in text generation and structuring, it may not have specific knowledge about optimal form design principles or industry-specific requirements for filing systems.
