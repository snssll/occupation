1: In this task, the Computer and Information Research Scientists or Computer and Information Systems Managers would be responsible for developing and interpreting organizational goals, policies, and procedures. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task. 

Computer and Information Research Scientists or Computer and Information Systems Managers may need to research and analyze a vast amount of information to develop and interpret organizational goals, policies, and procedures. The LLM could assist in providing relevant information, summarizing existing policies, generating potential goals based on data, and even drafting initial versions of procedures. However, the task also involves a high level of decision-making, strategic planning, and domain-specific knowledge that may not be fully covered by the LLM alone. While the LLM can provide valuable insights and information, it may not be able to replace the expertise and experience required for this task entirely.
