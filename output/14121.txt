1: In this task, the Food and Tobacco Roasting, Baking, and Drying Machine Operators and Tenders are required to record production data related to the processing of food and tobacco products. With the help of the LLM, the operator could potentially automate the process of recording this data by inputting the relevant information and having the LLM generate a detailed production report. The LLM could assist in summarizing the data, organizing it, and potentially even providing insights based on trends in the recorded information. This task involves maintaining records of written data, which falls under the E1 category as the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality.
