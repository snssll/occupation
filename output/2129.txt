1: In this task of cleaning, lubricating, or adjusting parts, equipment, or machinery, the exposure to LLM can be evaluated as follows:

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** The task involves straightforward instructions that can be easily understood and executed by an industrial machinery mechanic. The LLM could potentially provide guidance on the specific cleaning, lubricating, or adjusting procedures for different types of machinery. The mechanic could input details about the machinery in question, and the LLM could generate step-by-step instructions or recommendations based on best practices. This direct access to information could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the LLM alone may not reduce the time it takes to complete the task by half, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to create interactive guides or tutorials specifically tailored to different types of machinery. These applications could provide detailed instructions, safety precautions, and troubleshooting tips, enhancing the mechanic's efficiency in performing the task.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Image capabilities would not significantly impact the completion of this task, as it primarily involves physical maintenance of machinery rather than visual or image-related aspects.
