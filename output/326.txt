1: In this task, the Social and Human Service Assistants are required to advise clients on various social services such as food stamps, child care, money management, sanitation, and housekeeping. To determine the appropriate exposure label for this task:

- The task involves providing advice and guidance to clients on specific social services, which can be effectively communicated through text input and output.
- The LLM can assist in generating responses, recommendations, and information related to food stamps, child care, money management, sanitation, and housekeeping based on the input provided.
- The LLM can help in formulating appropriate responses to common queries or scenarios related to these social services, thereby reducing the time needed to draft responses manually.
- While the task may require some level of human judgment and empathy, the core aspect of providing information and advice can be facilitated by the LLM.

Based on these considerations, the task of advising clients regarding social services aligns most closely with the E1 exposure label. The LLM can significantly reduce the time needed to provide accurate and relevant information to clients in this context.
