1: In this task, a Surveying and Mapping Technician is required to adjust and operate surveying instruments such as prisms, theodolites, electronic distance measuring equipment, or electronic data collectors. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if the task can be significantly expedited or improved by using the LLM. 

- The task involves technical skills related to operating surveying instruments, which require hands-on experience and knowledge of surveying techniques.
- The task does not involve extensive text-based information processing or generation that could benefit from the LLM's capabilities.
- The LLM is not equipped to physically adjust or operate surveying instruments, as this task requires practical skills and real-world interaction with equipment.

Based on these considerations, the task of adjusting and operating surveying instruments is not suitable for exposure to the LLM, as it does not involve text-based information processing or tasks that the LLM can directly assist with.
