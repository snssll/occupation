1: In this task, a Labor Relations Specialist is required to provide expert testimony in legal proceedings related to labor relations or labor contracts. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. Providing expert testimony involves a deep understanding of labor relations, legal frameworks, and specific cases. The task requires the specialist to present complex information, analyze data, and communicate effectively in a legal setting.

- E0: This task involves human interaction in legal proceedings, where the specialist's expertise, experience, and judgment are crucial. The task cannot be fully automated or replaced by LLMs as it requires the specialist's unique knowledge and skills to navigate legal complexities and provide testimony.

- E1: While the LLM can assist in generating written content or summaries related to labor relations or legal concepts, it cannot replace the specialist's expertise in providing testimony in legal proceedings. The task involves nuanced understanding, interpretation, and application of legal knowledge that goes beyond text generation.

- E2: Developing software on top of the LLM that could summarize legal documents, provide case analysis, or offer recommendations based on legal data might assist the specialist in preparing for testimony. However, the core task of providing expert testimony still heavily relies on the specialist's domain knowledge and experience.

- E3: Image capabilities are not relevant for this task as it primarily involves legal proceedings and verbal communication rather than visual content.
