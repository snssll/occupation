1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of configuring WAN or LAN routers as a Computer Network Support Specialist, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be aided by the use of a large language model (LLM).

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** The task of configuring WAN or LAN routers involves technical knowledge, understanding of network protocols, and specific configurations. While an LLM could potentially assist in providing general information or explanations related to network configurations, it may not have the specific technical expertise required to configure routers accurately. Therefore, direct access to an LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** It is conceivable that additional software could be developed on top of an LLM that could assist in configuring WAN or LAN routers. This software could potentially provide step-by-step guides, troubleshoot common issues, or offer recommendations based on best practices in network configuration. Such a tool could enhance the efficiency of the task by leveraging the LLM's capabilities in providing technical information and guidance.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Image capabilities would not significantly impact the task of configuring WAN or LAN routers, as it primarily involves working with network configurations and equipment rather than visual data.

Considering the above analysis, the task of configuring WAN or LAN routers as a Computer Network Support Specialist is best classified as **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications)**.
