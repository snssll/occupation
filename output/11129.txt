1: In this task, the main activities involve packing and shipping pottery to stores or galleries for retail sale. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if access to the LLM or LLM-powered tools can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with high quality.

- E0: This task involves physical actions such as packing and shipping, which cannot be directly assisted by the LLM or LLM-powered tools. The task also does not involve complex decision-making or specialized knowledge that the LLM could provide.

- E1: The task does not involve writing, transforming text, providing edits, translating, summarizing documents, answering questions, or any other text-based activities that the LLM could directly assist with. Therefore, direct access to the LLM would not reduce the time significantly for completing this task.

- E2: While it is conceivable that software could be developed to streamline inventory management, logistics, or retail operations related to packing and shipping, the task itself does not inherently lend itself to direct LLM assistance. The LLM may not be able to provide real-time information on shipping logistics or inventory management without up-to-date data, which is not specified in the task.

- E3: The task does not involve image capabilities, reading text from PDFs, or creating/editing digital images, so exposure to LLM and image capabilities would not significantly reduce the time to complete this task.
