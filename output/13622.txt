1: In this task, a tailor, dressmaker, or custom sewer is required to put in padding and shaping materials. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. This task involves physical manipulation of materials to shape and pad garments, which cannot be directly performed by an LLM. While an LLM could potentially provide information on techniques or materials to use, it cannot physically execute the task of putting in padding and shaping materials. Therefore, this task does not fall under E1, E2, or E3 as it does not involve text input or output, image capabilities, or specialized software that could be developed on top of the LLM to complete the task.

2: E0

3: High
