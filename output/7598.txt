1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of implementing operational and emergency procedures as Industrial Production Managers, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be supported by the capabilities of the LLM.

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** The task of implementing operational and emergency procedures involves a significant amount of written documentation, guidelines, and protocols. An LLM could assist in generating, refining, or summarizing these documents based on specific instructions provided by the Industrial Production Managers. The LLM could help in creating detailed operational manuals, emergency response plans, or even training materials related to these procedures. Additionally, the LLM could be used to draft communication messages or emails related to operational changes or emergency situations.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the LLM alone may not reduce the time it takes to complete the task by half, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to enhance the efficiency of implementing operational and emergency procedures. This software could include features like summarizing complex operational guidelines, retrieving up-to-date information on emergency protocols, or analyzing data to inform decisions related to operational management.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Image capabilities would not significantly impact the task of implementing operational and emergency procedures, as the task primarily involves written documentation, protocols, and communication rather than visual content.
