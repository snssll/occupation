1: In this task, a Fire Inspector or Investigator is required to dust evidence or portions of fire scenes for latent fingerprints. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be aided by the LLM. 

- Dusting evidence for latent fingerprints involves physical actions and specialized skills that cannot be directly assisted by the LLM.
- The task requires hands-on work and expertise in forensic techniques, which are not within the capabilities of the LLM.
- The LLM cannot physically interact with the environment or perform tasks that require physical presence, such as dusting for fingerprints at a fire scene.

Based on these considerations, it is clear that the task of dusting evidence for latent fingerprints in fire scenes falls under E0 as it involves physical actions and specialized skills that cannot be directly assisted by the LLM.
