1: In this task, a Phlebotomist is required to match laboratory requisition forms to specimen tubes. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be aided by the LLM. 

- The task involves a straightforward matching process that does not require complex decision-making or specialized knowledge beyond what is typically learned in training for this occupation.
- The task does not involve writing, summarizing documents, or analyzing text, which are areas where the LLM excels.
- While the LLM could potentially assist in generating training materials related to phlebotomy, this specific task of matching forms to tubes does not directly benefit from the LLM's capabilities.
- There is no need for image capabilities as the task does not involve reading text from PDFs or scanning images.

Based on these considerations, the task of matching laboratory requisition forms to specimen tubes falls under E0 as it does not significantly benefit from the capabilities of the LLM.
