1: In this task, a technical writer is responsible for coordinating the typing, duplication, and distribution of material. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The task involves organizing and managing the logistics of material production and distribution. While the LLM could potentially assist in generating written content or instructions related to the typing and duplication process, it may not significantly reduce the time it takes to arrange for typing, duplication, and distribution of material.
  
- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - It is conceivable that additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to streamline the coordination and management aspects of arranging for typing, duplication, and distribution. This software could potentially automate certain processes or provide recommendations based on data input.
  
- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Since the task primarily involves text-based activities like typing, duplication, and distribution, image capabilities would not significantly impact the completion of this task.

Based on the analysis, the task of arranging for typing, duplication, and distribution of material falls under E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications.
