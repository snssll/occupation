1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of collaborating with architects or related professionals on whole building design as a Landscape Architect, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be impacted by the use of an LLM.

- Landscape Architects collaborate with architects to enhance the aesthetic features of structures and surrounding land. This task involves communication, design input, and expertise in landscaping and architecture.
- An LLM could potentially assist in providing information on the latest trends in landscaping and architecture, generating design ideas, summarizing relevant documents on energy-efficient design practices, or even drafting communication materials for collaboration.
- While the LLM could help with generating text-based content related to design ideas or energy-efficient practices, it may not significantly reduce the time it takes for a Landscape Architect to collaborate with other professionals on whole building design, as this task involves a high level of human interaction, creativity, and specialized knowledge that an LLM may not fully capture.
