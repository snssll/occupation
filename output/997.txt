1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of arranging meetings between buyers and sellers as a Real Estate Sales Agent, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The task involves coordinating meetings between parties for negotiation, which can be facilitated through written communication. The LLM can help draft emails or messages to schedule these meetings efficiently, saving time and ensuring clear communication between buyers and sellers.
- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time it takes to arrange meetings, additional software could be developed to integrate with the LLM for tasks like analyzing schedules, suggesting optimal meeting times, or providing negotiation tips based on data analysis.
- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not relevant for this task as it primarily involves written communication and scheduling meetings, which can be handled effectively by the LLM without the need for image processing.

Based on the above analysis, the task of arranging meetings between buyers and sellers as a Real Estate Sales Agent is best classified as E1: Direct exposure.
