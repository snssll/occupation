1: In this task, an Engine and Other Machine Assembler is required to remove rough spots and smooth surfaces to fit, trim, or clean parts using hand tools or power tools. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. This task involves physical manipulation of parts using tools, which cannot be directly assisted by an LLM. The task requires hands-on work and precise physical actions that cannot be replaced by text-based instructions or responses from the LLM. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not involve any text-based activities that can be significantly aided by the LLM.
