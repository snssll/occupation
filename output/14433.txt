1: In this task, an Aircraft Mechanic or Service Technician is required to remove or cut out defective parts or drill holes to access internal defects or damage using drills and punches. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. This task involves physical work that requires manual dexterity and technical skills to work on aircraft components. It does not involve writing, summarizing documents, analyzing text, or any other activity that could be directly assisted by an LLM. The task is hands-on and requires practical knowledge of aircraft maintenance and repair, which cannot be effectively replaced by an LLM. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not benefit from the capabilities of an LLM.
