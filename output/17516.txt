1: In this task, the Pressers are responsible for using covering cloths to protect delicate fabrics from being damaged by equipment. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if the task can be significantly expedited or improved by using the LLM. Since this task involves physical actions such as placing covering cloths on equipment, it does not involve text input or output that the LLM can directly assist with. Additionally, the task does not involve complex decision-making, analysis, or information retrieval that would benefit from the LLM's capabilities. Therefore, this task does not align with any of the exposure labels provided.
