1: In this task, a Plasterer and Stucco Mason applies insulation to building exteriors using prefabricated insulation systems or insulation board, reinforcing mesh, and a base coat. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. This task involves physical work that requires hands-on application of materials to building exteriors. It does not involve text input or output, complex instructions, data analysis, or decision-making that can be easily automated by an LLM. The task also does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images. Therefore, this task does not align with any of the exposure levels in the rubric.
