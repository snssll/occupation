1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of recommending or implementing changes to fuel cell system designs as a Fuel Cell Engineer, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be aided by the use of a large language model (LLM) like OpenAI's model.

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** If the task involves writing and transforming text or code related to fuel cell system designs, providing edits to existing designs, or generating recommendations based on specific criteria, the LLM could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality. The LLM can assist in drafting design proposals, analyzing data, and suggesting improvements based on the input provided.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the LLM alone may not reduce the time by half for this task, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to summarize complex technical documents related to fuel cell systems, retrieve up-to-date information on the latest advancements in fuel cell technology, or provide recommendations based on data analysis and domain-specific knowledge.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Image capabilities are not directly relevant to the task of recommending or implementing changes to fuel cell system designs. This task primarily involves text-based inputs related to engineering designs and technical specifications, which can be effectively handled by the LLM without the need for image processing.
