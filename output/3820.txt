1: In this task, a podiatrist is required to correct deformities in patients' feet using plaster casts and strapping. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves physical manipulation of patients' feet, which cannot be performed by an LLM or any software tool. The task requires hands-on skills, precision, and direct interaction with patients. As such, this task falls under the category of tasks that cannot be automated or assisted by LLMs. Therefore, this task would be classified as E0 as it does not involve any text-based or image-related activities that could benefit from LLM capabilities.
