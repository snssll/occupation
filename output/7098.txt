1: In this task, a First-Line Supervisor of Retail Sales Workers is required to formulate pricing policies for merchandise based on profitability requirements. To complete this task, the supervisor needs to consider various factors such as cost of goods, profit margins, competition, market demand, and pricing strategies. The supervisor may need to analyze financial data, market trends, and sales reports to make informed decisions on pricing policies.

Considering the task description, the most relevant exposure label from the rubric would be E2 - Exposure by LLM-powered applications. While the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time it takes to formulate pricing policies, additional software built on top of the LLM could enhance the process. This software could potentially retrieve up-to-date market data, analyze financial information, and provide recommendations based on the input provided by the supervisor. By leveraging the LLM's capabilities along with specialized tools, the task could be completed more efficiently.
