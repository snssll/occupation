1: In this task, a Low Vision Therapist, Orientation and Mobility Specialist, or Vision Rehabilitation Therapist teaches clients to travel independently using various travel situations or exercises. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if access to the LLM or LLM-powered tools can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality.

- Low Vision Therapists, Orientation and Mobility Specialists, and Vision Rehabilitation Therapists require hands-on, personalized training and guidance to teach clients with visual impairments how to navigate their surroundings safely and independently. This task involves physical movement, observation, and real-time feedback, which cannot be effectively replaced by text-based interactions with an LLM.
- While an LLM could potentially provide some general information or resources related to travel techniques for individuals with visual impairments, the core aspect of teaching clients in real-world scenarios would still heavily rely on in-person interactions and practical demonstrations.
- The nature of this task involves a high degree of human interaction, physical movement, and personalized instruction, which are not easily replicable through text-based interactions with an LLM. Therefore, the exposure to LLM for this task would be classified as E0.
