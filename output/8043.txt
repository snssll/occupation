1: In this task of inspecting, repairing, or replacing brake systems as a Recreational Vehicle Service Technician, the use of the LLM could potentially fall under E2 exposure. While the LLM could assist in providing general information on brake systems, it may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task by half. However, with additional software development, a specialized application could be created to provide detailed instructions, diagrams, or troubleshooting steps specific to recreational vehicle brake systems, which could enhance efficiency and reduce the time needed to complete the task.
