1: In this task, a psychiatric technician is required to observe and influence patients' behavior, communicate and interact with them, and provide various forms of support such as teaching, counseling, or befriending. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be significantly aided by the use of the language model. The LLM could potentially assist in providing guidance on effective communication strategies, suggesting counseling techniques, or offering insights into behavioral patterns. It could also help in generating scripts for interactions or counseling sessions. However, the task heavily relies on human interaction, empathy, and real-time observation, which are aspects that the LLM may not be able to fully replicate. While the LLM can provide information and suggestions, the nuanced and dynamic nature of human interaction in a psychiatric setting may limit the direct impact of the model on the task.
