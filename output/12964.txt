1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of presenting research findings at professional meetings as a Sociologist, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it. 

- Sociologists typically conduct research, analyze data, and draw conclusions based on their findings. Presenting research findings at professional meetings involves preparing a presentation that effectively communicates the research results to an audience of peers.
- The LLM could assist in generating written content for the presentation, helping to summarize key points, provide explanations, and craft engaging language.
- The LLM could also aid in refining the structure of the presentation, suggesting ways to organize the information for maximum impact.
- Additionally, the LLM could help in generating potential questions that the audience might ask, allowing the Sociologist to prepare more thoroughly for the presentation.

Considering these points, the task of presenting research findings at professional meetings could benefit significantly from the use of the LLM in generating content, structuring the presentation, and preparing for potential audience questions. This task falls under the category of E1, as direct access to the LLM could reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality by at least half.
