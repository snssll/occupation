1: In this task, a Park Naturalist is required to research stories regarding the area's natural history or environment. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves researching information related to natural history and the environment, which can be effectively done using the OpenAI large language model (LLM) to access a wide range of sources and generate relevant content.
- The LLM can assist in summarizing existing documents, providing insights, and generating new content based on the input provided.
- The task does not involve any specialized domain knowledge that would require additional software beyond the capabilities of the LLM.
- The LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task by providing quick access to relevant information and assisting in generating content related to the area's natural history.

Based on these considerations, the task of researching stories regarding the area's natural history or environment would fall under label E1 - Direct exposure.
