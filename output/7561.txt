1: In this task, a welder is required to ignite torches or start power supplies and strike arcs by touching electrodes to metals being welded to complete electrical circuits. This task involves physical actions such as igniting torches, starting power supplies, and striking arcs, which cannot be performed by an LLM. The task also requires hands-on skills and expertise in welding techniques, safety procedures, and equipment operation, which are beyond the capabilities of an LLM. Therefore, this task falls under the category of E0 as it does not involve text-based activities that can be automated or assisted by an LLM.
