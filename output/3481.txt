1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of consulting with clients to determine functional or spatial requirements of structures as an architect, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be aided by the use of a large language model (LLM).

- E1: Direct exposure - In this task, an LLM could assist by providing sample questions to ask clients, drafting initial proposals based on client input, or generating reports summarizing client requirements. The LLM could also help in refining communication with clients by suggesting effective ways to gather information. Overall, the LLM could significantly reduce the time needed to prepare for and conduct client consultations.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the task could potentially benefit from additional software that integrates the LLM to summarize client input or provide tailored recommendations based on past projects, the core task of consulting with clients may not see a direct halving of time with just the LLM alone. However, with the development of specialized software, the efficiency of this task could be improved.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities would not significantly impact the task of consulting with clients to determine functional or spatial requirements of structures, as the task primarily involves verbal communication and understanding spatial concepts rather than detailed visual analysis.
