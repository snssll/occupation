1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of collecting wills, burial instructions, and other documentation as a Coroner, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves gathering specific information related to investigations and handling remains, which can be text-based and require understanding and processing written documents. The LLM can assist in tasks such as summarizing documents, providing feedback on documents, and maintaining records of written data. In this case, the LLM can help in organizing and processing the collected information efficiently, potentially reducing the time needed to complete the task.

Considering the nature of the task and the LLM's ability to handle text-based information and assist in document-related tasks, it is likely that the task falls under E1 - Direct exposure. The LLM can significantly aid in processing and organizing the documentation required for investigations, thereby reducing the time needed to complete the task with equivalent quality.
