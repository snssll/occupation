1: In this task, a glazier is responsible for assembling, erecting, or dismantling scaffolds, rigging, or hoisting equipment. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone or with additional software could significantly reduce the time it takes for a glazier to complete this task with equivalent quality. 

- E0: This task involves physical work that cannot be replaced by text-based instructions or information provided by the LLM. Assembling, erecting, or dismantling scaffolds requires hands-on work and precise measurements, which cannot be effectively carried out by the LLM.
- E1: The LLM could potentially provide written instructions or safety guidelines related to assembling scaffolds, rigging, or hoisting equipment. However, the actual physical work of assembling and dismantling would still need to be done manually by the glazier. Therefore, the LLM alone would not reduce the time significantly for completing this task.
- E2: While the LLM could potentially assist in providing safety guidelines, regulations, or best practices related to scaffolding and rigging, there is no software that could be developed on top of the LLM to physically assemble or dismantle scaffolds. The task is highly practical and requires physical skills that cannot be automated.
- E3: The task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images. Therefore, the image capabilities of the LLM would not significantly impact the completion of this task.
