1: In this task, a sheet metal worker is required to install various assemblies in supportive frameworks. This task involves physical work and precise measurements, which cannot be effectively replaced by an LLM. The task does not involve text input or output, and the context is primarily focused on physical installations rather than written instructions or information retrieval. Therefore, the task does not align with the capabilities of the LLM or any tools built on top of it. As a result, this task falls under E0 as it does not benefit from exposure to the LLM.

2: E0
