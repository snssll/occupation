1: In this task, a detective or criminal investigator is required to obtain facts or statements from various individuals involved in a case and record interviews using a recording device. With the help of an LLM, the investigator could potentially benefit from generating interview questions, drafting statements, or summarizing recorded interviews. The LLM could also assist in providing guidance on how to conduct effective interviews or suggest follow-up questions based on the information gathered. Additionally, the LLM could aid in organizing and maintaining records of the interviews conducted. Overall, the LLM could significantly reduce the time it takes to prepare for, conduct, and document interviews, thereby enhancing the efficiency of the investigative process.
