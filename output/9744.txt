1: In this task, a Personal Financial Advisor is required to meet with clients' other advisors to understand their financial goals and circumstances fully. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be significantly aided by the use of the language model. The task involves communication, understanding complex financial information, and building relationships with other professionals. While the LLM can provide information and insights on financial matters, it may not be able to fully replace the interpersonal skills and nuanced understanding required in such meetings. The LLM can assist in preparing for the meetings by providing background information, potential questions to ask, or summarizing relevant financial concepts. However, the core aspect of building trust and understanding clients' unique situations may still heavily rely on human interaction and expertise.
