1: In this task, a Clinical and Counseling Psychologist is required to conduct research to develop or improve diagnostic or therapeutic counseling techniques. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves conducting research, which may require analyzing existing literature, designing studies, collecting data, and interpreting results. The LLM can assist in summarizing existing research, generating new ideas, providing insights, and even helping in writing up findings.
- The LLM can also aid in drafting research proposals, literature reviews, and potentially even in formulating new diagnostic or therapeutic techniques based on the information provided.
- While the LLM can provide valuable information and insights, the task of conducting research involves a high level of expertise, critical thinking, and domain-specific knowledge that the LLM alone may not possess. The psychologist's expertise in interpreting data, understanding human behavior, and applying psychological theories is crucial.
- The LLM can be a valuable tool in the research process, aiding in literature reviews, generating hypotheses, and even assisting in drafting research papers. However, the core work of designing studies, collecting data, analyzing results, and making clinical decisions based on the findings requires human expertise.
