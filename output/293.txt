1: In this task, the Instructional Coordinators are responsible for advising and teaching students. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality. The LLM can assist in providing educational materials, generating lesson plans, answering student questions, and even offering advice on teaching strategies. However, the task of advising and teaching students involves a high degree of human interaction, understanding individual student needs, and providing personalized guidance, which may not be effectively replaced by the LLM alone. While the LLM can provide some support in creating educational content, it may not be able to fully replace the role of an instructional coordinator in advising and teaching students due to the nuanced and personalized nature of this task.
