1: In this task, an interpreter or translator listens to speakers' statements to determine meanings and prepare translations. With the help of an LLM, the interpreter could potentially use the model to assist in real-time translation, provide suggestions for more accurate translations, or even generate translations for certain phrases or sentences. The LLM could also help in looking up specific terms or phrases that the interpreter may not be familiar with. Overall, the LLM could significantly reduce the time it takes to prepare translations and improve the accuracy of the translations.

Considering the task involves text input (spoken words) and text output (translations), the LLM can be directly used to assist in transforming text according to complex instructions, providing edits to existing text, and translating text between languages. Therefore, this task falls under the E1 label as direct access to the LLM can reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality by at least half.
