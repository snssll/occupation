1: For the task of answering questions regarding the store and its merchandise as a Retail Salesperson, the exposure to LLM can be evaluated as follows:

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM can assist in providing scripted responses to common questions about the store and merchandise, saving time and ensuring consistency in answers. It can also help in generating detailed responses based on the information provided about the store's offerings.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time to complete this task, additional software could be developed to create a knowledge base of frequently asked questions and answers, which could streamline the process of responding to inquiries.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not relevant for this task as it primarily involves answering questions about the store and merchandise verbally or in written form.

Based on the above analysis, the task of answering questions regarding the store and its merchandise as a Retail Salesperson would likely fall under E1: Direct exposure.
