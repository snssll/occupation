1: In this task, a Purchasing Manager is responsible for controlling the purchasing department budgets. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be aided by the LLM. 

- **E0**: This task involves managing budgets, which requires a high degree of human judgment and decision-making. While the LLM can provide information and recommendations, the final decisions regarding budget control are typically made based on various factors that may not be solely text-based. The task does not involve specific text-based instructions or data processing that would significantly benefit from LLM assistance.

- **E1**: The LLM could potentially assist in providing information on budgeting best practices, cost-saving strategies, or industry trends related to purchasing. It could also help in drafting budget reports or analyzing data related to departmental spending. However, the core task of controlling the purchasing department budgets involves complex financial considerations and strategic decision-making that may not be easily automated by the LLM alone.

- **E2**: While the LLM could be part of a software system that helps in analyzing budget data, generating budget reports, or providing insights based on financial data, the task of controlling purchasing department budgets likely requires specialized domain knowledge, financial expertise, and real-time data analysis that may go beyond the capabilities of the LLM alone.

- **E3**: This task does not involve image processing or detailed visual information, so the image capabilities of the LLM are not relevant in this context.
