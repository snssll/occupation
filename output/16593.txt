1: In this task, a Residential Advisor is responsible for supervising students' housekeeping work to ensure it is done properly. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality. The task involves overseeing and ensuring the quality of students' housekeeping work, which requires physical presence and interaction with the students. The task does not involve complex text input or output that can be easily handled by the LLM. Therefore, the LLM cannot directly assist in supervising students' housekeeping work as it requires physical presence and interaction, making it unsuitable for automation by the LLM.
