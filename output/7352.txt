1: In this task, a Structural Iron and Steel Worker is required to hold rivets in place while riveters use air hammers to form heads on the rivets. This task involves physical coordination, strength, and precision to ensure the rivets are properly secured. The task does not involve any text input or output, and it is entirely hands-on. As such, there is no direct exposure to the LLM that can reduce the time it takes to complete the task. Additionally, developing software on top of the LLM to perform this task is not feasible as it requires physical interaction and cannot be automated using text-based instructions. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not benefit from LLM capabilities.
