1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of distributing and collecting timecards each pay period as a Payroll and Timekeeping Clerk, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be impacted by the use of the LLM.

- E1: Direct exposure - The task involves a straightforward and repetitive process of distributing and collecting timecards. The LLM can assist in generating reminders, instructions, or templates for communication related to this task. It can also help in drafting emails or messages to employees regarding the submission of timecards. The LLM can streamline the communication process and potentially save time in composing these messages.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to automate the distribution and collection process. This software could potentially integrate with existing payroll systems, automate reminders, track submissions, and generate reports based on the collected data.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not relevant for the task of distributing and collecting timecards, as it primarily involves text-based communication and administrative tasks.

Based on the analysis, the task of distributing and collecting timecards each pay period as a Payroll and Timekeeping Clerk would likely fall under **E1: Direct exposure** as the LLM can assist in streamlining communication related to the task.
