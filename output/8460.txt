1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of interviewing specialists in desired fields to obtain and develop data for park information programs as a Park Naturalist, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be facilitated by the use of a large language model (LLM).

- The task involves conducting interviews with specialists to gather data for park information programs. This task primarily revolves around communication, information gathering, and data synthesis.
- An LLM could assist in preparing questions for the interviews based on the desired fields, refining the collected data into informative content for park programs, and potentially even suggesting follow-up questions or areas to explore during the interviews.
- The LLM could also aid in summarizing the information gathered from the interviews, organizing it into coherent narratives, and generating written content for park information materials.

Considering these points, the task can benefit significantly from the use of an LLM to streamline the data collection and content development process, making it more efficient and effective.
