1: In this task, an air traffic controller needs to check conditions and traffic at different altitudes in response to pilots' requests for altitude changes. With access to the powerful OpenAI large language model (LLM), the controller could potentially use the LLM to gather real-time weather information, traffic conditions, and other relevant data at various altitudes. The LLM could assist in quickly retrieving and analyzing this information to help make informed decisions when responding to pilots' requests. This task involves processing text-based information and making decisions based on that information, which aligns with the capabilities of the LLM. Therefore, the LLM could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality, making it fall under the E1 label.
