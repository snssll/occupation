1: For the task of holding plumb bobs, sighting rods, or other equipment to aid in establishing reference points and lines as a helper to carpenters, the exposure to LLM can be analyzed step by step:

- The task involves physical actions such as holding equipment, which cannot be directly assisted by the LLM.
- The task does not involve complex written or spoken communication that could be significantly aided by the LLM.
- The task does not require accessing specialized knowledge or data that the LLM could provide.
- There is no need for image capabilities to complete the task.

Based on these considerations, the task falls under E0 as it does not meet the criteria for exposure to LLM assistance.
