1: In this task, a personal financial advisor needs to explain their responsibilities and the services they provide to clients. This task involves communicating complex financial information in a clear and understandable manner to clients. With access to the OpenAI large language model (LLM), the advisor could easily generate detailed explanations of their responsibilities and services, tailored to the specific needs of each client. The LLM can help in crafting clear and concise explanations, providing examples, and addressing any questions or concerns the clients may have. Overall, the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to prepare these explanations and ensure they are comprehensive and well-structured.

Considering the task involves writing and transforming text according to complex instructions, providing detailed information, and tailoring responses to individual clients, the direct access to the LLM through an interface like ChatGPT can reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality by at least half. Therefore, this task falls under label E1.
