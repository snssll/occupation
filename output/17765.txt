1: In this task, a barista is responsible for weighing, grinding, or packing coffee beans for customers. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be impacted by the use of the LLM. 

- The task of weighing, grinding, or packing coffee beans for customers is a physical task that involves handling coffee beans and equipment. This task does not involve complex text input or output that would benefit significantly from the use of an LLM.
- The task requires manual labor and physical interaction with the coffee beans and machinery, which cannot be replaced by text-based interactions with the LLM.
- While the LLM could potentially provide information on coffee bean types, brewing methods, or customer preferences, the core task of physically weighing, grinding, or packing coffee beans is not directly impacted by the LLM's capabilities.

Based on these considerations, the task of weighing, grinding, or packing coffee beans for customers is best classified as E0 - No exposure.
