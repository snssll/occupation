1: In this task, a middle school teacher is required to instruct and monitor students in the use and care of equipment and materials to prevent injury and damage. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if the task can be significantly expedited or improved by using the LLM. The task involves hands-on supervision and interaction with students to ensure their safety and proper handling of equipment, which cannot be directly assisted by the LLM. The LLM does not have the capability to physically monitor students or prevent injury in real-time. Therefore, the task does not align with the capabilities of the LLM, and no exposure to the LLM is applicable.
