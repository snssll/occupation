1: In this task, the food science technician is required to supervise other technicians. To complete this task, the technician needs to have knowledge and skills related to food science, as well as leadership and management abilities. The LLM can provide information on food science concepts, guidelines for supervising others, and general advice on leadership. However, the LLM cannot directly supervise other technicians or provide real-time feedback on their work. Therefore, the task does not involve writing or transforming text/code, summarizing documents, or any other text-based activities that the LLM can significantly assist with. Additionally, this task does not involve image capabilities or specialized domain knowledge that the LLM alone can provide. As a result, this task falls under E0 as it does not clearly decrease the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete the task with high quality by at least half.
