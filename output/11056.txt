1: In this task, a Chief Executive is responsible for organizing or approving promotional campaigns. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if direct access to the LLM could significantly reduce the time it takes for a Chief Executive to complete this task with high quality. 

- Direct exposure (E1): Direct access to the LLM could potentially assist in generating ideas for promotional campaigns, drafting promotional materials, or providing insights based on market trends. The LLM could help in brainstorming campaign strategies, drafting campaign messages, or analyzing data to inform campaign decisions. This could streamline the process and enhance the quality of the promotional campaigns.

- Exposure by LLM-powered applications (E2): While the LLM alone may not reduce the time significantly for a Chief Executive to organize or approve promotional campaigns, additional software built on top of the LLM could potentially provide features like analyzing market trends, competitor analysis, or generating detailed campaign reports. Such software could enhance decision-making and streamline the campaign approval process.

- Exposure given image capabilities (E3): Image capabilities would not significantly impact the task of organizing or approving promotional campaigns, as this task primarily involves text-based decision-making and strategic planning rather than image processing.

Considering the above points, the task of organizing or approving promotional campaigns could be best classified as E2 - Exposure by LLM-powered applications.
