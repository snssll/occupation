1: In this task, a surveyor is required to develop criteria for the design and modification of survey instruments. To complete this task, the surveyor would need to have a deep understanding of surveying techniques, instruments, and industry standards. The task involves creating guidelines and specifications for the construction and adjustment of survey instruments to ensure accurate and reliable data collection.

Considering the nature of the task, it involves a high level of domain-specific knowledge and expertise in surveying. While the LLM can provide general information on surveying, it may not have the specialized knowledge required to develop specific criteria for survey instrument design and modification. The task also does not involve text input or output that can be easily processed by the LLM. Therefore, the task does not fall under E1, E2, or E3 exposure categories as the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with high quality.
