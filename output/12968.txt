1: In this task, the Teaching Assistant is required to present subject matter to students under the direction and guidance of teachers. This involves activities such as using lectures, discussions, supervised role-playing methods, or reading aloud. To complete this task, the Teaching Assistant needs to have a good understanding of the subject matter, effective communication skills, and the ability to engage students in the learning process. The LLM could potentially assist in providing additional resources, generating lecture notes, creating discussion prompts, or even helping with the preparation of role-playing scenarios. However, the task also involves a significant amount of human interaction, adapting to the students' responses, and providing real-time feedback, which may not be effectively replaced by the LLM alone.
