1: In this task, a First-Line Supervisor of Non-Retail Sales Workers is required to monitor the performance of sales staff to ensure that goals are met. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- Direct exposure (E1): The task involves monitoring and evaluating the performance of sales staff, which may involve analyzing data, providing feedback, and making decisions based on the information gathered. An LLM could potentially assist in generating reports, analyzing performance metrics, or even suggesting strategies to improve sales staff performance. Therefore, the LLM could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality by providing insights and recommendations based on the data input.

- Exposure by LLM-powered applications (E2): While an LLM alone may not reduce the time it takes to complete the task by half, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to streamline the process further. This software could potentially integrate with existing sales performance tracking systems, provide real-time analytics, or offer personalized recommendations for improving sales staff performance.

- Exposure given image capabilities (E3): Image capabilities are not directly relevant to the task of monitoring sales staff performance, as it primarily involves analyzing data and providing feedback on sales metrics rather than visual information.

Based on the above analysis, the task of monitoring sales staff performance to ensure that goals are met aligns most closely with the E2 label, as additional software built on top of the LLM could further enhance the efficiency of completing this task.
