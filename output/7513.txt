1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of identifying relevant guidance documents, international standards, or consensus standards as a Regulatory Affairs Specialist, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM can assist in completing it. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM can help by providing information on various guidance documents, international standards, and consensus standards based on the input provided. It can search through a vast amount of text data to identify relevant sources quickly and efficiently. The task involves text input and output, which aligns well with the capabilities of the LLM. Therefore, this task could be completed with equivalent quality in less time using the LLM.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone can assist in finding relevant documents, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to summarize and analyze these documents further, providing more insights and recommendations based on the information retrieved. This additional software could enhance the efficiency of the task but may not be necessary for completing it.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not relevant for this task as it primarily involves text-based information retrieval and analysis.

Based on the above analysis, the task of identifying relevant guidance documents, international standards, or consensus standards as a Regulatory Affairs Specialist aligns best with the E1 label, as the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality.
