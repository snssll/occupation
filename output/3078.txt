1: In this task, a mathematician is conducting research to extend mathematical knowledge in traditional areas such as algebra, geometry, probability, and logic. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves conducting research, which may require reading and analyzing a large amount of existing literature, as well as generating new ideas and theories.
- The task involves working in the field of mathematics, which may require a deep understanding of complex mathematical concepts and theories.
- The task may involve writing research papers, formulating hypotheses, and presenting findings in a structured and coherent manner.

Given these considerations, the task of conducting research to extend mathematical knowledge in traditional areas is highly specialized and requires expertise in mathematics. While an LLM can assist with generating text, summarizing information, and providing general information on mathematical concepts, it may not have the specialized domain knowledge required to conduct original research in mathematics.
