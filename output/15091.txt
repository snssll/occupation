1: In this task, a Video Game Designer is required to review or evaluate competitive products, film, music, television, and other art forms to generate new game design ideas. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be significantly enhanced by using the language model. The LLM can assist in providing insights, generating creative ideas, and offering different perspectives based on the input provided about the competitive products, films, music, television, and other art forms. The LLM can help in brainstorming new game design ideas by analyzing and synthesizing information from various sources. However, the task does not involve direct text input-output interactions or require specialized domain knowledge that the LLM alone can provide. Therefore, while the LLM can be a useful tool for research and idea generation, it may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task by at least half.
