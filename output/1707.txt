1: In this task, a Quality Control Analyst is responsible for calibrating, validating, or maintaining laboratory equipment. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- Calibrating, validating, or maintaining laboratory equipment involves technical knowledge, precision, and hands-on work. This task typically requires physical interaction with the equipment, understanding of specific procedures, and troubleshooting skills.
- While an LLM could potentially provide information on general calibration procedures or troubleshooting tips, it cannot physically interact with the equipment or perform the calibration/validation tasks itself.
- The task does not involve writing, summarizing text, or analyzing documents, which are areas where an LLM could significantly reduce time.
- Additionally, this task does not involve image processing or analysis, as it is focused on equipment maintenance rather than visual data.

Based on these considerations, the task of calibrating, validating, or maintaining laboratory equipment would be classified as E0, as it does not align with the capabilities of an LLM or systems built on top of it.

2: E0
