1: In this task, the Heavy and Tractor-Trailer Truck Drivers need to follow appropriate safety procedures for transporting dangerous goods. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality. 

- The task involves understanding and implementing safety procedures, which may require specific regulations, guidelines, and training.
- The LLM can provide general information on safety procedures, but it may not have access to up-to-date regulations or specific details related to transporting dangerous goods.
- While the LLM can provide some general guidance, the task involves practical, hands-on knowledge and adherence to legal requirements that may not be effectively addressed by the LLM alone.
- The task does not involve writing, summarizing, or analyzing text but rather practical application of safety procedures in a real-world setting.

Based on these considerations, the task of following appropriate safety procedures for transporting dangerous goods is best classified as E0 - No exposure.
