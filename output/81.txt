1: In this task, the Cleaning, Washing, and Metal Pickling Equipment Operators and Tenders need to add specified amounts of chemicals to equipment at required times to maintain solution levels and concentrations. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. This task involves a hands-on, physical aspect that requires precise measurements and timing. It does not involve text input or output, complex instructions, or data analysis that could be easily handled by an LLM. The task also does not involve accessing up-to-date information or specialized knowledge that could benefit from LLM capabilities. Therefore, this task does not align with any of the exposure levels in the rubric.
