1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of modifying and customizing commercial programs for internal needs as a Computer User Support Specialist, we need to consider the level of exposure to LLM.

- This task involves working with text-based instructions and code to make changes to existing software programs.
- The LLM can assist in providing guidance on coding, suggesting modifications, and generating code snippets based on the requirements provided.
- The task does not involve highly specialized domain knowledge or complex databases that would require additional software beyond the capabilities of the LLM.
- While the task may benefit from additional software tools tailored specifically for software development, the core task of modifying and customizing programs can be significantly aided by the LLM's text-based capabilities.

Based on these considerations, the task of modifying and customizing commercial programs for internal needs as a Computer User Support Specialist would likely fall under **E1 - Direct exposure** to the LLM.
