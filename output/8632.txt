1: In this task, a Telecommunications Engineering Specialist is required to stay updated on changes in industry practices and emerging telecommunications technology. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be significantly expedited or improved by using the LLM. 

- The task involves reviewing current literature, which could potentially be aided by the LLM in summarizing large amounts of text quickly.
- The LLM could assist in providing up-to-date information on emerging telecommunications technology by accessing recent articles, reports, or research papers.
- It could also help in generating questions or topics for discussion based on the latest trends in the industry.

Considering these points, the task could benefit from the LLM's ability to process and summarize large amounts of text quickly, making the process of staying updated more efficient.
