1: In this task, a sheet metal worker is required to finish parts using tools like hacksaws or shears. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes for a sheet metal worker to complete this task with high quality. Since this task involves physical work with tools and precise measurements, it is unlikely that the LLM or any tool built on top of it can effectively assist in completing the task. The task requires manual dexterity, knowledge of materials, and physical manipulation of tools, which are not within the capabilities of the LLM.
