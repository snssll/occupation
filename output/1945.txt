1: In this task, the Adhesive Bonding Machine Operators and Tenders are required to clean and maintain gluing and cementing machines using various tools and solutions. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if the task can be significantly expedited or improved by using the LLM. 

- The task involves physical actions such as using solutions, lubricants, brushes, and scrapers to clean and maintain machines. These actions cannot be directly performed by the LLM.
- The task does not involve complex decision-making, analysis, or information retrieval that would benefit from the LLM's capabilities.
- The task is straightforward and does not require text input or output that the LLM could assist with.

Based on these considerations, it is clear that the task of cleaning and maintaining gluing and cementing machines does not align with any of the exposure labels (E0, E1, E2, E3) as it does not involve tasks that can be significantly impacted by the LLM.

2: E0

3: High
