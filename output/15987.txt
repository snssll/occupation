1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of "Sketch or draw objects to be crafted" for Craft Artists in terms of exposure to LLM, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM in assisting with this task. 

- The task involves creating visual content, specifically sketches or drawings, which are not text-based. LLMs are primarily text-based models and do not have direct image creation capabilities.
- LLMs can provide text-based descriptions or instructions for creating visual content, but they cannot directly generate images or sketches.
- While LLMs can potentially provide inspiration, ideas, or textual descriptions that could aid in the sketching process, they cannot directly replace the manual skill and creativity required for visual art creation.
- There are no existing LLM-powered applications that can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task of sketching or drawing objects for craft artists.

Based on these considerations, the task of "Sketch or draw objects to be crafted" for Craft Artists would be classified as E0 - No exposure.
