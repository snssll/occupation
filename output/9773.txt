- Writing and transforming text: The LLM can assist in generating meeting agendas, drafting discussion points, or summarizing meeting outcomes.
- Providing feedback on documents: The LLM can help in providing feedback on any written reports or documents related to the rules and regulations discussed.
- Writing and responding to emails: The LLM can assist in drafting emails to staff regarding meeting schedules, follow-ups, or clarifications on rules and regulations.
- Informing anyone of any information via any written or spoken medium: The LLM can be used to inform staff about any updates, changes, or clarifications related to rules and regulations.

Considering the above breakdown, the task can be significantly aided by the LLM in various aspects, such as generating meeting agendas, drafting emails, providing feedback, and informing staff.
