1: In this task, the occupation involves cutting and trimming materials using various hand tools. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be significantly expedited or improved by using the language model. Since the task involves physical manipulation of materials and tools, it does not directly align with the capabilities of the LLM, which is primarily text-based. The LLM cannot physically route items or operate tools. Therefore, there is no direct application of the LLM in this task.
