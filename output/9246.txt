1: In this task, the main responsibilities include maintaining order and ensuring adherence to safety rules in venues such as theaters, stadiums, or event spaces. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if the task can be significantly aided by the use of the LLM. The task of maintaining order and enforcing safety rules primarily involves human interaction, observation, and quick decision-making based on real-time situations. While the LLM could potentially provide general guidelines or safety protocols, the core of the task relies heavily on physical presence, communication skills, and immediate responses to dynamic situations. The LLM cannot physically enforce safety rules or maintain order in a venue, making it unsuitable for directly assisting with this task.
