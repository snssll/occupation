1: In this task, the School Bus Monitor is responsible for guiding the bus driver when the bus is moving in reverse gear. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if access to the LLM or LLM-powered tools can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality by at least half.

Given the nature of the task, which involves physical guidance and coordination between the bus monitor and the driver, it is clear that the task cannot be completed using text-based instructions or information provided by the LLM. The task requires real-time communication, observation, and physical presence to ensure the safety of the passengers and the vehicle. Therefore, the LLM or LLM-powered tools cannot be used to complete this task effectively.
