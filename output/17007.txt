1: In this task, the occupation involves shuttle drivers, chauffeurs, and taxi drivers who are responsible for testing vehicle equipment to ensure proper operation. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if the task can be significantly aided by the use of the LLM. The task itself is very hands-on and requires physical interaction with the vehicle's equipment, such as lights, brakes, horns, and windshield wipers. Since this task involves practical testing and inspection of physical components, it does not lend itself well to automation or assistance from an LLM. The LLM cannot physically interact with the vehicle or test its equipment, making it unsuitable for this task.
