1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of interviewing or corresponding with agents and claimants as a Claims Adjuster, Examiner, or Investigator, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be supported by the capabilities of the LLM.

- Claims adjustment, examination, and investigation involve a significant amount of written communication, such as interviewing and corresponding with various parties to gather information, correct errors, and investigate claims.
- The LLM can assist in drafting emails, letters, or other written correspondence by providing suggested responses, language refinement, or even generating questions to ask during interviews.
- The LLM can also help in summarizing information gathered from interviews or correspondence, maintaining records of written data, and potentially providing insights or recommendations based on the information processed.
- While the LLM can enhance the efficiency and accuracy of written communication tasks, it may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task by at least half, as the core of the task involves human interaction and decision-making based on gathered information.
