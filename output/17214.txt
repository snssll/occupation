1: In this task, the First-Line Supervisors of Landscaping, Lawn Service, and Groundskeeping Workers are responsible for training workers in various landscaping tasks. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task. The task involves practical, hands-on training that requires physical demonstration and interaction. While the LLM can provide information on landscaping techniques, it cannot replace the hands-on training aspect of this task. Therefore, the task does not fall under E1, E2, or E3 as the LLM cannot directly assist in training workers in practical tasks like transplanting trees or using equipment.

2: E0

3: High
