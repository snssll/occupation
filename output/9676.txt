1: In this task, an Aircraft Mechanic or Service Technician is required to measure parts for wear using precision instruments. This task involves precise measurements that require human judgment and expertise. The task does not involve text input or output that can be easily processed by an LLM. The LLM does not have the capability to physically measure parts or interpret the data obtained from precision instruments. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM or any tools built on top of it.
