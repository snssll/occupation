1: In this task, a Forensic Science Technician is required to measure and sketch crime scenes to document evidence. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone or with additional software could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality.

- E0: This task involves precise measurements and detailed sketching of crime scenes, which are physical actions that cannot be performed by the LLM or any software built on top of it. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not involve text-based work that can be significantly expedited by the LLM.

2: E0
