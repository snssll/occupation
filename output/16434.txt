1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of submitting evidence as a Police Identification and Records Officer, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it. 

- E0: This task involves physical handling of evidence and legal procedures that likely require human judgment and interaction. The task may also involve specific protocols and chain of custody requirements that cannot be fully automated by the LLM.

- E1: The LLM could potentially assist in drafting reports or documentation related to the evidence submission process. It could help in summarizing information, drafting emails, or providing feedback on written documents. However, the core task of physically submitting evidence and ensuring its proper handling likely cannot be significantly expedited by the LLM.

- E2: While the LLM could potentially be used to retrieve information or provide recommendations related to evidence submission procedures, the task itself is highly specialized and involves legal nuances that may not be easily automated by the LLM alone. Additional software specifically tailored to law enforcement procedures and legal requirements would be needed to significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task.

- E3: The task of submitting evidence does not involve image processing or creation, so the image capabilities of the LLM would not significantly impact the completion of this task.
