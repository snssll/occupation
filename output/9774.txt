1: In this task, an interviewer meets with their supervisor daily to submit completed assignments and discuss progress. This task involves regular communication and reporting to the supervisor. With the help of an LLM, the interviewer could potentially draft reports, summaries, or updates to share with the supervisor. The LLM could assist in generating these written materials efficiently based on the information provided by the interviewer. The LLM could also help in formulating questions or responses that the interviewer might need during these meetings. Overall, the LLM could streamline the process of preparing for and participating in these daily meetings, saving time and effort for the interviewer.

Considering the nature of the task and the potential for the LLM to assist in generating written materials and responses, I would classify this task as E1 - Direct exposure.
