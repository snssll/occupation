1: In this task, a Diagnostic Medical Sonographer is required to coordinate work with physicians or other healthcare team members, including providing assistance during invasive procedures. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be significantly aided by the use of the language model. 

- The task involves coordination with healthcare team members and providing assistance during invasive procedures, which requires hands-on skills and real-time decision-making.
- The task involves physical presence and interaction with other healthcare professionals, which cannot be replaced by text-based interactions with an LLM.
- The task involves real-time responses and actions that are critical for patient care, which cannot be effectively performed by an LLM.

Based on these considerations, it is evident that the task of coordinating work with physicians and providing assistance during invasive procedures in the field of Diagnostic Medical Sonography is not suitable for automation or assistance by an LLM. Therefore, the appropriate label for this task is E0.
