1: In this task, the Fast Food and Counter Worker serves customers in eating places that specialize in fast service and inexpensive carry-out food. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality. 

- E0: This task involves direct human interaction and physical actions such as serving customers, which cannot be replaced by the LLM. The LLM cannot physically serve customers or interact with them in person, so it cannot significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task.

- E1: The LLM could potentially assist in providing written instructions or scripts for customer interactions, handling written communication like emails or documentation related to the job, or even generating training materials for new employees. However, the core task of serving customers in a fast food setting involves direct human interaction, which the LLM cannot perform.

- E2: While the LLM could potentially be used to generate training materials, analyze customer feedback, or provide insights on improving service quality based on written data, the direct customer service aspect of this task cannot be significantly impacted by the LLM alone.

- E3: The task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images, so the image capabilities of the LLM are not relevant here.

2: E0

3: High
