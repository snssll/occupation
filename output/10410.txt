1: In this task, an Audio and Video Technician is required to notify supervisors when major equipment repairs are needed. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality.

- Direct exposure (E1): The task involves straightforward communication of information, which the LLM can assist with by drafting clear and concise notifications to supervisors about equipment repairs. The LLM can help in composing the messages effectively, potentially reducing the time needed to convey the information accurately.

- Exposure by LLM-powered applications (E2): While the LLM can aid in drafting the notifications, there may not be additional software beyond the LLM that significantly enhances the completion of this task. The task is relatively straightforward and does not require specialized domain knowledge or complex data analysis that would benefit from additional software.

- Exposure given image capabilities (E3): Image capabilities are not relevant to this task as it primarily involves written communication about equipment repairs, without the need for image processing or analysis.

Considering the above points, the task of notifying supervisors when major equipment repairs are needed aligns best with E1 - Direct exposure.

2: E1
