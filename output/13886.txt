1: In this task, a Counter and Rental Clerk is required to recommend and provide advice on a wide variety of products and services to customers. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality. The task involves understanding customer needs, product knowledge, and providing personalized recommendations, which may require human judgment, empathy, and real-time interaction. While the LLM can provide general information about products and services, it may not have the ability to understand nuanced customer preferences, emotions, or provide real-time personalized advice. Therefore, the task does not seem to be easily reducible to text-based interactions with the LLM alone.
