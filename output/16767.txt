1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of teaching acting classes as a Talent Director, we need to consider how the task can be completed with the help of an LLM. 

- E0: This task involves direct human interaction and physical presence, which cannot be replaced by an LLM. Teaching acting classes requires hands-on guidance, feedback, and interaction with students, which an LLM cannot provide.

- E1: While an LLM could potentially assist in creating lesson plans, providing theoretical knowledge, or generating exercises for acting classes, the core aspect of teaching, which involves practical demonstrations, feedback on performances, and personalized coaching, cannot be effectively replaced by an LLM. Therefore, the time saved by using an LLM for this task would not be significant, and the quality of teaching would likely be compromised.

- E2: It is conceivable that software could be developed on top of an LLM to assist Talent Directors in creating lesson plans, generating exercises, or providing theoretical knowledge related to acting classes. However, the essential elements of teaching acting, such as hands-on guidance, personalized feedback, and practical demonstrations, would still require human intervention. The time saved by using such software may not be substantial enough to warrant a label of E1.

- E3: Image capabilities would not significantly impact the task of teaching acting classes, as the core of this task involves verbal and physical interaction with students rather than visual content. Therefore, image capabilities would not provide a significant reduction in the time it takes to complete this task.
