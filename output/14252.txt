1: In this task, a Telecommunications Equipment Installer and Repairer needs to refer to manufacturers' manuals to obtain maintenance instructions for specific malfunctions. With access to the powerful OpenAI large language model (LLM), the worker can potentially input the specific malfunction details and receive relevant maintenance instructions or troubleshooting steps from the model. The LLM can assist in interpreting and summarizing the information provided in the manuals, making it easier for the worker to locate the necessary instructions quickly. This task involves text input (malfunction details) and text output (maintenance instructions), which aligns well with the capabilities of the LLM in providing information and guidance based on the input data.
