1: In this task, the Court, Municipal, and License Clerks are required to question applicants to gather necessary information like name, address, or age, and then record this data on specific forms. With the help of an LLM, the process of questioning applicants could potentially be streamlined by providing suggested questions based on the context of the application form. The LLM could assist in generating a list of relevant questions to ask applicants based on the required information, thus saving time for the clerks. Additionally, the LLM could help in drafting the prescribed forms or even auto-populating certain fields based on the responses obtained during questioning. Overall, the LLM could significantly enhance the efficiency of the data collection and recording process in this task.
