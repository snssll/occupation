1: For the task of providing customers with product details as a barista, the exposure to LLM can be evaluated as follows:

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM can assist in generating detailed product descriptions, coffee blend information, and preparation methods based on the input provided. It can help in crafting engaging and informative descriptions to share with customers.
- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time to complete this task, additional software could be developed to streamline the process further. This could involve creating a database of product details that the LLM can access and generate descriptions from.
- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not relevant for this task as it primarily involves providing text-based information to customers.

Based on the above analysis, the task of providing customers with product details as a barista aligns best with label E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications.
