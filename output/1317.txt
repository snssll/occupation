1: In this task, the ophthalmic medical technician assists patients in inserting or removing contact lenses. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes for an ophthalmic medical technician to complete this task with high quality. 

Assisting patients in inserting or removing contact lenses involves physical interaction and precise movements that cannot be performed by the LLM or any software tool. The task requires hands-on assistance and direct human interaction, which cannot be replaced by text-based AI models. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not meet the criteria for exposure to LLM capabilities.

2: E0

3: High
