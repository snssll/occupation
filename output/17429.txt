1: In this task, a Tool Grinder, Filer, and Sharpener is responsible for turning valves to direct the flow of coolant against cutting wheels and workpieces during grinding. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. This task involves physical actions such as turning valves, which cannot be directly performed by an LLM. The task also requires hands-on manipulation of machinery and equipment, which is not within the capabilities of the LLM. As a result, this task falls under the E0 category as it involves physical actions that cannot be automated or assisted by the LLM.
