1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of dressing mannequins for displays as a Merchandise Displayer and Window Trimmer, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves physically dressing mannequins to create visually appealing displays. This task does not involve text input or output, and the context is primarily visual and tactile.
