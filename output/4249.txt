1: In this task, an Occupational Therapy Aide is required to demonstrate therapy techniques, including manual and creative arts and games. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider whether access to the LLM alone or with additional software could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality.

- E0: This task involves physical demonstrations of therapy techniques, which cannot be performed by the LLM or any software tool. Therefore, this task does not fit into any of the categories where LLM exposure would reduce the time to complete the task.

- E1: The task of demonstrating therapy techniques, especially manual ones, requires physical interaction and demonstration, which cannot be replaced by text-based instructions or responses from the LLM. Therefore, direct access to the LLM would not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task.

- E2: While it's conceivable that software could be developed to provide guidance or information on therapy techniques, the actual demonstration part of the task would still require physical presence and interaction. Thus, the time to complete the task would not be halved by LLM-powered applications.

- E3: Image capabilities would not significantly impact the completion of this task as it involves physical demonstrations rather than image processing or creation.

2: E0
