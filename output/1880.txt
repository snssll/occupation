1: In this task, a Computer Numerically Controlled (CNC) Tool Operator is responsible for checking that workpieces are properly lubricated and cooled during machine operation. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

For this specific task, the CNC Tool Operator needs to visually inspect the workpieces to ensure they are adequately lubricated and cooled. This task involves manual observation and assessment, which does not directly align with the capabilities of the LLM. The LLM cannot physically inspect the workpieces or assess their lubrication and cooling status. While the LLM could potentially provide information on best practices for lubrication and cooling, it cannot directly perform the task of physically checking the workpieces.
