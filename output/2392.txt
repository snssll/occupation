1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of collecting historical cost data to estimate costs for current or future products as a Cost Estimator, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves gathering data, analyzing it, and making estimations based on historical information. The LLM can assist in providing information on cost estimation methodologies, industry trends, and general guidance on how to approach cost estimation. It can also help in summarizing complex cost data and providing insights based on the input provided. However, the task does not involve direct text input-output interactions that the LLM excels at, such as writing, summarizing documents, or answering specific questions. While the LLM can provide some support in terms of information retrieval and general guidance, it may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task by half.
