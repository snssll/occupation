1: In this task, a Costume Attendant is responsible for checking the appearance of costumes on stage or under lights to ensure that the desired effects are being achieved. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider whether access to the LLM or LLM-powered tools would significantly reduce the time it takes for a Costume Attendant to complete this task with high quality.

- Direct exposure (E1): The task of checking the appearance of costumes on stage is primarily a visual inspection task that requires physical presence and observation. While the LLM could potentially provide information on costume design or historical context, it cannot physically inspect the costumes on stage or under lights. Therefore, direct access to the LLM would not reduce the time it takes to complete this task significantly.

- Exposure by LLM-powered applications (E2): It is challenging to imagine additional software built on top of the LLM that could automate the visual inspection of costumes on stage or under lights. The task is highly practical and requires human judgment based on visual observation, which is not easily replicable by software. Therefore, access to the LLM alone would not lead to a significant reduction in time for this task.

- Exposure given image capabilities (E3): While image capabilities could potentially assist in capturing images of the costumes on stage, they would not be able to replace the human judgment required to determine whether the desired effects are being achieved. The task involves subjective evaluation of visual appearance, which is beyond the capabilities of image processing tools.

Based on the above analysis, the task of checking the appearance of costumes on stage or under lights is best classified as E0, as access to the LLM or LLM-powered tools would not significantly reduce the time it takes for a Costume Attendant to complete this task with high quality.

2: E0

3: Certainty level: High
