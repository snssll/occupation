1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of compiling, administering, and grading examinations (or assigning this work to others) for postsecondary teachers in various disciplines, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves creating and evaluating assessments, which can be time-consuming and require attention to detail. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM can assist in generating exam questions, providing feedback on exam content, and potentially automating parts of the grading process. This can significantly reduce the time required to compile and administer exams, especially for routine tasks like grading multiple-choice questions.
- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not reduce the time by half for this task, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to streamline the exam creation and grading process further. This software could include features like automatically generating exam questions based on specific criteria or analyzing student responses for grading.
- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not directly relevant to the task of compiling, administering, and grading examinations, so this label does not apply.

Considering the above points, the task of compiling, administering, and grading examinations for postsecondary teachers is best classified as E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications.

2: E2

3: Moderate
