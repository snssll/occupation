1: In this task, the helper-production worker needs to signal their coworkers to direct them to move products during the production process. This task involves communication and coordination within a production environment. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone or with additional software could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task. 

- E0: This task involves physical actions and real-time communication that cannot be replaced by text-based interactions with the LLM. The LLM cannot physically signal coworkers or direct the movement of products.
- E1: The LLM could potentially help in generating written instructions or communication scripts for signaling coworkers, but it cannot physically signal or direct movements. The task requires real-time interaction and physical presence, which the LLM cannot provide.
- E2: While additional software could potentially be developed to assist with communication or coordination in a production environment, the real-time nature of the task and the need for physical actions make it challenging to significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task by half.
- E3: The task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images, so the image capabilities of the LLM are not relevant here.

Based on the above analysis, the most appropriate label for this task is E0.

2: E0

3: High
