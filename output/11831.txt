1: In this task, a Nuclear Monitoring Technician is responsible for handling radioactive waste by placing it into containers for shipping or disposal. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM or LLM-powered tools can significantly reduce the time it takes for a Nuclear Monitoring Technician to complete this task with high quality.

- E0: This task involves physical handling of radioactive waste, which requires specific training, safety protocols, and adherence to regulations. The task does not involve text-based work that can be easily automated or assisted by the LLM.

- E1: While the LLM could potentially provide information on regulations, safety protocols, or guidelines related to handling radioactive waste, the actual physical task of placing the waste into containers for shipping or disposal cannot be directly assisted by the LLM. The expertise and training required for this task are not text-based and involve practical, hands-on skills.

- E2: It is challenging to imagine additional software built on top of the LLM that could significantly reduce the time it takes to physically handle radioactive waste. The task is highly specialized, involves safety considerations, and requires practical skills that cannot be easily automated through text-based tools.

- E3: The task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images. The nature of the task is more focused on physical handling rather than visual or text-based processing that could benefit from image capabilities.
