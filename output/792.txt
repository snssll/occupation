1: Music therapists are professionals who use music interventions to help individuals achieve specific therapeutic goals. The task provided, "Apply current technology to music therapy practices," involves incorporating modern technology into their therapeutic sessions. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider whether access to the LLM alone or additional software built on top of the LLM could significantly reduce the time it takes for a music therapist to integrate technology into their practice.

- E0: This task involves hands-on application of technology in a therapeutic setting, which may require human interaction, precise measurements, and real-time adjustments based on individual client needs. The use of an LLM or LLM-powered tool may not substantially reduce the time it takes for a music therapist to effectively apply technology in music therapy practices.

- E1: While the LLM could potentially provide information on current technology trends in music therapy, the actual application of technology in therapy sessions may involve nuanced decisions, client interactions, and real-time adjustments that go beyond the capabilities of the LLM alone. Therefore, the direct access to the LLM may not significantly reduce the time needed for a music therapist to apply technology in their practice.

- E2: It is conceivable that additional software built on top of the LLM could be developed to assist music therapists in integrating technology into their practice more efficiently. This software could potentially provide recommendations on technology selection, best practices for implementation, or even virtual simulations of therapy sessions using technology. Such tools could enhance the therapist's ability to leverage technology effectively in their sessions.

- E3: Given the nature of the task, which involves applying technology in a therapeutic context, the use of image capabilities alongside the LLM may not significantly impact the time it takes for a music therapist to carry out this task. Image capabilities are unlikely to play a crucial role in the integration of technology into music therapy practices.
