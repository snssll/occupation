1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of attaching moving parts and subassemblies to a basic assembly unit as a Millwright, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be impacted by the use of the LLM. In this task, the key actions involve physical manipulation of parts and the use of hand tools and power tools, which cannot be directly replaced by the LLM. The task does not involve text-based inputs or outputs that the LLM could significantly assist with. Therefore, the task does not align with any of the exposure levels in the rubric.
