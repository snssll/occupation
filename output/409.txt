1: In this task, a General Internal Medicine Physician is required to advise a surgeon on a patient's risk status and recommend appropriate interventions to minimize risk. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves analyzing medical information, assessing risk factors, and providing recommendations based on medical knowledge and expertise. An LLM could potentially assist in providing general information on risk factors and interventions based on existing medical literature and guidelines. However, the task also requires specialized medical knowledge and expertise that may not be fully captured by the LLM. The LLM may not have access to the most up-to-date patient-specific information or the ability to interpret complex medical data accurately. Therefore, while the LLM could provide some general information, the task requires a high level of specialized medical expertise and human judgment, making it less suitable for automation.
