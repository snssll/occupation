1: In this task, a Court Reporter or Simultaneous Captioner is required to file a legible transcript of records of a court case with the court clerk's office. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves transcribing spoken words accurately into a written format, which is a task that can be significantly aided by the use of a large language model (LLM) like OpenAI's model. The LLM can assist in transcribing the spoken words into text efficiently and accurately.
- The task does not involve any visual elements or detailed images that would require image capabilities.
- While the task may not be reduced by half in terms of time with just direct access to the LLM, it is easy to imagine additional software that could be developed on top of the LLM to further streamline the transcription process, potentially reducing the time significantly.

Based on these considerations, the task falls under label E2 - Exposure by LLM-powered applications.

2: E2

3: Moderate
