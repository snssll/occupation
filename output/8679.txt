1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of keeping records of assigned cases and preparing required reports as an Eligibility Interviewer for Government Programs, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be impacted by the use of a large language model (LLM).

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** If the task involves writing and transforming text, providing edits to existing text, maintaining records, or preparing reports based on specific guidelines, the LLM could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete these tasks with equivalent quality. The LLM can assist in organizing and summarizing information, generating reports, and ensuring accuracy in record-keeping.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the LLM alone may not reduce the time by half for this task, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to streamline the process further. This software could potentially automate data entry, extract relevant information from records, and generate reports more efficiently.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Since the task primarily involves text-based activities like record-keeping and report preparation, image capabilities would not significantly impact the completion time or quality of this task.
