1: In this task of providing assistance in the training and orientation of new cashiers as a Gambling Cage Worker, the exposure to LLM can be evaluated as follows:

- E1: Direct exposure - The task involves a lot of written communication and instruction, which can be efficiently handled by the LLM. The model can assist in creating training materials, writing instructions, and providing information to new cashiers.
- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the task may not require highly specialized domain knowledge that the LLM alone can provide, additional software could be developed to streamline the training process further by incorporating interactive modules, quizzes, or simulations.
- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - This task does not involve image processing or detailed visual instructions, so image capabilities are not necessary for completing this task.

Based on the above analysis, the task of providing assistance in the training and orientation of new cashiers as a Gambling Cage Worker aligns most closely with E1: Direct exposure.
