1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of developing new business by contacting potential clients, making sales presentations, and writing proposals as an Industrial-Organizational Psychologist, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. In this case, the task involves a significant amount of human interaction, negotiation, and sales skills, which are not directly related to the text-based capabilities of the LLM. While the LLM could potentially assist in drafting written proposals or providing information on best practices in sales presentations, the core aspects of client interaction and salesmanship require human expertise and judgment. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not significantly benefit from the text-based capabilities of the LLM.
