1: In this task, the Transit and Railroad Police are required to interview neighbors, associates, or former employers of job applicants to verify personal references or obtain work history data. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we can break down the task:
- The task involves interacting with individuals to gather information, which requires human judgment and communication skills.
- The task does not involve writing or transforming text/code, summarizing documents, or providing feedback on documents, which are typical tasks where LLMs excel.
- While an LLM could potentially assist in drafting interview questions or analyzing responses, the core of the task involves human interaction and judgment, which an LLM cannot fully replicate.
