1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of maintaining a knowledge base of existing and emerging regulations, standards, or guidance documents as a Regulatory Affairs Specialist, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could assist in completing it. 

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** The task involves staying up-to-date with regulations and standards, which could benefit from the LLM's ability to process and summarize large amounts of text quickly. The LLM could assist in summarizing new regulations, comparing them to existing ones, and highlighting key changes. This would significantly reduce the time it takes to stay informed about regulatory updates.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the LLM alone can help with summarizing and processing text, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to create a more specialized tool for Regulatory Affairs Specialists. This tool could automatically scan and extract relevant information from regulatory documents, provide analysis on the impact of new regulations, and even suggest compliance strategies based on the data processed by the LLM.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Image capabilities would not be directly relevant to this task as it primarily involves text-based documents related to regulations and standards.
