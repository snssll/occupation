1: In this task, a Shoe and Leather Worker and Repairer is required to make, modify, and repair orthopedic or therapeutic footwear based on doctors' prescriptions or modify existing footwear for individuals with foot problems and special needs. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves a high level of manual skill and craftsmanship, as it requires working with physical materials like leather and various tools to create custom footwear. The task also involves interpreting doctors' prescriptions and understanding the specific needs of individuals with foot problems. While the LLM can provide information on orthopedic footwear and therapeutic techniques, it cannot physically create or repair footwear. Therefore, the task does not involve text-based activities that the LLM can significantly assist with. As a result, this task falls under E0 as it does not benefit from direct exposure to the LLM.
