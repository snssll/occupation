1: In this task, the Agricultural Inspectors are responsible for setting labeling standards and approving labels for meat or poultry products. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves writing and transforming text (labeling standards, labels) according to specific guidelines and regulations.
- The task may require some level of domain-specific knowledge related to agricultural practices and food safety regulations.
- The task does not involve complex visual analysis or detailed image editing.
- The task does not require accessing up-to-date facts from the internet.
- The task does not involve highly specialized domain knowledge beyond agricultural and food safety regulations.

Based on these considerations, the task falls under E0 as it does not significantly benefit from direct access to the LLM or additional software beyond what is commonly available for writing and document management.
