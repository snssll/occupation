1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of entering local environmental data into decision tools, we need to consider the level of exposure to LLM. In this task, the main actions involve inputting data and using decision tools to analyze and identify appropriate techniques. The LLM could potentially assist in providing guidance on which analyses or techniques to use based on the input data. This task does not involve complex visual analysis, precise measurements, or human interaction, making it suitable for automation with text-based tools like the LLM. The LLM could help in interpreting the data and suggesting relevant analyses, which aligns with tasks that can be completed with text input and output.
