1: In this task, a database administrator is required to review procedures in database management system manuals to make changes to the database. With access to the powerful OpenAI large language model (LLM), the administrator can quickly search for specific procedures, understand them, and identify the necessary changes to be made in the database. The LLM can assist in interpreting complex technical information, providing insights on best practices, and suggesting efficient ways to implement changes. The model can also help in documenting the modifications made for future reference. Overall, the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes for a database administrator to review procedures and make changes in the database with high quality.
