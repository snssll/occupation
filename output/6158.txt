1: In this task, a Computer, Automated Teller, and Office Machine Repairer is required to enter information into computers to copy programs or to draw, modify, or store schematics. With the help of the LLM, the repairer could potentially receive guidance on specific steps to follow when copying programs or creating schematics. The LLM could provide detailed instructions, troubleshoot common issues, or suggest alternative methods for storing schematics. However, since this task involves hands-on work with electronic components and machines, the LLM alone cannot physically perform the task. Therefore, the LLM can only provide theoretical guidance and information, but the actual execution of the task still requires manual work.
