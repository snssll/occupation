1: In this task, the Architectural and Civil Drafters are required to produce drawings using computer-assisted drafting systems (CAD) or drafting machines. The task involves creating detailed technical drawings that require precision and accuracy. While an LLM could potentially assist in providing information on drafting techniques, tools, or standards, it cannot directly replace the need for CAD software or drafting machines to create the drawings. The task involves technical skills and specialized knowledge in drafting that go beyond the capabilities of the LLM. Therefore, the task does not fall under E1, E2, or E3 exposure categories as the LLM alone cannot significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with high quality.
