1: In this task, a Customs Broker is responsible for preparing papers for shippers to appeal duty charges. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves writing and transforming text according to specific instructions, which is a task that can be efficiently handled by the LLM.
- The LLM can assist in drafting the necessary documents, providing guidance on the appeal process, and ensuring that the paperwork is accurate and well-written.
- While the task may require some domain-specific knowledge related to customs regulations, the LLM can still provide valuable support in generating the required content.
- The task does not involve precise measurements, detailed visuals, or physical interactions, making it suitable for automation through text-based AI tools.

Based on these considerations, the task of preparing papers for shippers to appeal duty charges would likely fall under the E1 label, as direct access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality.
