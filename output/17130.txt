1: In this task, the Wind Turbine Service Technicians are responsible for training end-users, distributors, installers, or other technicians in wind commissioning, testing, or other technical procedures. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality. The task involves conveying technical information and procedures to others, which could potentially benefit from the LLM's ability to generate training materials based on general knowledge. The LLM could assist in creating detailed and informative training materials, instructions, or documentation for the training sessions. Therefore, this task could be categorized as E1 if the LLM can efficiently generate training materials or instructions.

2: E1

3: Moderate
