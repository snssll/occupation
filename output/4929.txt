1: In this task, a Demonstrator and Product Promoter is required to develop lists of prospective clients from various sources. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we can break down the task:
- The task involves gathering information from sources like newspaper items, company records, local merchants, or customers.
- The task requires organizing this information into lists of prospective clients.

Given the nature of the task, it involves data collection, organization, and potentially some analysis. An LLM could assist in generating lists based on the provided sources, organizing the information, and potentially even suggesting additional sources for prospecting.
