1: Legal secretaries and administrative assistants often handle tasks related to scheduling, organizing, and coordinating activities for attorneys. Making travel arrangements for attorneys is a common responsibility in this role. To determine the appropriate label for this task's exposure to LLM, we can consider the following:

- Legal secretaries and administrative assistants typically rely on written communication to arrange travel, which can be effectively handled by an LLM through written instructions and responses.
- The task of making travel arrangements involves coordinating details such as flight bookings, hotel reservations, and transportation, which can be managed through text-based interactions with the LLM.
- While the task may involve some level of decision-making based on preferences and schedules, the core components of arranging travel can be supported by the LLM's ability to process and generate text-based information.

Based on these considerations, it is reasonable to conclude that this task falls under E1, as the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality by handling text-based interactions related to making travel arrangements for attorneys.
