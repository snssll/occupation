1: In this task, a Marketing Manager is required to confer with legal staff to resolve problems related to copyright infringement or royalty sharing with outside producers or distributors. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves understanding legal concepts such as copyright infringement and royalty sharing, which may require specialized domain knowledge.
- The task also involves communication and negotiation skills to work with legal staff to resolve these issues.
- While the task involves written communication, it primarily focuses on legal and business aspects rather than generating text or code.
- The task does not involve image capabilities or require accessing up-to-date facts from the internet.

Based on these considerations, the task falls under E0 as it does not clearly benefit from direct access to the LLM or any additional software that could significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced Marketing Manager to complete the task.
