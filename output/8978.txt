1: In this task, a Petroleum Pump System Operator, Refinery Operator, or Gauger is required to lower thermometers into tanks to obtain temperature readings. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it. 

- E0: This task involves physical interaction with equipment (lowering thermometers into tanks) and obtaining temperature readings, which cannot be directly assisted by the LLM or any LLM-powered tools. The task does not involve complex data analysis or decision-making that could benefit significantly from LLM capabilities.

- E1: While the LLM could potentially provide information on temperature readings or general guidance on the process of obtaining temperature readings, the physical aspect of lowering thermometers into tanks cannot be directly assisted by the LLM. The task does not involve complex instructions, writing, or data analysis that would significantly benefit from LLM capabilities.

- E2: It is challenging to imagine additional software built on top of the LLM that could reduce the time it takes to complete the task of lowering thermometers into tanks to obtain temperature readings. The task is straightforward and does not involve extensive data analysis or decision-making that would require specialized LLM-powered tools.

- E3: The task does not involve image capabilities, reading text from PDFs, or creating/editing digital images, so exposure to image capabilities would not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task.

2: E0

3: High
