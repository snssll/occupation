1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of testing the security and performance of blockchain infrastructures as a Blockchain Engineer, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM can assist in writing reports, analyzing data, and providing insights related to blockchain technology and security. It can help in summarizing information, generating test cases, and even suggesting potential vulnerabilities to investigate further.
- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time it takes to test the security and performance of blockchain infrastructures, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to automate certain aspects of testing, such as generating test scenarios based on input parameters or analyzing large amounts of data for potential security risks.
- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not relevant for the task of testing blockchain infrastructures, as it primarily involves working with code, data, and system configurations rather than visual information.

Considering the above points, the task of testing the security and performance of blockchain infrastructures as a Blockchain Engineer would likely fall under **E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications**.
