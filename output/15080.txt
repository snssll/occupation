1: In this task, a Compensation, Benefits, and Job Analysis Specialist is required to review occupational data on Alien Employment Certification Applications to determine the appropriate occupational title and code, and provide local offices with information about immigration and occupations. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

Given that the task involves reviewing occupational data and providing information about immigration and occupations, it is likely that the task can be significantly aided by the use of the LLM. The LLM can assist in analyzing and interpreting the data, identifying relevant information, and generating reports or summaries based on the input provided. The model can help in understanding complex information and generating insights that can be useful for local offices.

Considering the complexity of the task and the potential for the LLM to assist in data analysis, interpretation, and report generation, it is reasonable to assign this task the label of E1. Direct access to the LLM can reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality by at least half.
