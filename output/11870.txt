1: In this task, a Compensation and Benefits Manager is responsible for planning and conducting new-employee orientations to foster a positive attitude toward organizational objectives. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be significantly aided by the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves creating content and delivering it in a way that engages new employees and aligns them with the organization's goals. While the LLM can assist in generating text-based content, it may not significantly reduce the time it takes to plan and conduct the orientation, as this task involves human interaction, understanding organizational culture, and tailoring the orientation to specific employee needs. Therefore, the task does not fall under E1, as the LLM alone may not reduce the time significantly. Additionally, while it's conceivable that software could be developed to help with aspects of orientation planning, such as generating materials or quizzes, the core task of fostering a positive attitude through personal interaction is not easily automated. Hence, it does not fit under E2 either. Since the task does not involve image capabilities, it also does not fall under E3. Therefore, the most appropriate label for this task is E0.

2: E0

3: Moderate
