1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of conducting presentations on research findings as an Industrial-Organizational Psychologist, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it more efficiently.

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM could assist in writing and transforming text for the presentation, providing edits to existing content, generating questions for the audience, or even summarizing research findings. It could also help in preparing training materials based on general knowledge related to the research findings. Overall, the LLM could significantly reduce the time needed to prepare for the presentation and enhance the quality of the content.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone could be helpful in generating content for the presentation, additional software could be developed to summarize longer research documents, retrieve up-to-date facts to incorporate into the presentation, or provide specialized domain knowledge related to the research findings. Such software could further streamline the process of preparing and delivering presentations.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities would not significantly impact the task of conducting presentations on research findings, as the primary focus is on verbal communication of research results rather than visual content. Therefore, this task does not align with the benefits of image capabilities provided by the LLM.
