1: In this task, the occupation involves drywall and ceiling tile installation, specifically trimming rough edges from wallboard to maintain even joints using knives. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality. 

Given the nature of the task, which involves physical work and manual labor using tools like knives, it is unlikely that the LLM can directly assist in completing the task. The task requires hands-on skills, precision, and physical manipulation of materials, which cannot be substituted by text-based instructions or information provided by the LLM. Therefore, the task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM or any tools built on top of it.
