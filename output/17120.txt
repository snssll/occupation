1: In this task, the Low Vision Therapists, Orientation and Mobility Specialists, and Vision Rehabilitation Therapists are required to train clients on how to use adaptive equipment. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if the task can be significantly expedited or improved by using the LLM. The LLM could potentially assist in providing detailed instructions on how to use specific adaptive equipment, generating training materials, or answering questions related to the equipment. However, since the task involves hands-on training and demonstration of equipment, which cannot be effectively replaced by text-based instructions alone, the LLM may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task.
