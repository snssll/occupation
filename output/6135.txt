1: In this task, a Library Assistant or Clerical Library Technician is required to enter and update patrons' records on computers. With the help of a large language model (LLM), the process of entering and updating patrons' records can be significantly expedited. The LLM can assist in generating standardized forms for data entry, automatically updating records based on provided information, and even cross-referencing data to ensure accuracy. The LLM can also help in identifying duplicate records, flagging inconsistencies, and suggesting corrections. Overall, the LLM can streamline the data entry and updating process, saving time and reducing the likelihood of errors.

Considering the capabilities of the LLM in transforming text and providing edits to existing text following specifications, it is evident that direct access to the LLM can reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality by at least half. Therefore, this task falls under label E1 - Direct exposure.
