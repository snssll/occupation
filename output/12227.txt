1: In this task, a Transportation Inspector is responsible for posting warning signs on vehicles containing hazardous materials. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it. 

- E0: This task involves physical interaction with vehicles and materials, which cannot be replaced by the LLM. Additionally, the task requires specific knowledge of transportation regulations and safety protocols, which may not be effectively addressed by the LLM alone. Therefore, this task is unlikely to benefit from LLM exposure.

- E1: While the LLM could potentially provide information on regulations and safety protocols related to hazardous materials, the task itself involves physical actions such as posting warning signs on vehicles. The LLM cannot perform physical tasks or interact with real-world objects, so its direct use in completing this task is limited.

- E2: It is conceivable that software could be developed on top of the LLM to assist Transportation Inspectors in quickly accessing relevant regulations, safety guidelines, or specific information about hazardous materials. This software could potentially streamline the process of identifying and posting warning signs on vehicles, but it would likely require integration with real-world systems to be fully effective.

- E3: The task does not involve image processing or detailed visual analysis that would benefit from additional image capabilities. Therefore, exposure to image capabilities would not significantly impact the completion of this task.
