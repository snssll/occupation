1: In this task, a cook in a restaurant is required to substitute for or assist other cooks during emergencies or rush periods. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider whether access to the LLM alone or with additional software could significantly reduce the time it takes for a cook to complete this task with high quality.

- E0: This task involves physical actions in a fast-paced environment, such as cooking in a restaurant kitchen during emergencies or rush periods. The task requires immediate responses and hands-on cooking skills, which cannot be effectively replaced by the LLM or any software tool.

- E1: The LLM could potentially provide some guidance on recipes or cooking techniques that could help a cook during emergencies. However, the real-time nature of the task and the need for hands-on cooking make it challenging for the LLM to directly assist in substituting or assisting other cooks during rush periods.

- E2: While the LLM could potentially be used to provide quick recipe lookups or cooking tips, the task of substituting for or assisting other cooks during emergencies or rush periods is highly dynamic and requires real-time decision-making and physical actions. Developing software on top of the LLM that could effectively assist in such scenarios would be complex and may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task.

- E3: The task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images, so the image capabilities of the LLM are not relevant in this context.

2: E0
