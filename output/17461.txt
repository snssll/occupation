1: In this task, the occupation involves helpers for extraction workers who are responsible for unloading materials, devices, and machine parts using hand tools. This task does not involve complex decision-making, specialized domain knowledge, or detailed documentation. It is a straightforward physical task that requires manual labor. Since the task does not involve any written or spoken communication, data analysis, or information retrieval beyond the physical act of unloading materials, it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM. The LLM cannot assist in physical tasks that require manual labor, and there are no additional software applications that could be developed on top of the LLM to automate this task.
