1: In this task, a Customs and Border Protection Officer is required to locate and seize contraband, undeclared merchandise, and vehicles, aircraft, or boats that contain such merchandise. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves physical inspection, identification, and seizure of illegal items. This task requires on-the-ground presence, physical interaction, and decision-making based on real-time observations. While an LLM could potentially assist in providing information on common smuggling techniques or legal guidelines, the core aspect of physically locating and seizing contraband cannot be effectively performed by the LLM alone. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not significantly benefit from LLM capabilities.
