1: In this task, a pharmacist is required to teach pharmacy students who are serving as interns in preparation for their graduation or licensure. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider whether access to the LLM alone or with additional software could significantly reduce the time it takes for a pharmacist to prepare and deliver teaching materials to pharmacy students. 

- E0: This task involves human interaction and requires the pharmacist to provide hands-on guidance, feedback, and mentorship to the students. The LLM cannot physically interact with the students or provide practical training, so it cannot significantly reduce the time spent on this task.
- E1: While the LLM could potentially assist in generating written educational materials, answering questions, or providing background information, the core aspect of teaching and mentoring pharmacy students involves practical demonstrations, discussions, and personalized guidance that cannot be effectively replaced by the LLM alone. Therefore, the time savings would not be significant enough to warrant an E1 label.
- E2: It is conceivable that additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to help pharmacists in preparing teaching materials, generating quizzes, or providing supplementary information. However, the core aspect of hands-on teaching and mentorship would still require human interaction and expertise that the LLM cannot replicate.
- E3: The task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images, so the image capabilities of the LLM are not relevant in this context.

2: E0
