1: In this task, the Automotive and Watercraft Service Attendants are required to provide customers with information about local roads or highways. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes for an average worker to complete this task with high quality. 

- E0: This task involves providing real-time, location-specific information about local roads or highways to customers. The task requires human interaction and real-time decision-making based on current conditions, which cannot be effectively replaced by the LLM alone.

- E1: The LLM could potentially assist in generating scripted responses or providing general information about local roads or highways. However, the real-time nature of the task and the need for accurate, up-to-date information may limit the LLM's effectiveness in significantly reducing the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality.

- E2: While the LLM could be used to generate general information about local roads or highways, additional software that integrates real-time traffic data and mapping services would be needed to provide accurate and up-to-date information to customers. This additional software could potentially reduce the time it takes to complete the task by half.

- E3: The task does not involve image capabilities, so exposure to LLM with image capabilities is not relevant in this context.

2: E0
