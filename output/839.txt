1: In this task, the Highway Maintenance Worker applies oil to road surfaces using sprayers. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM or LLM-powered tools can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality. 

- The task of applying oil to road surfaces using sprayers is a physical task that requires manual labor and specific skills related to handling equipment and working outdoors. The LLM cannot physically perform this task, as it involves interacting with the physical environment.
- While the LLM could potentially provide information on best practices for applying oil to road surfaces or safety guidelines, the task itself cannot be directly completed by the LLM.
- There are no text-based or image-based components to this task that would benefit from LLM capabilities, as it is a hands-on, physical task.

Based on these considerations, the task of applying oil to road surfaces using sprayers would be classified as E0 - No exposure to LLM.
