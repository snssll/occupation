1: In this task, a Counter and Rental Clerk is responsible for preparing merchandise for display or purchase/rental. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality. The task involves physical actions such as arranging merchandise, which cannot be directly performed by the LLM. While the LLM can provide information on how to display merchandise effectively or offer suggestions on organizing items, it cannot physically handle the merchandise. Therefore, the task does not fall under E1 as it cannot be entirely completed by the LLM. Additionally, developing software on top of the LLM to handle physical tasks like preparing merchandise is not feasible. The task does not involve complex data analysis, specialized domain knowledge, or image processing that would require E2 or E3 exposure. Hence, the task falls under E0 as it does not significantly benefit from LLM capabilities.

2: E0

3: Moderate
