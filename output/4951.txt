1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of developing methods to assess corporate performance in terms of ESG issues as a Financial Quantitative Analyst, we need to consider the nature of the task and the potential impact of using an LLM.

- Financial Quantitative Analysts typically require a deep understanding of financial data, statistical analysis, and modeling techniques to evaluate investment opportunities and risks.
- Developing methods to assess corporate performance in ESG issues involves analyzing a wide range of data related to environmental impact, social responsibility, and governance practices.
- An LLM could assist in generating insights from large volumes of text data related to ESG reports, regulations, and company disclosures.
- The LLM could help in summarizing and analyzing complex information to identify trends and patterns in ESG performance metrics.
- However, the task also requires domain-specific knowledge of financial analysis, quantitative methods, and ESG frameworks, which may not be fully covered by the LLM alone.

Considering these points, the task could benefit from the LLM's text analysis capabilities to process and extract insights from ESG-related documents. Still, the domain-specific expertise required for financial analysis and ESG evaluation may limit the extent to which the LLM can fully automate the task, placing it in the E2 category.
