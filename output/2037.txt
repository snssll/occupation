1: In this task, the main responsibility is to clean job sites, which involves removing debris, trash, and cleaning up the area after plastering or stucco work. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if the task can be significantly expedited or improved by using the LLM. Since cleaning job sites is a physical task that requires manual labor and does not involve complex decision-making or information processing that the LLM can assist with, it is unlikely that the LLM can reduce the time it takes to complete this task. The LLM does not have the capability to physically clean job sites or interact with the physical environment, so it cannot directly assist in this task.
