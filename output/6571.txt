1: In this task, a Laundry and Dry-Cleaning Worker is required to examine and sort articles to be cleaned based on various criteria such as color, fabric, dirt content, and cleaning technique required. To determine the appropriate exposure label for this task:

- E1: Direct access to the LLM could potentially reduce the time it takes to complete this task by providing guidance on the best cleaning techniques for different fabrics, colors, and dirt content. The LLM could assist in generating a detailed sorting plan based on the specific characteristics of the articles.
  
- E2: While an LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time to complete this task, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to create a system that can provide real-time recommendations on sorting articles based on color, fabric, dirt content, and cleaning techniques. This system could integrate up-to-date information on the best practices in laundry and dry-cleaning.

- E3: Image capabilities would not significantly impact this task as it primarily involves text-based instructions and sorting articles based on specific criteria. The task does not require detailed image analysis or editing.

Based on the above analysis, the most suitable exposure label for this task is E2.

2: E2

3: Moderate
