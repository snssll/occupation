1: In this task, a physical therapist is evaluating, fitting, or adjusting prosthetic or orthotic devices for patients. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be significantly aided by text-based input and output capabilities of the model. The task involves hands-on work with physical devices and direct interaction with patients, which cannot be replaced by text-based interactions alone. While the LLM could potentially provide information on the latest advancements in prosthetic or orthotic devices, it cannot physically evaluate, fit, or adjust these devices. Therefore, the task does not align with the capabilities of the LLM in a way that would significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task.
