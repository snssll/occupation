1: In this task, a Home Health Aide is required to provide emotional support and instruction to patients and families in various areas such as caring for infants, preparing healthy meals, living independently, or adapting to disability or illness. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be significantly aided by the use of the language model. The task involves a high level of human interaction, emotional intelligence, and practical caregiving skills, which are not directly related to text-based information processing. While the LLM could potentially provide general information on these topics, the core of the task involves hands-on care and emotional support that cannot be effectively replaced by text-based AI tools. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as the use of LLM would not significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete the task.
