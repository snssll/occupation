1: In this task, a Lighting Technician is responsible for patching or wiring lights to dimmers or other electronic consoles. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- Patching or wiring lights to dimmers involves technical knowledge and hands-on skills related to electrical systems and lighting equipment.
- While the task involves physical actions such as connecting wires, the core activity is technical in nature and does not require human interaction or precise measurements.
- The task does not involve detailed visuals or specialized domain knowledge beyond lighting and electrical systems.
- The task can be broken down into discrete steps that involve following specific instructions and understanding the technical requirements of connecting lights to dimmers.

Based on these considerations, the task of patching or wiring lights to dimmers falls under E2 exposure. While the task may not be directly reducible to text-based interactions with an LLM, it is conceivable that software could be developed to assist in providing guidance, troubleshooting tips, or step-by-step instructions for completing the wiring process more efficiently.
