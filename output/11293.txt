1: In this task, the farmworker is required to patrol grazing lands either on horseback or using all-terrain vehicles. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality. 

- The task involves physical activity such as riding on horseback or using vehicles, which cannot be directly assisted by the LLM.
- The task does not involve text input or output, and the context of the task is more related to physical monitoring and surveillance.
- The LLM does not have the capability to assist in physical tasks like patrolling grazing lands.

Based on these considerations, it is clear that the task of patrolling grazing lands on horseback or using all-terrain vehicles falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM.

2: E0

3: High
