1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of reviewing and critiquing proposals, plans, or designs related to water or wastewater treatment systems, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM could assist in providing information on best practices, regulations, or innovative technologies in water and wastewater treatment systems. It could help in summarizing complex technical documents, generating questions for further analysis, or even providing feedback on specific aspects of proposals or designs. The LLM could also assist in writing detailed critiques based on the input provided.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time it takes to review and critique proposals, plans, or designs, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to streamline the process. For example, an application could be created to automatically extract key information from proposals, compare designs against industry standards, or even generate alternative solutions based on the input data.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Since the task primarily involves reviewing text-based proposals, plans, or designs, and does not require detailed visual analysis or image editing, the image capabilities of the LLM would not significantly impact the completion of this task.

Based on the above analysis, the task of reviewing and critiquing proposals, plans, or designs related to water or wastewater treatment systems would likely fall under E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications.

2: E2

3: Moderate
