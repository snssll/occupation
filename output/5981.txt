1: In this task, the Hazardous Materials Removal Workers are required to drive trucks or heavy equipment to transport contaminated waste to specific locations. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality. 

- Hazardous Materials Removal Workers primarily involve physical tasks such as driving trucks and handling contaminated waste, which cannot be directly assisted by the LLM.
- The task does not involve writing, summarizing documents, providing feedback, or any other text-based activities that the LLM could directly assist with.
- While the LLM could potentially provide information on hazardous materials regulations or safety protocols, the core task of physically transporting waste cannot be significantly aided by the LLM alone.

Based on these considerations, the task falls under E0 as it does not meet the criteria for exposure to LLM assistance.
