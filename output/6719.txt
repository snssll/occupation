1: In this task, a carpenter is required to examine structural timbers and supports to detect decay and replace them as needed using hand tools, nuts, and bolts. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves physical inspection, detection of decay, and manual replacement of timbers, which are hands-on activities that cannot be directly performed by an LLM. The task does not involve text input or output, complex instructions, or data analysis that could be significantly aided by an LLM. Therefore, the task does not align with any of the exposure levels in the rubric.
