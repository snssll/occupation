1: In this task of marking tires of parked vehicles with chalk and recording the time of marking to monitor parking time limits, the exposure to LLM can be evaluated as follows:

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** The task involves a repetitive and straightforward process of marking tires and recording time intervals. The LLM can assist in generating a system for recording and tracking this information efficiently. It can potentially automate the process of time recording and provide reminders for when to return to check the parked vehicles. The LLM can also help in summarizing data or generating reports based on the recorded information.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the task itself may not require complex analysis or specialized knowledge beyond monitoring time limits, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to enhance efficiency. For example, an application could be created to automatically track and notify parking enforcement workers of vehicles exceeding time limits based on the recorded data. This could involve data analysis and decision-making capabilities beyond the basic task description.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Image capabilities would not significantly impact the completion of this task as it primarily involves recording time intervals and monitoring parked vehicles. There is no need for image processing or analysis in this context.
