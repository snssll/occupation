1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of arranging financing for productions under the occupation of Producers and Directors, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM in assisting with this task. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM can help in writing and transforming text, providing edits, summarizing documents, answering questions, and maintaining records. In this case, the LLM could assist in drafting funding proposals, summarizing financial information, or providing feedback on financing plans.
- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time to complete the task, additional software could be developed to analyze financial data, make recommendations on funding sources, or retrieve information on financing options.
- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not relevant for the task of arranging financing for productions.

Considering the task involves financial planning and decision-making, which may require specialized domain knowledge and analysis beyond what the LLM can provide, it is more likely to fall under E2 where additional software could be developed to enhance the LLM's capabilities in this area.
