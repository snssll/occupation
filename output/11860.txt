1: In this task, a biologist is required to plan and administer biological research programs for various sectors. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves strategic planning, program administration, and coordination of research activities. While an LLM could assist in providing general information about biological research programs, it may not significantly reduce the time it takes for a biologist to plan and administer these programs, especially considering the specialized domain knowledge and decision-making involved. The task also does not involve text generation, translation, summarization, or data analysis that could be directly facilitated by an LLM. Therefore, the task does not align with E1 exposure as the LLM alone is unlikely to reduce the time significantly. However, it is conceivable that specialized software could be developed on top of the LLM to assist biologists in organizing and managing research programs more efficiently, potentially falling under E2 exposure.
