1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of locating and recording data on sales of comparable property as an Appraiser of Personal and Business Property, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. In this task, the Appraiser needs to gather data on sales of comparable properties, which may involve searching for information online, using specialized software, or accessing personal records. The LLM can assist in conducting internet searches to find relevant data and information. It can also help in organizing and recording the gathered data. However, the task may require accessing specialized databases or detailed real estate information that the LLM may not have direct access to. While the LLM can aid in some aspects of the task, it may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task by half, as it may lack access to specific databases or up-to-date real estate information.
