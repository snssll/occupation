1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of preparing parts sketches and writing work orders and purchase requests as a Mechanical Engineering Technologist or Technician, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be impacted by the use of the LLM.

- Writing parts sketches involves technical knowledge and the ability to accurately represent mechanical components. The LLM can assist in generating text descriptions based on provided information, but it may not have the specialized knowledge required to create detailed technical sketches.
- Writing work orders and purchase requests involves clear communication of requirements and specifications. The LLM can help in drafting these documents based on input data, but it may not have the domain-specific knowledge to ensure all technical details are accurately included.

Considering these points, the task involves a combination of technical knowledge, communication skills, and domain-specific expertise that may not be fully covered by the LLM alone. While the LLM can assist in generating text content, the task also requires a deep understanding of mechanical engineering principles and industry-specific terminology.
