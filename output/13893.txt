1: In this task, an audiologist is required to recommend assistive devices based on patients' needs or nature of impairments. To complete this task, the audiologist needs to have a deep understanding of the patient's condition, their specific requirements, and the available assistive devices in the market. The task involves analyzing the patient's medical history, conducting assessments, and matching the right assistive device to improve the patient's quality of life.

When considering the exposure rubric, the task of recommending assistive devices to patients can benefit from the use of a powerful LLM. The LLM can assist in providing up-to-date information on the latest assistive devices available, their features, benefits, and reviews. It can also help in generating personalized recommendations based on the patient's specific needs and impairments. The LLM can analyze vast amounts of data and research to suggest the most suitable assistive devices for different types of impairments.
