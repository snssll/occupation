1: In this task, a Parking Enforcement Worker is required to maintain close communications with dispatching personnel using two-way radios or cell phones. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it. 

- E0: This task involves direct human-to-human communication and real-time coordination, which may not be easily replaced by LLM technology. The task does not involve complex data analysis or specialized knowledge that the LLM could significantly enhance.

- E1: While the LLM could potentially assist in drafting communication messages or providing information related to dispatching procedures, the core aspect of real-time communication using radios or cell phones is not a task that can be significantly expedited or improved by the LLM.

- E2: It is conceivable that additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to streamline communication processes, such as automatically transcribing messages or providing real-time language translation. However, the fundamental aspect of direct communication with dispatching personnel remains a human-centric task.

- E3: The task does not involve image processing or analysis, so the image capabilities of the LLM are not relevant in this context.

2: E0

3: Moderate
