1: In this task, a glazier is responsible for setting glass doors into frames and attaching hardware such as metal hinges, handles, locks, etc. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider whether the task can be significantly expedited or improved by using the LLM. 

- The task of setting glass doors into frames and attaching hardware is a hands-on, physical task that requires manual dexterity and knowledge of construction techniques. The LLM, even with its text-based capabilities, cannot directly assist in physically handling glass doors or hardware.
- While the LLM could potentially provide written instructions or guidance on the process, the nature of the task is such that it primarily involves practical skills and physical labor.
- The task does not involve complex data analysis, writing, summarization, or other text-based activities that the LLM excels at. It is a task that is best suited for individuals with hands-on experience in the field of glazing.

Based on these considerations, the task of setting glass doors into frames and attaching hardware is best classified as E0 - No exposure.
