1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of suggesting specific product purchases to meet customers' needs as a Demonstrator or Product Promoter, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. In this task, the LLM can assist by generating suggestions based on customer needs and product features. The model can analyze the input regarding customer requirements and product details to provide tailored recommendations. This task involves text input (customer needs) and text output (product suggestions), which falls within the capabilities of the LLM. The model can process the information provided and generate relevant responses, making it suitable for tasks that involve providing recommendations based on specific criteria.

Considering the nature of the task and the LLM's ability to process text input and generate text output, this task aligns with E1 - Direct exposure. The LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task by providing tailored product suggestions based on customer needs.
