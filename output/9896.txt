1: Geothermal Technicians are responsible for monitoring and adjusting the operations of geothermal power plant equipment or systems. To determine the appropriate exposure label for this task in relation to the LLM, we need to consider the nature of the task. Monitoring and adjusting operations of geothermal power plant equipment may involve understanding technical specifications, analyzing data, and making real-time decisions based on the performance of the systems. While the LLM can provide information on geothermal energy and power plant operations, it may not directly interface with the equipment or systems in a physical sense. Therefore, the task does not involve writing, transforming text, or generating content that the LLM can significantly expedite. Additionally, the task requires hands-on monitoring and adjustment of equipment, which cannot be performed by the LLM. As a result, the task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM or systems built on top of it.
