1: In this task, a Cost Estimator is required to prepare cost and expenditure statements regularly throughout a project. This task involves analyzing project costs, tracking expenses, and documenting financial information. With the help of a large language model (LLM), the estimator could potentially automate the process of generating these statements by inputting project data and having the LLM assist in organizing and formatting the information into the required documentation. The LLM could also help in calculating estimates based on historical data or industry standards. Overall, the LLM could significantly reduce the time and effort required to prepare these statements, making the task more efficient.

Considering the nature of the task and the potential for the LLM to streamline the process of cost estimation and documentation, this task falls under E1 - Direct exposure. The LLM can assist in writing and transforming text (cost statements), providing edits to existing text (documentation), and summarizing financial data to generate the necessary documentation efficiently.
