1: In this task, the allergist or immunologist is required to prescribe medication such as antihistamines, antibiotics, and glucocorticosteroids. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves medical knowledge and expertise in prescribing medications based on a patient's condition and needs.
- The task does not involve writing or transforming text/code, summarizing documents, providing feedback on documents, or any other text-based activities that could be directly assisted by an LLM.
- While an LLM could potentially provide general information about these medications, it cannot replace the specialized medical knowledge required to prescribe them accurately.
- The task does not involve image capabilities, as it is solely focused on prescribing medications.

Based on these considerations, the task falls under E0 as it requires specialized medical expertise and decision-making that cannot be significantly assisted by an LLM.
