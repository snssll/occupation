1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of sight-reading musical parts during rehearsals for Musicians and Singers, we need to consider how the LLM could assist in completing this task.

The LLM does not have the ability to physically read and interpret musical notes in real-time as a musician would during rehearsals. Therefore, the task falls under E0 as it cannot be significantly expedited or improved by the LLM.

2: E0

3: High certainty
