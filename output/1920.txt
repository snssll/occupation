1: In this task, an embalmer is required to clean and disinfect areas where bodies are prepared and embalmed. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality.

- The task involves physical cleaning and disinfection, which cannot be directly assisted by the LLM.
- The task does not involve complex text input or output that the LLM can assist with.
- There are no documents to summarize, questions to answer, or emails to write that would benefit from LLM assistance.
- The task does not involve image capabilities that the LLM could assist with.

Based on these considerations, it is clear that the task of cleaning and disinfecting areas for embalming does not align with any of the exposure levels in the rubric. The LLM cannot assist in physical tasks or tasks that do not involve text input or output.
