1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of building, testing, and modifying product prototypes as a Computer Hardware Engineer, we need to consider the level of exposure to LLM.

- This task involves a significant amount of technical knowledge and expertise in computer hardware engineering.
- The task requires hands-on work with physical prototypes and computer simulations.
- While the LLM can provide information and guidance on theoretical models and simulations, it cannot physically build or test prototypes.
- The task does not involve writing or transforming text, providing edits to existing text, or generating questions, which are typical tasks where LLM exposure would be more direct.
- The task does not involve highly specialized domain knowledge retrieval or complex database maintenance, which could benefit from additional software built on top of the LLM.

Based on these considerations, the task of building, testing, and modifying product prototypes as a Computer Hardware Engineer would fall under label E0 as it does not clearly benefit from LLM exposure in terms of reducing the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete the task.
