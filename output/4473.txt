1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of designing spaces to display pottery for sale for Potters, Manufacturing, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be aided by the use of the OpenAI large language model (LLM).

- E0: This task involves a high degree of creativity and spatial design, which may not be easily automated or assisted by the LLM. The task requires a human touch and understanding of aesthetics, which the LLM may not be able to provide.

- E1: While the LLM can assist in generating ideas or providing suggestions for the design of spaces, the final decision-making and implementation of the design would likely still require human input. The LLM can help with brainstorming and providing inspiration, but the actual design process may not be significantly expedited by the LLM.

- E2: It is conceivable that additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to assist in designing spaces for displaying pottery. This software could potentially analyze trends in design, provide recommendations based on customer preferences, or even generate 3D visualizations of the display spaces. However, this would require a more specialized application beyond the capabilities of the LLM alone.

- E3: The task of designing spaces to display pottery for sale may benefit from image capabilities in conjunction with the LLM. With the ability to view and create images, the system could potentially assist in visualizing different display layouts or configurations. However, the LLM's text-based capabilities may not be the primary driver in this scenario.
