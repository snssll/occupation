1: In this task, the Urban and Regional Planner is responsible for designing, promoting, or administering government plans or policies related to various aspects of urban development. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be significantly aided by the use of the language model. The LLM can assist in providing information on best practices, case studies, regulations, and policies related to urban planning. It can also help in drafting reports, analyzing data, and generating recommendations based on input data. However, the task involves a high level of human judgment, understanding of local contexts, and collaboration with stakeholders, which may not be fully replaceable by the LLM. While the LLM can provide valuable insights and support in research and data analysis, the final decisions and implementations would likely require human expertise.
