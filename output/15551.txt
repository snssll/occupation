1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of selecting qualified job applicants or referring them to managers as a Human Resources Specialist, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be aided by the use of a large language model (LLM).

- E1: Direct exposure - The task involves reviewing job applications, assessing qualifications, and making hiring recommendations. An LLM can assist in this process by providing templates for job descriptions, analyzing candidate resumes, and even generating tailored questions for interviews based on the job requirements. The LLM can also help in drafting emails to communicate with applicants or managers.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM can streamline parts of the task, such as generating interview questions or drafting communication, additional software could be developed to integrate with the LLM for more advanced functions. This software could potentially automate the initial screening process by analyzing resumes and matching them with job requirements, thus reducing the time taken to select qualified applicants.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not relevant to the task of selecting job applicants, so this label does not apply.

Based on the above analysis, the task of selecting qualified job applicants or referring them to managers as a Human Resources Specialist is best classified as E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications.
