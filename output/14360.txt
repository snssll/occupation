1: In this task, a Maid or Housekeeping Cleaner is required to remove debris from driveways, garages, and swimming pool areas. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. Since the task involves physical labor and manual work, it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM or any tools built on top of it. The task cannot be completed through text input and output alone, as it requires physical presence and action. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not benefit from the use of the LLM or any LLM-powered tools.

2: E0

3: High
