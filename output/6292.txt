1: In this task, a retail salesperson is required to estimate the cost of repair or alteration of merchandise. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be facilitated by the LLM. 

- The task involves analyzing and estimating costs, which may require knowledge of pricing, materials, and labor. The LLM can provide general information on these aspects but may not have access to specific pricing data or current market rates without up-to-date facts.
- The task does not involve complex data analysis or specialized domain knowledge that would significantly benefit from additional software beyond the LLM.
- While the LLM can assist in generating text or providing general information, it may not have the capability to accurately estimate repair costs without specific details or real-time data.

Based on these considerations, the task of estimating the cost of repair or alteration of merchandise falls under E0 as it does not clearly benefit from the capabilities of the LLM to reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete the task significantly.
