1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of reviewing project requests describing database user needs to estimate time and cost required to accomplish the project for Database Architects, we can consider the following:

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** The task involves analyzing text input (project requests) and providing estimates based on that information. An LLM could assist in understanding the project requirements, estimating time and cost, and generating a response based on the input. The LLM can help in transforming text input into estimated time and cost, which aligns with the capabilities of the model. Therefore, this task could benefit significantly from direct access to the LLM, reducing the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality by at least half.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the task could potentially be streamlined further with additional software that could be developed on top of the LLM, such as tools for analyzing project requests, retrieving relevant data, and providing more detailed estimates, the core task of reviewing project requests and estimating time and cost aligns well with the capabilities of the LLM itself. Therefore, the task may not require additional software beyond the LLM to achieve significant time savings.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Image capabilities are not directly relevant to the task of reviewing project requests and estimating time and cost for database projects. Therefore, this task does not fall under E3.
