1: In this task, a Funeral Home Manager is required to plan and implement sales promotions or marketing strategies for funeral home operations. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves creating marketing strategies, which can benefit from the capabilities of the LLM in generating ideas, drafting promotional materials, and providing insights into effective marketing techniques. The LLM can assist in brainstorming, drafting promotional content, analyzing market trends, and suggesting innovative strategies based on existing data. While the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time to complete the task, additional software built on top of the LLM could potentially streamline the process by providing tailored marketing recommendations, analyzing market data, and generating detailed marketing plans. Therefore, this task falls under E2 as having access to the LLM alone may not halve the time to complete the task, but additional software leveraging the LLM's capabilities could enhance efficiency.
