1: In this task of designing or engineering filtration systems to reduce harmful emissions, an aerospace engineer would typically need to have a strong understanding of aerodynamics, fluid dynamics, materials science, and environmental regulations. They would need to analyze the emissions produced by aircraft engines, understand the properties of different filtration materials, and design systems that effectively capture and neutralize harmful pollutants. 

For this task, the exposure to LLM would fall under E0. The task involves highly specialized knowledge in aerospace engineering, particularly in the area of emissions reduction, which goes beyond the capabilities of the LLM. While the LLM could potentially provide general information on filtration systems or environmental regulations, it lacks the domain-specific expertise required for designing aerospace filtration systems for emissions reduction.
