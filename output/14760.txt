1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of researching current trends and new technology as an Art Director, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves gathering information on printing production techniques, computer software, and design trends, which can be done through text-based research. The LLM can assist in this task by providing up-to-date information on these topics within the context of 2000 words. The model can generate summaries, answer questions, and provide insights based on the input provided. However, the task does not involve complex data analysis, specialized domain knowledge, or image processing, which would require additional capabilities beyond text-based information retrieval. Therefore, the task falls under E1 as the LLM can significantly reduce the time needed to gather relevant information and insights for an Art Director.
