- This task involves communication and collaboration with management to align on system principles, which requires a deep understanding of both technical systems and business needs.
- The LLM can assist in providing information, generating potential system principles, and offering insights based on existing data and knowledge.
- The LLM can help in drafting communication materials, summarizing key points, and generating questions or responses related to system principles.
- While the LLM can aid in written communication aspects of the task, the core of the task involves human interaction, negotiation, and ensuring mutual understanding, which are not easily replaceable by the LLM alone.
