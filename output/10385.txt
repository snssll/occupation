1: In this task, the Gambling Manager needs to notify board attendants of table vacancies to ensure waiting patrons can play. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we can break down the task:
- The task involves communicating information (table vacancies) to specific individuals (board attendants) to facilitate a process (allowing waiting patrons to play).
- The task does not require complex decision-making, specialized domain knowledge, or detailed data analysis.
- The task primarily involves written communication and coordination.

Based on these considerations, the task falls under E1 exposure. The LLM can assist in generating the communication message to notify board attendants efficiently, saving time and ensuring clear instructions are provided.
