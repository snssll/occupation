1: In this task, a fashion designer is required to purchase new or used clothing and accessory items to complete their designs. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone or with additional software could significantly reduce the time it takes for a fashion designer to complete this task.

- E0: This task involves physical actions such as selecting and purchasing items, which cannot be directly performed by the LLM or any software tool. The decision-making process involved in selecting items also requires human judgment and cannot be entirely automated.
- E1: While the LLM could potentially assist in researching fashion trends, providing information on specific items, or generating ideas for designs, it cannot physically purchase items. The task of selecting and purchasing clothing and accessories still heavily relies on human decision-making and interaction.
- E2: It is conceivable that a specialized software tool could be developed on top of the LLM to streamline the research process for fashion designers, suggest specific items based on trends or design requirements, or even connect designers with suppliers. However, the actual act of physically purchasing items would still require human intervention.
- E3: The task does not involve image processing or detailed visual instructions that would benefit from image capabilities in conjunction with the LLM.

Based on the above analysis, the most appropriate exposure label for this task is E2.

2: E2

3: Moderate
