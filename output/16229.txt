1: In this task, a Tire Builder is responsible for starting rollers that bond tread and plies as drums revolve. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone or with additional software could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality. 

Given that this task involves physical actions such as starting rollers and bonding materials as drums revolve, it falls under the category of manual labor that cannot be directly replaced by text-based AI models like the LLM. The task requires hands-on work and precise physical coordination, which cannot be replicated by the LLM or any software built on top of it. Therefore, this task would not benefit from exposure to the LLM or LLM-powered applications.
