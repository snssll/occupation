1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of developing computer programs to collect meteorological data or present meteorological information as an Atmospheric and Space Scientist, we need to consider the nature of the task and the capabilities of the LLM.

- Developing computer programs involves writing and transforming code according to complex instructions, which is a task that the LLM can assist with by providing code snippets, suggestions, or explanations.
- The task requires expertise in meteorology and data presentation, which the LLM may not have on its own. However, it can provide general programming guidance and potentially assist in specific coding tasks related to data collection and presentation.
- While the LLM may not have specialized domain knowledge in meteorology, it can still be a valuable tool in the development process by generating ideas, providing examples, or assisting with coding challenges.

Based on these considerations, the task of developing computer programs for meteorological purposes could be classified as E2 - Exposure by LLM-powered applications. While the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task, additional software built on top of the LLM could enhance the development process by providing relevant examples, code snippets, or programming guidance.
