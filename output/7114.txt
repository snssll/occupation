1: In this task, an Advertising Sales Agent is required to gather all relevant material for bid processes and coordinate bidding and contract approval. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves gathering relevant material, which may require searching and synthesizing information from various sources. An LLM could assist in summarizing documents, providing insights, and generating relevant questions based on the gathered material.
- Coordinating bidding and contract approval involves communication and potentially negotiation. An LLM could help in drafting emails, providing feedback on documents, and even suggesting negotiation strategies based on the information provided.

Considering the capabilities of the LLM to assist in tasks related to writing, summarizing, providing feedback, and generating questions, this task could benefit significantly from direct access to the LLM. The LLM could streamline the process of gathering information, drafting communications, and coordinating the bidding process.
