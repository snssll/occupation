1: In this task, a Chemical Equipment Operator and Tender is required to dump or scoop specific materials into equipment. This task involves physical actions such as handling materials and operating equipment. The task does not involve complex decision-making, analysis, or communication that could be significantly enhanced by the use of an LLM. The LLM cannot physically handle materials or operate equipment, so it cannot directly assist in completing this task. Therefore, the task does not fall under E1, E2, or E3 exposure categories as the LLM does not provide a substantial advantage in completing the task.
