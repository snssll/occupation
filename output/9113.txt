1: In this task, a dental hygienist is responsible for maintaining dental equipment and ensuring that dental instruments are sharp and sterilized. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes for a dental hygienist to complete this task with high quality.

- Direct exposure (E1): The LLM could potentially assist by providing detailed instructions on how to properly maintain and sterilize dental equipment. It could offer step-by-step guides, safety protocols, and best practices for instrument sharpening and sterilization. The LLM could also generate documentation on equipment maintenance schedules and guidelines for instrument care. Overall, the LLM could streamline the process by providing accurate and up-to-date information, potentially reducing the time needed for a dental hygienist to perform these tasks.
