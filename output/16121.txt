1: In this task, a Forest and Conservation Worker is required to spray or inject vegetation with insecticides or herbicides. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves physical work in the field, such as spraying or injecting chemicals into vegetation. This task requires hands-on application of chemicals and direct interaction with the environment. Since the task involves physical actions and does not primarily rely on text-based information processing, it is unlikely that access to an LLM would significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of an LLM.
