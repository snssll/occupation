1: In this task, a glazier installs pre-assembled metal or wood frameworks for windows or doors to be fitted with glass panels using hand tools. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves physical work that requires manual dexterity and the use of hand tools. It does not involve complex written or spoken communication, data analysis, or decision-making based on information processing. The task is primarily focused on manual labor and does not directly involve text input or output that could be significantly enhanced by an LLM. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM or any tools built on top of it.
