1: In this task, a Park Naturalist is required to perform emergency duties to protect human life, government property, and natural features of the park. To determine the appropriate exposure label for this task in relation to the LLM, we can break it down as follows:

- The task involves responding to emergencies in a park setting, which may require quick decision-making and communication skills.
- While the LLM can provide information and guidance on emergency procedures, it may not have real-time data on the specific emergency situations in a park.
- The task does not involve complex data analysis or specialized domain knowledge that the LLM may need to retrieve.
- The LLM may not significantly reduce the time it takes for a Park Naturalist to perform emergency duties, as real-time decision-making and physical actions are likely required.

Based on these considerations, the task of performing emergency duties as a Park Naturalist is best classified as E0, as the LLM is not likely to significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task.
