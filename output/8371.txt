1: Avionics Technicians interpret flight test data to diagnose malfunctions and systemic performance problems. To determine the exposure label for this task, we need to consider the nature of the task and how an LLM could assist in completing it. 

- Avionics Technicians require specialized knowledge and expertise in aviation systems and electronics to interpret flight test data accurately.
- The task involves analyzing complex data sets and identifying issues with aircraft systems based on the data.
- An LLM could potentially assist by providing information on common malfunctions, suggesting troubleshooting steps, or explaining technical concepts related to avionics systems.
- However, the task also requires practical experience, hands-on skills, and real-time decision-making based on the data analysis, which may not be fully replicable by an LLM.

Considering these points, the task of interpreting flight test data to diagnose malfunctions and systemic performance problems falls under E2 - Exposure by LLM-powered applications. While an LLM could provide some assistance in terms of information and explanations, the specialized nature of the task and the need for practical application limit the extent to which the LLM can significantly reduce the time to complete the task.
