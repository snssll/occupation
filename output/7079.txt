1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of formulating and implementing training programs for Industrial-Organizational Psychologists, we need to consider how the task can benefit from the use of a large language model (LLM) like GPT-3.

- E1: Direct exposure - If the task involves writing and transforming text to develop training programs, providing edits to existing training materials, summarizing relevant documents, or generating questions for assessments, the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete these subtasks with equivalent quality. The LLM can assist in creating tailored training programs based on principles of learning and individual differences.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not reduce the time to complete the task by half, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to summarize longer documents, retrieve up-to-date information on learning principles, or provide recommendations based on data analysis. This additional software could enhance the efficiency of formulating and implementing training programs.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not directly relevant to the task of formulating and implementing training programs for Industrial-Organizational Psychologists. Therefore, this label is not applicable to this task.

2: E2

3: Moderate
