1: In this task, a Woodworking Machine Setter, Operator, or Tender would be responsible for examining raw woodstock for defects and ensuring it meets size and specification standards. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if the task can be significantly expedited or improved by using the LLM. The task involves visual inspection and manual assessment of the woodstock, which does not directly involve text input or output that the LLM could assist with. The LLM does not have the capability to physically examine the woodstock or provide real-time feedback on its quality. Therefore, the task does not align with any of the exposure levels in the rubric.

2: E0

3: High
