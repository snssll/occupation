1: In this task, a Self-Enrichment Teacher is required to participate in publicity planning and student recruitment. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves activities such as planning publicity campaigns, strategizing recruitment efforts, and possibly creating promotional materials. These activities heavily rely on human judgment, creativity, and interpersonal skills. While an LLM could potentially assist in generating written content for promotional materials or providing insights on effective recruitment strategies, the core aspects of this task, such as building relationships with potential students and making strategic decisions, are not easily automated by an LLM. Therefore, the task falls under E0 as it does not significantly benefit from LLM capabilities in reducing the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete the task.
