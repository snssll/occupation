1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of collecting and analyzing relevant data to identify real estate market trends for Appraisers and Assessors of Real Estate, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves data collection, analysis, and trend identification, which are activities that can benefit from the LLM's ability to process and analyze text data. The LLM can assist in summarizing reports, providing insights based on the data, and even generating reports based on the trends identified. While the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task by half, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to create tools that streamline data analysis and trend identification processes, potentially leading to a significant time-saving.
