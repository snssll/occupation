1: In this task, a photographer is required to determine desired images and picture composition, select and adjust subjects, equipment, and lighting to achieve desired effects. The task involves a high level of creativity, visual judgment, and technical skill. While an LLM could potentially assist with providing general information on photography techniques, equipment, and lighting, it cannot replace the hands-on work and artistic decision-making involved in capturing images. The task also requires physical interaction with subjects, equipment, and the environment, which is beyond the capabilities of an LLM. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it cannot be significantly expedited or completed with equivalent quality solely by using an LLM.

2: E0
