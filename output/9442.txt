1: In this task, the General Internal Medicine Physicians are required to manage and treat a wide range of health problems in patients of different age groups. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves diagnosing and treating various health conditions, which requires medical expertise, knowledge of current medical practices, and patient-specific information. While the LLM can provide general information on common health problems, it lacks the ability to access up-to-date medical knowledge or patient-specific data without being provided in the input. The task also involves making critical decisions based on individual patient assessments, which goes beyond the capabilities of the LLM. Therefore, the task does not significantly benefit from the use of the LLM in reducing the time it takes to complete the task with high quality.
