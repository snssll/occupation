1: In this task, a Sound Engineering Technician is responsible for preparing for recording sessions by selecting and setting up microphones. To determine the exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM could potentially provide guidance on microphone selection and setup techniques based on general knowledge and best practices in sound engineering. It could offer step-by-step instructions or tips on microphone types, placement, and settings. This could streamline the technician's decision-making process and improve the efficiency of microphone setup.
- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not drastically reduce the time for this task, additional software could be developed to provide specific recommendations for microphone selection and setup based on the latest industry standards, equipment compatibility, and room acoustics. This software could integrate with the LLM to offer tailored suggestions for each recording session.
- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities would not significantly impact this task as it primarily involves selecting and setting up microphones, which are audio equipment. There is no need for image analysis or visual input in this specific task.
