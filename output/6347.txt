1: In this task, a Fundraising Manager is required to evaluate advertising and promotion programs to ensure they align with fundraising efforts. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we can break down the task:
- The task involves analyzing and assessing the compatibility of advertising and promotion programs with fundraising goals, which requires critical thinking and decision-making based on knowledge of fundraising strategies.
- The task does not involve complex data analysis, specialized domain knowledge, or detailed image processing.
- While the LLM could potentially provide information on fundraising strategies and best practices, it may not significantly reduce the time it takes to evaluate specific advertising and promotion programs in the context of fundraising efforts.

Based on these considerations, the task of evaluating advertising and promotion programs for compatibility with fundraising efforts falls under E0 as it does not clearly decrease the time it takes for an experienced Fundraising Manager to complete the task with high quality by at least half.

2: E0

3: Moderate
