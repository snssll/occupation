1: Non-Destructive Testing Specialists are professionals who use various methods, including radiographic testing, to inspect materials and components for defects without causing damage to the objects being tested. The task provided involves making radiographic images to detect flaws in objects while keeping the objects intact. This task primarily involves capturing and interpreting radiographic images to identify any defects or anomalies in the objects being tested.

In this case, the task does not involve any direct interaction with the LLM or require the use of text input or output. The task is more focused on practical skills related to radiographic testing rather than text-based activities. While the LLM could potentially assist in providing information on radiographic testing techniques or interpreting radiographic images, its direct impact on completing the task of making radiographic images for flaw detection is limited.

Considering the nature of the task and the limited applicability of the LLM in directly assisting with the practical aspects of radiographic testing, I would classify this task as E0 - No exposure to the LLM.
