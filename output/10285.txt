1: In this task, an Insulation Worker is required to move controls, buttons, or levers to start blowers and regulate the flow of materials through nozzles. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. This task involves physical manipulation of controls and machinery, which cannot be directly assisted by an LLM. The task does not involve complex text-based instructions, writing, summarizing, analyzing data, or any other activity that an LLM could significantly assist with. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM.
