1: In this task, a Solar Sales Representative and Assessor assesses sites to determine their suitability for solar equipment. This involves using equipment such as tape measures, compasses, and computer software. The task does not involve precise measurements that require detailed dimensions, but rather a general assessment of the site's suitability. The computer software mentioned could potentially be used for data analysis, calculations, and generating reports based on the site assessments. While the task involves some physical aspects like using tape measures and compasses, the core of the task revolves around assessing sites and generating reports, which could be facilitated by an LLM in terms of data analysis, report generation, and potentially providing insights based on the assessment data.
