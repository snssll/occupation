1: In this task, a Sales Manager is required to visit franchised dealers to stimulate interest in the establishment or expansion of leasing programs. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves interacting with individuals, understanding their needs, and persuading them to consider leasing programs. This task requires human interaction, persuasion skills, and the ability to adapt to different situations. While an LLM could potentially assist in drafting communication materials or providing background information on leasing programs, the core of the task involves personal interaction and negotiation, which cannot be effectively replaced by an LLM. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not significantly benefit from LLM capabilities.
