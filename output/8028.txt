1: In this task, an air traffic controller is required to inspect, adjust, or control radio equipment or airport lights. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. Inspecting, adjusting, or controlling radio equipment or airport lights involves physical actions and interactions that cannot be directly performed by an LLM. These tasks require hands-on work and real-time decision-making based on visual and auditory cues, which are beyond the capabilities of a language model. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it involves physical actions and interactions that cannot be replaced by an LLM.
