1: In this task, the Parking Attendant's responsibility is to escort customers to their vehicles to ensure their safety. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if access to the LLM or LLM-powered tools can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality by at least half.

- The task of escorting customers to their vehicles involves physical interaction and ensuring the safety of individuals, which cannot be replaced by text-based tools like the LLM.
- The task does not involve complex data analysis, writing, summarizing documents, or any other text-based activities that the LLM could assist with.
- The nature of the task requires human presence, physical movement, and real-time decision-making based on the situation, which are not within the capabilities of the LLM.

Based on these considerations, the task of escorting customers to their vehicles as a Parking Attendant falls under label E0 - No exposure.
