1: In this task, an Adhesive Bonding Machine Operator and Tender is required to monitor machine operations to detect malfunctions and report or resolve problems. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality.

- E0: This task involves hands-on monitoring of machine operations, which cannot be directly assisted by the LLM. The LLM does not have the capability to physically monitor machines or resolve mechanical issues.

- E1: The task does not involve writing, transforming text, or providing feedback that can be directly assisted by the LLM. It requires practical machine operation monitoring skills that the LLM cannot provide.

- E2: While it is conceivable that software could be developed to assist in troubleshooting machine malfunctions by integrating the LLM's capabilities with real-time sensor data or maintenance logs, such a system is not currently available. The LLM alone cannot reduce the time significantly for this task.

- E3: The task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images, so the image capabilities of the LLM are not relevant here.

2: E0

3: High
