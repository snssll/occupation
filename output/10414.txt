1: In this task, a Transportation Inspector is responsible for notifying workers of any special treatment required for shipments. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves communicating specific instructions or information to workers regarding the handling of shipments. This task primarily involves written communication and does not require specialized domain knowledge beyond transportation regulations and procedures. The task can be completed effectively by providing clear and concise instructions to workers.

Given that the task involves writing and communicating instructions, the most suitable exposure label would be E1. The task can be completed more efficiently with the assistance of the LLM in drafting clear and detailed notifications for workers regarding special treatment required for shipments.
