1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of preparing obituaries for newspapers as a Funeral Attendant, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves writing text based on specific information about the deceased individual. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM can assist in writing and transforming text according to complex instructions, which aligns with the task of preparing obituaries. The model can generate text based on input data and specific guidelines, potentially reducing the time needed to craft obituaries with equivalent quality.
- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not reduce the time significantly for this task, additional software could be developed to streamline the process further. For example, an application that retrieves relevant information about the deceased individual from various sources and assists in crafting the obituary could enhance efficiency.
