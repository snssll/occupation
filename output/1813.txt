1: In this task, a Tax Preparer is required to check data input or verify totals on forms prepared by others to detect errors. With the help of a large language model (LLM), the Tax Preparer could potentially automate the process of error detection by inputting the forms and having the LLM analyze the data for errors in arithmetic, data entry, or procedures. The LLM could assist in identifying discrepancies and highlighting potential mistakes, thus streamlining the verification process.

Considering the nature of the task and the capabilities of the LLM, this task falls under E1 exposure. The LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task by automating the error detection process, providing accurate results in a shorter timeframe compared to manual verification.
