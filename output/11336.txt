1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of performing administrative duties for Zoologists and Wildlife Biologists, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. The task involves activities such as fundraising, public relations, budgeting, and staff supervision, which are primarily non-textual and require human interaction and decision-making. The LLM is not equipped to handle tasks that involve high degrees of human interaction, decision-making, or precise measurements. While the LLM can provide information or generate text-based content related to administrative tasks, it cannot directly perform the core functions of fundraising, public relations, budgeting, or staff supervision. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not significantly benefit from the capabilities of the LLM.
