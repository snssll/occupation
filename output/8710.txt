1: In this task, a First-Line Supervisor of Non-Retail Sales Workers is responsible for keeping records related to purchases, sales, and requisitions. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we can break down the task:
- The task involves primarily writing and maintaining records, which can be easily done by an LLM through text input and output.
- The information required for record-keeping is typically within the context of the sales operations of the organization, which can be captured within 2000 words.
- The task does not involve complex decision-making, precise measurements, or detailed visuals that would require human interaction or specialized tools beyond text input and output.

Based on these considerations, the task can be significantly expedited and completed with equivalent quality using an LLM, as it involves writing and maintaining records based on provided information.
