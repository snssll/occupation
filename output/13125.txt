1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of proposing resolutions for collective bargaining or other labor or contract negotiations as a Labor Relations Specialist, we need to consider the nature of the task and how the LLM could potentially assist in completing it.

- E1: Direct exposure - The task involves proposing resolutions for negotiations, which requires a deep understanding of labor laws, contracts, and negotiation strategies. The LLM could assist in providing relevant information, drafting proposals, or suggesting negotiation tactics based on the input provided. The LLM's ability to generate text and provide insights could significantly reduce the time it takes to prepare for negotiations.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not reduce the time to complete the task by half, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to analyze past negotiation data, provide real-time updates on labor laws, or offer personalized negotiation strategies based on historical data. These applications could enhance the efficiency of proposing resolutions for negotiations.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not relevant for the task of proposing resolutions for negotiations, as it primarily involves text-based information and negotiation strategies rather than visual content.

Based on the above analysis, the task of proposing resolutions for collective bargaining or other labor or contract negotiations is best classified as **E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications**.
