1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of cleaning, maintaining, and preparing supplies and work areas as a Biological Technician, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be impacted by the use of the LLM.

- The task of cleaning, maintaining, and preparing supplies and work areas is a physical task that involves manual labor and does not inherently involve complex decision-making or information processing that would benefit significantly from the use of an LLM.
- While the LLM could potentially provide written instructions or guidelines on how to clean or maintain specific equipment or areas, the actual execution of the task still requires physical effort and cannot be directly automated by the LLM.
- The task does not involve text input or output, complex data analysis, decision-making based on information processing, or any other activity where the LLM's capabilities would significantly reduce the time or effort required to complete the task.

Based on these considerations, the task of cleaning, maintaining, and preparing supplies and work areas as a Biological Technician would be classified as E0 - No exposure to LLM.
