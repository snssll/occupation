1: In this task, a Geothermal Technician is required to operate various types of equipment related to geothermal energy systems. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes for a Geothermal Technician to complete the task of operating equipment. Since this task involves physical operation of machinery and equipment, it does not directly involve text-based tasks that the LLM can assist with. The LLM cannot physically operate machinery or equipment, and the task does not involve text-based instructions or information retrieval that the LLM could assist with. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not align with the capabilities of the LLM.

2: E0

3: High
