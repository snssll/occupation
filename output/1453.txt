1: In this task, an Advertising Sales Agent is required to attend sales meetings, trade shows, and training seminars to gather information, promote products, expand their network of contacts, and increase their knowledge. To determine the appropriate exposure label for this task in relation to the LLM, we can break it down as follows:

- **E0**: This task involves physical presence and interaction at sales meetings, trade shows, and training seminars. It requires the agent to engage in face-to-face interactions, networking, and gathering information through personal attendance. The LLM or any tools built on top of it cannot replace the need for physical presence and human interaction in this context.

- **E1**: The LLM could potentially assist in preparing for these events by providing information on industry trends, product details, and potential networking strategies. It could also help in drafting follow-up emails or summarizing key points from the events. However, the core aspect of attending these events and engaging in face-to-face interactions cannot be fully replaced by the LLM.

- **E2**: While the LLM could be used to research industry trends, gather information on products, and even provide some networking tips, the task of physically attending sales meetings, trade shows, and training seminars is not something that can be significantly expedited or enhanced by additional software built on top of the LLM. The core requirement of personal presence and interaction remains essential.

- **E3**: The task does not involve any image-related activities that would benefit from additional image capabilities alongside the LLM. Therefore, this task does not fall under the E3 category.
