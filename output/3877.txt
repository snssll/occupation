1: In this task of counting money and auditing money drawers, the main activities involve handling cash, verifying amounts, and ensuring accuracy in financial transactions. An LLM could potentially assist in providing guidelines or best practices for counting money accurately, but it may not significantly reduce the time it takes to physically count and audit money drawers. The task is very hands-on and requires physical interaction with cash and drawers, which cannot be directly replaced by the LLM. Therefore, the exposure to LLM for this task would likely be classified as E0, as the LLM would not substantially decrease the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete the task with high quality.
