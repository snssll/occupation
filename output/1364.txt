1: For the task of attaching identifying tags to containers or marking them with identifying information, the exposure to LLM can be evaluated as follows:

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** The task involves a straightforward and repetitive action of attaching tags or marking containers with information. The LLM can assist in generating standardized tag designs, providing instructions on how to mark containers, or even generating the identifying information itself based on specific criteria. The LLM can easily reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality by at least half by providing templates, suggestions, or even generating the entire content needed for identification.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the task is relatively simple and can benefit from LLM assistance, it may not require additional software beyond the LLM itself to complete the task efficiently. The LLM's text generation capabilities are sufficient to aid in creating identifying tags or information for containers. Therefore, the development of additional software on top of the LLM may not significantly enhance the completion of this task.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** This task does not involve any image-related requirements, such as reading text from images or creating/editing digital images. Therefore, the image capabilities of the LLM are not relevant in this context.
