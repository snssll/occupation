1: In this task, a detective or criminal investigator is required to search for and collect evidence, such as fingerprints, using investigative equipment. This task involves physical actions like searching, handling equipment, and collecting physical evidence. While an LLM can provide information on investigative techniques, legal procedures, and other related knowledge, it cannot physically collect evidence. The task also involves real-world interactions and physical movements that cannot be replicated by the LLM. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not involve text-based activities that can be significantly aided by the LLM.
