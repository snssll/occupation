1: In this task, a retail salesperson is required to watch for and recognize security risks and thefts, as well as know how to prevent or handle these situations. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes for a retail salesperson to learn about security risks, theft prevention, and handling procedures. 

Given that this task involves real-time observation, quick decision-making, and physical intervention if necessary, it is unlikely that the LLM alone can provide the practical skills and physical presence required to effectively handle security risks and thefts in a retail setting. While the LLM could potentially provide theoretical information on security measures and theft prevention strategies, the practical application and real-time decision-making aspects of this task are better suited for human judgment and physical intervention.
