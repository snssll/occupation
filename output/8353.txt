1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of interpreting and explaining plans and contract terms to representatives in the construction management field, we need to consider the nature of the task. This task involves a significant amount of communication, explanation, and interpretation of complex information related to construction projects. While an LLM could potentially assist in generating explanations or summaries of plans and contract terms, the task also requires a deep understanding of the specific context, regulations, and nuances of the construction industry.

Therefore, the task is not solely about generating text but also about interpersonal communication and domain-specific knowledge.
