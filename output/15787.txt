1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of setting up and operating ground support and test equipment to perform functional flight tests of electrical and electronic systems as an Avionics Technician, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be aided by the use of a large language model (LLM).

- Avionics Technicians require specialized knowledge and skills related to aircraft electronics and systems. The task involves setting up and operating equipment for flight tests, which requires technical expertise and understanding of complex systems.
- While an LLM could potentially assist in providing general information about avionics systems or basic procedures, the task itself is hands-on and involves physical equipment operation, which cannot be directly replaced by text-based assistance.
- The task does not involve writing, summarizing documents, or accessing specialized domain knowledge that an LLM could significantly enhance or expedite.
- The task also does not involve image processing or detailed visual analysis that would benefit from additional capabilities beyond text-based assistance.

Based on these considerations, the task of setting up and operating ground support and test equipment as an Avionics Technician would be classified as E0 - No exposure to LLM.
