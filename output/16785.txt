1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of teaching classes using online technology as an English Language and Literature Teacher, Postsecondary, we need to consider the capabilities of the LLM. In this case, the LLM can assist in various ways such as providing lesson plans, generating discussion questions, creating quizzes, offering feedback on student assignments, and even simulating student interactions for practice. The LLM can also help in preparing training materials and providing information on teaching strategies. However, the actual act of teaching using online technology involves real-time interaction, adapting to student responses, and providing personalized feedback, which the LLM alone cannot fully replicate. While the LLM can provide valuable resources and support, the core aspect of teaching, especially in an online setting, requires human intervention and adaptability.
