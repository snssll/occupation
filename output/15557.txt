1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of selecting sizes and types of molds according to instructions for Molders, Shapers, and Casters, Except Metal and Plastic, we need to consider the nature of the task. This task involves following specific instructions to choose molds, which can be a straightforward process based on given criteria. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The task of selecting molds based on instructions can be easily accomplished by the LLM through text input and output. The model can understand the criteria provided and generate a list of suitable sizes and types of molds accordingly. This would significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality.
  
- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the task itself is relatively simple and can be handled by the LLM directly, there may not be a need for additional software beyond the LLM to complete this task more efficiently. The straightforward nature of the task does not require complex document summarization, fact retrieval, or specialized domain knowledge.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - This task does not involve image processing or detailed visual analysis, so the image capabilities of the LLM are not relevant in this context.
