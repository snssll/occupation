1: In this task, a Quality Control Systems Manager is required to evaluate new testing and sampling methodologies or technologies to determine their usefulness. To determine the exposure level to LLM, we need to consider if the task can be significantly aided by the capabilities of the LLM. 

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** If the task involves researching and understanding new testing and sampling methodologies, the LLM can assist in providing information on these methodologies, their applications, and potential benefits. The LLM can help in summarizing existing research, providing insights into the effectiveness of different methodologies, and even generating reports or recommendations based on the data provided. This direct access to information and analysis could significantly reduce the time it takes to evaluate new methodologies.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the LLM can provide information and insights, it may not have direct access to the most up-to-date information on the latest testing and sampling technologies unless explicitly provided in the input. However, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM that could search for and retrieve the latest information from the internet, analyze trends in methodologies, and provide recommendations based on this data. Such software could enhance the capabilities of the LLM in assisting with the evaluation process.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Image capabilities are not directly relevant to this task as it primarily involves evaluating methodologies and technologies related to testing and sampling, which are text-based concepts. Therefore, image capabilities would not significantly impact the completion of this task.
