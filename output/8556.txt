1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of investigating or reviewing the carbon footprints and environmental performance records of storage and distribution service providers as a Supply Chain Manager, we need to consider the nature of the task and the capabilities of the LLM.

- The task involves researching and analyzing environmental data related to storage and distribution service providers.
- The LLM can assist in summarizing existing documents, providing insights based on general knowledge, and potentially even retrieving some relevant information from the internet.
- While the LLM can help with text-based tasks, it may not have direct access to up-to-date environmental performance records unless explicitly provided in the input.
- The task does not involve detailed visual analysis or require specialized domain knowledge beyond what the LLM can provide.

Based on these considerations, the task falls under E1 as the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes to gather and analyze information related to carbon footprints and environmental performance records, providing valuable insights and summaries to the Supply Chain Manager.
