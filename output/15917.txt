1: In this task, a stonemason is required to shape, trim, face, and cut marble or stone using various tools. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider if access to the LLM can significantly reduce the time it takes for an experienced worker to complete this task with high quality. Since this task involves physical work with power saws, cutting equipment, and hand tools, it does not seem feasible for the LLM to directly assist in completing the task. The LLM cannot perform physical tasks or interact with physical objects, so it cannot replace the manual labor involved in stonemasonry.
