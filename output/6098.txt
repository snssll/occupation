1: In this task, the self-enrichment teacher is responsible for enforcing policies and rules governing students. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone or with additional software could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality.

- E0: This task involves human interaction and decision-making that cannot be automated by the LLM or any software built on top of it. Enforcing policies and rules governing students requires judgment, empathy, and understanding of individual circumstances, which are not within the capabilities of the LLM.
- E1: The LLM could potentially assist in drafting written policies or guidelines based on general knowledge, but the actual enforcement of these policies and rules would still require human intervention. The LLM could not directly enforce policies or rules governing students.
- E2: While software could potentially be developed to help organize and track policies and rules, as well as provide recommendations based on data, the core task of enforcing policies and rules governing students would still heavily rely on human judgment and interaction. The LLM alone would not significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task.
- E3: Image capabilities would not be relevant for this task as it does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images.
