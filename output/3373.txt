1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of configuring, monitoring, and maintaining email applications or virus protection software as a Network and Computer Systems Administrator, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can be impacted by the use of the LLM.

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** The task involves technical knowledge and expertise in setting up and managing email applications and virus protection software. While the LLM can provide general information and guidance on these topics, the specific configurations and monitoring processes may require hands-on experience and real-time troubleshooting, which the LLM may not be able to provide directly.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** It is conceivable that specialized software could be developed on top of the LLM to assist in automating certain aspects of configuring, monitoring, and maintaining email applications or virus protection software. This software could potentially analyze logs, detect anomalies, and suggest solutions based on patterns identified by the LLM.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Image capabilities would not significantly impact the task of configuring, monitoring, and maintaining email applications or virus protection software, as the task primarily involves working with software configurations and monitoring tools rather than visual data.

Considering the above points, the task of configuring, monitoring, and maintaining email applications or virus protection software as a Network and Computer Systems Administrator is best classified as **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications)**.
