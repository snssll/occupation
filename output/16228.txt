1: In this task, the occupation involves starting races and competitions, which requires physical presence and action. This task cannot be completed solely through text input and output. While the LLM could potentially provide information or guidelines on how to start races and competitions, the actual act of starting them requires physical interaction and cannot be automated by the LLM. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not meet the criteria for exposure to LLM capabilities.

2: E0

3: High
