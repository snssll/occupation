1: In this task, the Loan Interviewers and Clerks are responsible for filing and maintaining loan records. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task with equivalent quality. 

- E1: Direct exposure - The LLM can assist in writing and organizing text, which could be helpful in maintaining loan records. It can help in creating digital records, organizing information, and potentially even setting reminders for follow-ups. This could streamline the process significantly.
- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While the LLM alone may not reduce the time by half for this task, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to automate the organization of loan records, provide reminders for important dates, and even generate reports based on the data. This could enhance efficiency.
- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not relevant for this task as it primarily involves text-based record-keeping and organization.

Considering the above points, the task of filing and maintaining loan records could benefit from the assistance of the LLM, especially in organizing and managing textual information.
