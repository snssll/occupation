1: In this task, the Fallers occupation involves tagging unsafe trees with high-visibility ribbons. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider if access to the LLM alone or with additional software could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task with equivalent quality.

- E0: This task involves physical work outdoors, tagging trees, which cannot be automated by the LLM or any software tool. The task requires human judgment, physical presence, and interaction with the environment, making it unsuitable for automation using the LLM.

- E1: The task of tagging unsafe trees with ribbons is a manual, physical task that cannot be directly automated by the LLM. While the LLM could potentially provide information on tree safety or guidelines for tagging, the actual tagging process requires physical presence and action, which the LLM cannot perform.

- E2: It is conceivable that software could be developed on top of the LLM to assist Fallers in identifying unsafe trees more efficiently or providing safety guidelines. However, the core task of physically tagging trees with ribbons would still require human intervention and cannot be fully automated by the LLM alone.

- E3: The task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images. Therefore, the image capabilities provided by the LLM are not relevant to this task.

2: E0

3: Certainty level: High
