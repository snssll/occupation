1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of creating system images or capturing network settings as a Digital Forensics Analyst, we need to consider the nature of the task and how it can benefit from the use of a large language model (LLM).

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** Using an LLM directly could potentially reduce the time it takes to complete this task by providing guidance on best practices for creating system images or capturing network settings. The LLM could assist in generating detailed documentation or reports related to the evidence preservation process.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While an LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time to complete this task, additional software built on top of the LLM could enhance the process. For example, an application that can automatically analyze system images or network settings for anomalies or provide recommendations based on forensic analysis could be developed.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Image capabilities are not directly relevant to the task of creating system images or capturing network settings in digital forensics. This task primarily involves working with data and configurations rather than visual content.
