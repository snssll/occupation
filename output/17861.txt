1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of writing articles or pamphlets about products as a Demonstrator and Product Promoter, we need to consider the level of exposure to LLM.

- E1: Direct exposure - If the task involves writing and transforming text about products according to complex instructions, providing edits to existing text following specifications, or summarizing information to create articles or pamphlets, then direct access to the LLM could significantly reduce the time needed to complete the task with equivalent quality. The LLM can assist in generating content, refining language, and ensuring the information is engaging and informative.

- E2: Exposure by LLM-powered applications - While having access to the LLM alone may not reduce the time to complete the task by half, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to summarize product information, retrieve up-to-date facts about products, or provide recommendations based on data. Such software could enhance the efficiency of creating articles or pamphlets by streamlining research and content generation processes.

- E3: Exposure given image capabilities - Image capabilities are not directly relevant to the task of writing articles or pamphlets about products. Therefore, this task does not fall under E3.

Considering the nature of the task and the potential for the LLM to assist in generating content, refining language, and providing information about products, the most suitable label appears to be E1.

2: E1

3: Moderate
