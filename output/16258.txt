1: In this task, a Print Binding and Finishing Worker is required to stitch or glue endpapers, bindings, backings, or signatures using various machines and tools. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. The task involves manual labor and physical coordination to operate sewing machines, glue machines, and brushes. It requires a hands-on approach and the ability to handle materials effectively. Since the task is primarily physical and involves manual dexterity, it does not align with the capabilities of an LLM. The LLM cannot perform physical tasks or operate machinery. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not benefit from LLM capabilities.
