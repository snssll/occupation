1: In this task for Recreational Vehicle Service Technicians, the main activity involves connecting electrical systems to outside power sources and testing the operation of appliances or light fixtures. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the complexity of the task and the potential for the LLM to assist in completing it.

- E0: This task involves physical interaction with electrical systems and appliances, which cannot be directly assisted by the LLM. The task also requires hands-on testing and activation of switches, which cannot be done through text-based instructions alone.

- E1: While the LLM could potentially provide guidance on how to connect electrical systems or troubleshoot issues, the hands-on nature of the task and the need for physical testing make it unlikely that the LLM alone could reduce the time it takes to complete the task by at least half with equivalent quality.

- E2: It is conceivable that additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to provide step-by-step instructions or troubleshooting tips for connecting electrical systems in recreational vehicles. This software could potentially include interactive guides or simulations to assist technicians in testing the operation of appliances. However, the hands-on nature of the task still limits the extent to which the LLM alone could significantly reduce the time needed to complete the task.

- E3: The task does not involve image processing or detailed visual instructions that would require image capabilities in addition to text-based assistance from the LLM. Therefore, exposure to image capabilities would not significantly impact the completion of this task.
