1: To determine the appropriate label for the task of performing environmental quality work in field or office settings as an Environmental Engineering Technologist or Technician, we need to consider the level of exposure to LLM.

- E0: This task involves hands-on work in the field, which cannot be directly assisted by the LLM. Additionally, it may require specific measurements and observations that the LLM cannot provide.

- E1: While the task involves working in both field and office settings, which could involve writing reports or analyzing data that the LLM could assist with, the hands-on nature of the work and the need for practical environmental assessments may not be significantly aided by the LLM.

- E2: It is conceivable that software could be developed on top of the LLM to assist with data analysis, report writing, or providing recommendations based on environmental data. However, the practical fieldwork aspect of the task may not be directly impacted by the LLM alone.

- E3: The task does not involve image processing or detailed visual analysis, so the additional image capabilities provided by the LLM would not significantly impact the completion of the task.

Considering the above points, the task of performing environmental quality work in field or office settings as an Environmental Engineering Technologist or Technician is best classified as E0.

2: E0

3: Moderate
