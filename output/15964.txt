1: In this task, a construction laborer is required to signal equipment operators to facilitate alignment, movement, or adjustment of machinery, equipment, or materials. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we need to consider the nature of the task. This task involves physical actions and interactions on a construction site, which cannot be directly replaced by text-based interactions with an LLM. The task requires real-time communication and coordination, which is not within the capabilities of the LLM. Therefore, this task falls under E0 as it does not involve text-based interactions or tasks that can be automated by the LLM.
