1: In this task, an air traffic controller is responsible for alerting airport emergency services in cases of emergency or when aircraft are experiencing difficulties. To determine the appropriate label from the exposure rubric, we can break down the task as follows:

- The task involves a specific action based on predefined protocols and procedures. The information required to carry out this task is typically standardized and does not involve complex decision-making.
- The task does not involve writing or transforming text, providing edits, translating languages, summarizing documents, or generating questions.
- The task does not require accessing up-to-date facts from the internet or specialized domain knowledge beyond the standard procedures followed by air traffic controllers.
- The task does not involve analyzing written information to inform decisions, preparing training materials based on specialized knowledge, providing counsel on issues, or maintaining complex databases.
- The task does not involve reading text from PDFs, scanning images, or creating/editing digital images.

Based on the above analysis, the task of alerting airport emergency services as an air traffic controller falls under E0 as it does not significantly benefit from the capabilities of an LLM or any additional software tools in reducing the time it takes to complete the task.
