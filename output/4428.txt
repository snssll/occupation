1: Biostatisticians are professionals who work with biological data to analyze and interpret it. One of the tasks they may perform is designing or maintaining databases of biological data. To determine the exposure level of this task to LLM, we can consider that an LLM could potentially assist in creating or maintaining databases by providing guidance on data organization, suggesting best practices for database design, or even generating code snippets for database management. Since this task involves working with structured data and does not require precise measurements or detailed visuals, it is plausible that an LLM could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete this task by offering insights, recommendations, or even generating parts of the database structure.
