1: For the task of demonstrating the use or operation of merchandise as a Retail Salesperson, the exposure to LLM can be analyzed as follows:

- **E1 (Direct exposure):** The task involves explaining and demonstrating how merchandise works, which can be aided by the LLM in providing scripted explanations or step-by-step instructions on how to operate the products. The LLM can generate detailed descriptions and instructions based on the input provided, potentially reducing the time needed to prepare for demonstrations.

- **E2 (Exposure by LLM-powered applications):** While the LLM alone may not significantly reduce the time to complete the task, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM to create interactive product guides or virtual demonstrations that could enhance the demonstration process for Retail Salespersons.

- **E3 (Exposure given image capabilities):** Image capabilities would not significantly impact the task of demonstrating the use of merchandise, as the task primarily involves verbal and hands-on demonstrations rather than relying on visual aids.

Considering the above analysis, the task of demonstrating the use or operation of merchandise as a Retail Salesperson could best fit under **E1 (Direct exposure)** as the LLM can directly assist in providing detailed explanations and instructions for product demonstrations.
