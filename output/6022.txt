1: In this task, a Police Identification and Records Officer is required to dust selected areas of a crime scene and lift latent fingerprints while adhering to proper preservation procedures. To determine the appropriate exposure label, we need to consider the nature of the task. 

- The task involves specific instructions related to crime scene investigation techniques, which may require specialized knowledge and training.
- The task does not involve writing or transforming text, summarizing documents, or providing feedback on documents.
- While the task does involve physical actions like dusting and lifting fingerprints, the core of the task is related to following procedures and techniques rather than physical labor.
- The task does not involve highly specialized domain knowledge that an LLM alone can provide.
- The task does not involve analyzing written information to inform decisions or providing counsel on issues.

Based on these considerations, the task falls under E0 as it involves physical actions, specialized knowledge, and procedures that are not directly related to the capabilities of an LLM.
